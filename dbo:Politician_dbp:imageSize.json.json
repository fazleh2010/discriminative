  "text" : "William \"Bill\" McBride (May 10, 1945 – December 22, 2012) was an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he challenged Jeb Bush for Florida governor in the 2002 gubernatorial election. Bush won by a 56 to 43 percent margin, making him the first Republican governor of Florida to serve two terms. McBride had earlier defeated former United States Attorney General Janet Reno in the Democratic primary. McBride was born in Belleville, Illinois and grew up in Leesburg, Florida. He graduated from the University of Florida in 1967. While at UF, McBride served as treasurer of Florida Blue Key and was inducted into the University of Florida Hall of Fame. McBride served in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1971. McBride was awarded a Bronze Star with a Valor device. Upon his return to the United States, McBride taught at Officer Candidates School at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Upon leaving the Marine Corps, McBride attended the University of Florida Law School. While studying law he fell under the tutelage of Chesterfield Smith, a powerful politically connected Florida attorney and then president of the American Bar Association. McBride left law school for a time to serve as Smith's assistant at the ABA. After graduation, McBride joined Smith's Tampa law firm, Holland & Knight, where he rose in the ranks until becoming managing partner in 1992. McBride's tenure at the helm of Holland & Knight has been the source of some controversy. He is credited with having expanded the firm's size and power and with having helped to make it the seventh-largest firm in the U.S. by number of lawyers employed at the time of his retirement in 2001. At the time the firm ranked 21st in terms of revenue but 98th in terms of profit-per-partner, and had \"become known as a reputable, but flabby, operation, long on underproductive partners and comparatively short on workhorse associates.\" McBride was the father of two children with his wife, Adelaide \"Alex\" Sink, a former statewide president for NationsBank (now Bank of America), former Chief Financial Officer of Florida, and 2010 Democratic nominee for Governor of Florida. Since 2003, Bill McBride was partner with the law firm of Barnett, Bolt, Kirkwood, Long & McBride in Tampa. He was also chair of the board of the investment banking firm Hyde Park Capital Partners, LLC, with offices in Tampa and Charlotte, North Carolina. McBride was a member of the American Law Institute and was a member of the board of directors of the Warrington College of Business Administration's Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Florida. McBride was named Mr. Leesburg High while still a student. He attended Boy's State while in school and ran a successful campaign for governor at the event. McBride died on December 22, 2012, after suffering a heart attack while vacationing with his family in Mt Airy, North Carolina."

He was born in California to screenwriter John Michael Hayes and Mildred \"Mel\" (née Hicks) Hayes. Garrett was raised in Maine and moved back to California in 1969, where he later attended Beverly Hills High School and California State College at Bakersfield. He moved to Georgia in 1991 and currently serves as the secretary of the Cobb County Libertarian Party. After serving in a number of roles with the both county and state Libertarian organizations in Georgia, Hayes sought and won the party nomination for governor in 2002 and again in 2006. Hayes received 2.3% of the vote in 2003 and 3.8% of the vote in 2006. In his second run at office, Hayes set several benchmarks for third party politics in the state, beginning with being the first Libertarian to run twice for governor. Hayes’s campaign was the first Libertarian gubernatorial campaign to produce and run television advertisements in Georgia. He also garnered the highest polling numbers to date for a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate in the state, polling as high as 9% in one non-partisan poll, leading to press speculation that Hayes might force an unprecedented runoff electionbetween incumbent Republican Sonny Perdue and Democratic rival Lieutenant Governor Mark Taylor. Though a runoff did not in fact result, Hayes still gathered both the highest number and the highest percentage of votes for a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate in Georgia. Hayes currently co-hosts a weekly Libertarian-themed political radio talk show on radio station WHIE in Griffin, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta."
