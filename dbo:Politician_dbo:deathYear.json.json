  "text" : "Kathleen D'Olier Courtney was born the youngest of five daughters and the fifth of seven children of Lieutenant (later Major) David Charles Courtney (1845-1909) of the Royal Engineers (a native of Milltown, County Dublin, Ireland), and his wife, Alice Margaret (née Mann) at 1 York Terrace, was born in Gillingham on 11 March 1878. Courtney attended and became educated at the private the Anglo-French College in Kensington and the Manse boarding-school in Malvern before spending seven months in Dresden studying the German language. In January 1897 she went to Lady Margaret Hall to study modern languages. The Courtney family were extremely wealthy and never had to worry about finances and in that case, she decided to devote her life to good causes where she was able to help people. In 1908 she was appointed secretary of the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage. One of its members, Helena Swanwick, later revealed that Courtney arrived in Manchester \"with a big reputation\" as an outstanding organizer. In 1911 she moved to London where she worked closely with Millicent Fawcett, an English feminist, intellectual, political and union leader, and writer as honorary secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. A suffragist and Honorary Secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she abandoned her active campaigning for women's suffrage and devoted her life to studying international politics and trying to build bridges towards international cooperation. In April 1915, Aletta Jacobs, a suffragist in the Netherlands, invited suffrage members all over the world to an International Congress of Women in The Hague. Some of the women who attended included Kathleen Courtney, Mary Sheepshanks, Jane Addams, Alice Hamilton, Grace Abbott, Emily Bach,de:Lida Gustava Heymann, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Emily Hobhouse, Chrystal Macmillan, Rosika Schwimmer. At the conference the women formed the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WIL). Kathleen Courtney ultimately was elected as chairperson of the British section. In 1928, she was named a member of the Executive Committee of the British League of Nations Union. In 1939 (the year WWII would begin) she was elected Vice-Chairman. From 1949 to 1951 she served as Chairman. Courtney continued to be involved in the campaign for women's suffrage. She helped establish the Adult Suffrage Society in 1916 and as joint-secretary she lobbied members of the House of Commons for extension of the franchise until the Qualification of Women Act was passed in 1918. The following year she became vice-president of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship. As well as advocating the same voting rights as men, the organisation also campaigned for equal pay, fairer divorce laws and an end to the discrimination against women in the professions. Kathleen Courtney died at her home, unmarried with no children, at 3 Elm Tree Court on 7 December 1974 at age 96. A memorial service was held on 11 April 1975 at St Martin-in-the-Fields."

  "text" : "Jim Sinclair (June 3, 1933 – November 9, 2012), was a Non-Status Indian leader from Punnichy, Saskatchewan, Canada. Despite his Non-Status, rather than Métis, background, for many years he was one of the pre-eminent Métis leaders in Canada. Jim served as president of the Métis Society of Saskatchewan, and the Association of Métis and Non-Status Indians of Saskatchewan (AMNSIS), forerunners of the contemporary Métis Nation - Saskatchewan. He had a difficult youth as a road allowance person, and struggled with alcohol addiction. After beating his addiction Jim worked extensively at community level organization among his people, to get them to sober up, take responsibility for their lives, and to lead others in the struggle for their rights. He learned to become an expert at using the media, at using confrontation politics to force government to deal with peoples' immediate needs and rights. He focused on issues such as housing, institutional racism, Aboriginal land rights, hunting, fishing, and trapping rights, and education. He was part of the team who helped to establish a major network of alcohol treatment centers, along with the Gabriel Dumont Institute of Métis Studies and Applied Research. In 1987, during the Canadian constitutional talks that led to the Meech Lake Accord, Sinclair took a strong stance against Premiers Grant Devine of Saskatchewan and Bill Vander Zalm of British Columbia for what he saw as their antagonism to Métis rights. From 1994 to 1996, Mr. Sinclair led the national Congress of Aboriginal Peoples. From 1996 up until his death he was President of the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples of Saskatchewan. Sinclair was awarded the Order of the Métis Nation in 2004 for a lifetime of service to the Aboriginal community.On October 25, 2012, he was honoured at the Saskatchewan Indian Nation Assembly. Sinclair died on November 9, 2012, at the age of 79 after battling cancer."

  "text" : "Thomas Livingstone Learmonth (1818-1903) was an early Victorian settler who established land around Ballarat, Victoria. Learmonth was the son of Thomas Learmonth, a well-known settler in Tasmania, and was born in 1818. Having been attracted to the new settlement at Port Phillip, he started with a pioneering party from the shores of Corio Bay, in August 1837, to explore the unknown country to the north-west, directing their course, in the first instance, to Mount Buninyong, near to which, in conjunction with his brother, Somerville Livingstone Learmonth, Mr. T. L. Learmonth subsequently entered on pastoral pursuits on the fine country the party then discovered farther to the north-west. In the following year the two brothers and some friends explored the course of the Loddon, and reached a prominent peak, which they afterwards called Ercildoune, from an old keep on the Scottish border associated with their ancestral history. Here the brothers established a second station. After many years of prosperity the Messrs. Learmonth disposed of their Buninyong property, and subsequently sold the famous Ercildoune estate to Sir Samuel Wilson. Mr. Learmonth was for some time a member of the Upper House in Victoria, and finally left for England in 1868. Mr. Learmonth, later lived at Park Hall, Polmont, N.B., and was a J. P. for Stirlingshire, married, firstly, in 1857, Louisa, daughter of Major-General Sir Thomas Valiant, who died in 1878; and, secondly, in 1879, Jane Florence Harriett, daughter of Lestock Reid, of the Bombay Civil Service. He died in 1903."

He was also the father of Tom Wills, Australia's first great cricketer and inventor of Australian rules football. The Argus newspaper of 12 March 1921 records the Horatio Wills family being at Burra Burra Gundagai till around 1840. Thomas Wills, Horatio's son, was born in 1836 near Gundagai, New South Wales. Wills was one of the first settlers of the Ararat district in western Victoria, Australia, at a 125,000-acre (510 km2) property named Lexington near Moyston. Wills intended to build a house on the property which was finally completed in 1845. While at Lexington he is credited as having named nearby Mount Ararat. He hired aborigines as station hands and harvesters on his property. In 1852, Wills sold Lexington and moved to Belle Vue in Geelong. Wills was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council for Grant on 10 January 1855; and was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for South Grant in November 1856, a position he held until August 1859. In 1861, Horatio moved north to Queensland, at Cullin-La-Ringo in the Nogoa region near Rockhampton. Just three weeks later, Horatio was murdered by aborigines, along with 18 others at the Cullin-la-ringo massacre, 17 October 1861; the biggest massacre of whites by Aboriginal people in Australian history."

He served as Labor's whip while the party was in Opposition during the 1990s. On 13 May 2006, The Age newspaper in Melbourne published two articles alleging Seitz had been involved in branch stacking within his electorate, using the proceeds of community bingo games and a rental apartment to pay for memberships to the Labor Party. It was alleged that Seitz used his influence within the ALP to secure 2007 pre-selection for prominent Labor Right faction leader Bill Shorten to run for Federal Parliament (Seitz is a member of the Labor Unity faction, within Labor Right), and in return a Shorten-led party administrative committee allowed Seitz to continue serving in Victorian Parliament past the usual retirement age of 65. Former Victorian Premier John Cain said of Seitz, \"His parliamentary career is eminently forgettable. I think the most I can say is that he was a backbench warrior who was out there in the local electorate doing a lot of branch-stacking and enjoying it.\" Seitz has denied The Age's allegations. He died in 2015."
