  "text" : "Robert Law McCartney, QC (born 24 April 1936) is a Northern Irish barrister and a former leader of the UK Unionist Party. He was initially a member of the Ulster Unionist Party but was expelled in June 1987 when he refused to withdraw from the general election of that year. He stood against the incumbent Popular Unionist Party MP Sir James Kilfedder in North Down as a \"Real Unionist\" but failed to win the seat. In the 1995 by-election in North Down after the death of Kilfedder he was elected as a \"UK Unionist\" defeating the Ulster Unionist Party candidate. He subsequently established the United Kingdom Unionist Party to contest elections to the Northern Ireland Forum and the related talks which startedin 1996. The other party representatives to the Forum were Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien and Cedric Wilson, a former low-level DUP member in the 1980s. McCartney retained his Westminster seat in the 1997 election. He opposed the subsequent Belfast Agreement in the May 1998 referendum and his party won five seats in the Assembly elections later that year (McCartney himself in North Down, Cedric Wilson in Strangford, Patrick Roche in Lagan Valley, Norman Boyd in South Antrim and Roger Hutchinson East Antrim). However, Wilson, Roche, Boyd and Hutchinson parted company with McCartney in December 1998 because of their leader's so-called 'exit strategy' from the Northern Ireland Assembly in the event of Sinn Féin being allowed seats in the new Northern Ireland Government. McCartney denounced them, saying all four 'were famous in their own living rooms' and that their supporters 'could fit into a telephone box.' In 2008 both Wilson and Boyd attended meetings of Jim Allister's Traditional Unionist Voice. In 1999, Robert McCartney ran for the party in elections to the European Parliament, winning 2.9% of the first preference vote. He lost his Westminster seat in the 2001 election to the UUP candidate Lady Hermon. He was committed to a policy of integration for Northern Ireland, whereby legislative devolution for Northern Ireland would no longer be Westminster's abiding policy, there would be no Stormont legislative assembly and the province would be a fully participating part of the United Kingdom; at the same time the three main British political parties would fully organise in Northern Ireland. He was the president of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1986, and led it in its four years of prominence after the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. McCartney resigned as head of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1988 over a dispute with its executive. These integrationist policies, once popular in some sections of Unionism, receded with the introduction of devolution to Scotland and Wales, and the creation of a functioning Northern Ireland Assembly. However it is the case that other parts of the United Kingdom with devolved assemblies are fully covered by the three main British political parties, but not in Northern Ireland. McCartney also strongly opposed the St Andrews Agreement and in 2007 stood on an anti-agreement ticket in six different constituencies. He lost his own seat in North Down, polling 1,806 first preference votes (5.9% of the total, and less than half the quota required to be elected). He also obtained 360 votes (1.2%) in Belfast North, 388 votes (0.8%) in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, 853 votes (2.0%) in Lagan Valley, 893 votes (2.3%) in South Antrim and 220 votes (0.5%) in West Tyrone He claims to have retired from politics following the loss of his seat in the 2007 Assembly Election to Brian Wilson of the Green Party. However, he still occasionally makes media appearances and writes newspaper articles and in October 2009, Robert McCartney was guest speaker at the Traditional Unionist Voice party conference in Belfast, where he spoke on the situation surrounding the primary school transfer test, brought about by a Sinn Féin Education Minister."

Morgan is an insurance broker and cattle farmer from Pinehurst, North Carolina. In 2003, the House found itself evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. Morgan led a Republican faction that agreed to form a coalition with the Democrats. The coalition elected two \"co-speakers\" of the House for the first time in state history, for the North Carolina General Assembly of 2003-2004. Speaker Jim Black, a Democrat, was called the \"Democratic Speaker,\" and Morgan was called the \"Republican Speaker.\" A number of Republicans—but less than a majority of the Republican caucus—considered Morgan's actions tantamount to betraying his party. Rep. Morgan's actions gave him and Speaker Black control of redistricting in 2003, and allowed him to make some appointments to important committees. As Republican Leader, Morgan had also essentially run a statewide campaign leading to the election of five new Republicans and one loss for a net gain of five to help Republicans reach a majority. The state was said to have run more smoothly and more efficiently with the new leadership. Rep. Morgan was removed from the North Carolina Republican Party's Executive Committee in May 2004 for \"party disloyalty.\"  In the 2006 election he was defeated by a Republican opponent in the primary. In 2008, Morgan ran for North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction, losing to June Atkinson. In 2010, he ran for the State Senate but lost in the Republican primary to incumbent Harris Blake."

  "text" : "Robert C. Carpenter (June 18, 1924 – August 6, 2011) was a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly. He represented the state's fiftieth Senate district, including constituents in Cherokee, Clay, Graham, Haywood, Jackson, Macon, Swain and Transylvania counties. A retired bank executive from Franklin, North Carolina, Carpenter was elected to the state senate in 1988. He served eight terms, finally losing his seat in 2004 by fewer than 300 votes. Carpenter was born in Franklin, North Carolina and graduated from Franklin High School in 1942. He briefly attended Western Carolina University before undergoing flight training at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and flying with the United States Navy during World War II (from 1943 to 1945). After the war, he graduated from the University of Virginia School of Consumer Banking and served as a bank executive in Franklin until his retirement. Carpenter married twice. His first wife, Ruth, died of cancer on September 15, 1985. Carpenter then married T. Helen Edwards Bryant on January 18, 1986. He had eight children with his first wife. He is the father-in-law of former North Carolina Representative Marge Carpenter (R). He was a member of the Franklin Rotary Club for 50 years. He died in 2011. After Carpenter's death in 2011, county commissioners unanimously approved a resolution Tuesday, March 18, 2014, to memorialize his life, with the county’s community building located on the Georgia Road to be known as the Robert C. Carpenter Community Facilities Building. Carpenter’s wife attended the meeting and was herself recognized for her service to the community. Carpenter worked in politics for much of his life, working on the local level as a county commissioner, and on a national level during eight terms as a North Carolina State Senator. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention. Locally, he served as President of the Franklin Chamber of Commerce and as Honorary Chairman for the Relay for Life. He worked on behalf of community colleges, serving 20 years on the Southwestern Community College Board of Trustees as well as President of the North Carolina Association of Community Colleges. Carpenter received many awards and recognitions including the State of North Carolina Distinguished Service Award, the NC Knights of Columbus Knight of the Year Award and Macon County Citizen of the Year recognition. He was a recipient of the Order of Long Leaf Pine Award, awarded by the governor of North Carolina. Carpenter spent many hours volunteering his time to baseball; he started Franklin’s Little League Baseball, coached Little League Baseball for 30 years, and was the first coach to recruit African Americans to play Little League Baseball in Asheville. For his work with baseball he received the Coach of the Year award and the Franklin Little League award. Carpenter was involved in many local organizations including the Optimist Club, Rotary Club, Jaycees and Knights of Columbus. He was on the Smokey Mountain Mental Health Board and served on the Governor’s NC Council on Developmental Disabilities. Carpenter was instrumental in establishing the county’s Highway 441 Welcome Center and the Veteran’s Clinic in Franklin, and in getting a natural gas line to western North Carolina."

He is the Ulster Unionist Party spokesperson on Social Development. In 2003, Beggs succeeded in having Irish rebel music removed from the in-flight entertainment of Aer Lingus airplanes. He complained of the \"Blatant promotion of opposing points of view\" on a music channel during a flight from Dublin to Boston after seeing that Derek Warfield had a radio channel dedicated to his music. Beggs, it was the same as \"the speeches of Osama Bin Laden being played on a trans-Atlantic Arabian airline.\" Aer Lingus removed the material from their flights stating: \"It is something that should not have been on board and we removed it immediately we became aware of it.\""

  "text" : "Robert Lindsay (c. 1735 – 1801) was an American politician who was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly of 1777. Robert Lindsay was the son of John Lindsay, but there are conflicting accounts as to their background and Robert's early life. One account says he was born c. 1735. He may have been born in Virginia or Ireland. He was descended from the ancient and illustrious Clan Lindsay of Scotland. Evidently, he lived for a time on the Pennsylvania/Maryland border area before coming to North Carolina in the mid-18th century. His name first appears in the North Carolina records in 1763. He died in 1801. Lindsay established a 2,000 acre (8 km²) plantation on Deep River in what later became Guilford County. In fact, when the county was formed in 1771, and until a court house could be built in 1774, the county court met in the \"great hall\" of his plantation home. The property included an ordinary (an inn/tavern), formal gardens, a mulberry grove for raising silk worms, a silk mill, a grist mill, and a store. A fragment of the original house remains. Robert Lindsay was a Captain in the North Carolina Militia. He served in the first independent North Carolina Legislature from 1777 to 1778, and was presiding Judge of Guilford County from 1781 to 1788. He was a well known and respected member of his community, and his descendants were prominent in the history of North Carolina. Robert married twice: 1."

In the 38th Parliament Fleming was the New Democrat critic for Advanced Education, sat on the Select Standing Committee on Education, and introduced two education-related private member bills: the Private Post-Secondary Accountability and Student Protection Act, 2007 and the Restoring Credibility to Universities Act, 2008. He was also assigned to the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts and introduced the Payday Lending Act, 2006 which sought to regulate the conditions of payday loans and led to the government adopting the Business Practices and Consumer Protection (Payday Loans) Amendment Act a year later. In the 39th Parliament Fleming became the NDP's environment critic. He introduced the Cosmetic Pesticide and Carcinogen Control Act and sat on the subsequent Special Committee on Cosmetic Pesticides which investigated potential bans or regulations on pesticides used for cosmetic purposes. Fleming also introduced the Species at Risk Protection Act, after the government delayed a promise to review its species-at-risk legislation, and the Sustainable Development Indicators and Reporting Act, 2011 which sought to create a Sustainable Development Board to report on provincial sustainability-related indicators. Fleming sat on the Select Standing Committee on Legislative Initiatives which considered the petition seeking the repeal of the Harmonized Sales Tax."

Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, he emigrated to Canada with his wife in 1891 settling in Nanaimo, British Columbia. A miner by trade, Smith was a moderate trade unionist in Nanaimo. In 1898, he won election to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on a moderate \"Liberal-Labour\" platform. He ran for Vancouver's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1900 federal election. Reports vary on whether he ran as an Independent Labour-Liberal candidate defeating the official Liberal and Conservative candidates, but once elected, he joined the Liberal caucus. He was re-elected in the 1904 and 1908 elections as a Liberal. He was defeated in the 1911 election. Smith subsequently returned to provincial politics and, returned to the provincial legislature in the 1916 provincial election that brought the British Columbia Liberal Party to power. Smith served as Minister of Finance in the government of Premier Harlan Carey Brewster, and died in office on February 17, 1917. His wife, Mary Ellen Smith, succeeded him in the subsequent by-election (held January 1918) as an Independent Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). She subsequently became the first female cabinet minister in the British Empire. Ralph Smith was a supporter of women's suffrage, which was enacted in the province shortly after the Liberals came to power after ten previous attempts over the years had failed."

At the time this was the largest riding in Canada. Sykes was acclaimed at a nomination meeting with over six-hundred members in attendance. Despite being the only Liberal candidate endorsed by the Calgary Sun that year, he lost to Progressive Conservative Alex Kindy in the general election. Sykes was born in 1929 in Montreal, Quebec, and was primarily raised in Victoria, British Columbia. He attended Sir George Williams University in Montreal. He and his wife Gisèle (Deceased) have five children and fourteen grandchildren. He also has a sister, Anne, who lives in Victoria."

He retired from Parliament at the 1997 general election. He was known as a hard-line left-winger who opposed any policy moves which he saw as edging Labour away from pure socialism. He once branded Neil Kinnock a \"traitor\" over the latter's denunciation of the Militant tendency activists who dominated local government on Merseyside. In 1992, Parry was arrested in Beijing when he and his colleagues unfurled a banner in Tiananmen Square protesting the shootings which had taken place there in 1989."

  "text" : "Ronald John Withnall (9 December 1914 – 16 September 1990) was an Australian politician and lawyer. Withnall was born in Townsville, Queensland, but attended school at Canterbury High School in Sydney. He studied law at the University of Sydney and later moved to the Northern Territory. He served as the Crown Law Officer for the Territory from 1954 to 1968, when he was elected to the Northern Territory Legislative Council, the forerunner to the current Legislative Assembly. In the same year, Withnall also became the inaugural President of the Law Society of the Northern Territory. As a Member of the Legislative Council, Withnall made a name for himself as a fierce advocate of self-determination, and took part in the campaign which ultimately led to the creation of the Assembly in 1974. He ran as an independent in the seat of Port Darwin in the first elections, and ultimately became one of only two non-Country Liberal Party members (the other being fellow independent Dawn Lawrie) in the first Assembly. However, he was to only serve one term in the Assembly, and was replaced by the Country Liberal Party's Tom Harris. Withnall died in late 1990, and several condolence motions were presented in the Assembly upon his death. Shane Stone, in his introductory speech upon his election to the Port Darwin electorate in 1990, referred to Withnall as a \"fearless and uncompromising advocate of self-government and statehood for the Territory\". In 1994, then-Chief Minister Marshall Perron also praised Withnall's role in the Territory's achievement of self-governance. A 1976 interview with Withnall is on file at the National Library of Australia."

He was admitted as an advocate in 1953, served as an Advocate Depute from 1964 to 1970 (from 1967 as a Senior Advocate Depute). He was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1967. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Caithness and Sutherland in 1959, Edinburgh North in a May 1960 by-election, and Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles in 1964 and 1965. He was elected and sat for Edinburgh Leith from 1970 until 1979. He served as Lord Advocate from March 1974 until May 1979, and was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1974. In 1979 he was appointed to the Court of Session and High Court of Justiciary as a Senator of the College of Justice, with the judicial title Lord Murray. His uncle David King Murray had been a Senator of the College of Justice from 1945 to 1955. In April 1977, the Young Liberals' annual conference unanimously passed a motion to call on the Liberal leader (David Steel) to move for the impeachment of Murray for allegedly mishandling a murder case. Despite the urgings of the then chairman of the Young Liberals, Peter Hain, Steel did not table such a motion in the House of Commons, but Murray agreed that the Commons still have the right to initiate an impeachment motion. Lord Murray was an active supporter of the World Court Project U.K., part of a worldwide network directed to obtaining a decision on the legality of using nuclear weapons. Success came in 1996, when the Court ruled, in an advisory opinion, that the use of such weapons and the threat to use them would generally be illegal as contrary to international humanitarian law. He died on 27 September 2016 at the age of 94."

He was the 20th mayor of Calgary, Alberta and a former Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta (MLA). Marshall was born in Ingersoll, Ontario in 1883 to parents Peter Marshall and Katherine Allen. He arrived in Calgary in 1906 and started working for the Crown Paving Company Limited. Marshall was associated with this company until its sale in 1961. In 1907, he married Annie Mae Batchelor, who died in 1915. Together they had one child, Margaret Alexandra, born in 1909. Marshall spent three years on Calgary City Council then went on to be mayor from January 2, 1919 to January 3, 1921. On July 19, 1919 — in his first year in office — he married Daisy Mary MacGregor. Together they had two children, Donald and Joan. He then moved on the provincial politics, running as a Liberal in the 1921 Alberta general election. He won his seat as MLA representing the Calgary electoral district, becoming a Liberal MLA just as the Liberals lost power to the United Farmers of Alberta. His level of support dropped significantly in the 1926 Alberta general election and was not re-elected. In 1928, Marshall moved to Edmonton and remained there until his retirement. He was involved in the YMCA, Rotary Club and the Alberta Union of Municipalities. He was a freemason and an oddfellow. He attempted to run for the Canadian House of Commons in Edmonton East as a Liberal candidate in a by-election held on March 21, 1938 but was defeated by Social Credit candidate Orvis A. Kennedy."

  "text" : "Richard Arthur Miller (July 23, 1960 – October 26, 2013) was born in Burns Lake, British Columbia. He was a politician in the Canadian province of Alberta and former member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. He was elected on November 22, 2004 in the 26th Alberta general election in Edmonton Rutherford, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative and former member of the Canadian House of Commons Ian McClelland. Miller served as opposition critic for two portfolios, the Treasury Board and Finance. He was also the chief opposition whip for the Alberta Liberal Party. He was defeated in the 2008 election by Progressive Conservative Fred Horne. In May 2005, Miller involved himself in the controversy surrounding the decision of then Conservative Belinda Stronach to cross the floor to the Liberals. After Tony Abbott, a fellow Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, made remarks comparing Stronach to a prostitute, Miller spoke out on the floor of the Legislative Assembly, condemning Abbott's remarks. After his speech, Abbott reportedly attempted to assault Miller in the corridor behind the Chamber. Due to a security guard's intervention, a major confrontation was prevented. This matter was resolved when Abbott apologized publicly for any perceived wrongs. Though Edmonton-Rutherford was perceived as an Alberta Liberal stronghold since the 1989 provincial election (in which Liberal MLA Percy Wickman defeated Premier Don Getty in his own riding), Rick Miller lost by 58 votes to PC candidate Fred Horne in 2008; this margin widened in the 2012 election. On October 26, 2013, Rick Miller died of prostate cancer in Edmonton, he was survived by his wife and two children."

A February 9, 2006 Chicago Tribune article written by Michael Hawthorne raised the issue of Cipriano registering as a lobbyist for Ameren less than a year after leaving public office. The article cites a 2003 ethics law barring state employees from working for companies they formerly regulated for at least one year. However, the article also stated that an EPA spokeswoman argued \"that the law doesn't apply to Cipriano's new job lobbying for a power company subject to scores of environmental regulations.\" Still, Cipriano has been the subject of much ridicule on the Web over the information contained in this article."

  "text" : "Clyde Robert Brawley is a former Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly. He represented the state's 43rd House district, including constituents in Catawba and Iredell counties (later the 101st district and now the 95th district) from 1981 until he retired in 1998. While in office, Brawley was elected the President of the National Republican Legislators Association and was named National Legislator of the Year in 1995. Brawley ran for North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance in 2004, losing to James E. Long. In 2012, Brawley was again elected to the House from the Iredell County-based 95th district. He won the May 8 Republican primary, which was tantamount to election, since no Democrat filed for the seat. Meanwhile, Brawley was also in 2012 named to lead the North Carolina chapter of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. In April 2013, Brawley filed House Bill 640 that would allow lobbyists to give unreported gifts to state lawmakers in North Carolina. In May 2013, Brawley resigned as chairman of the House Finance Committee in a dispute with House Speaker Thom Tillis. Brawley lost his bid for another term in the May 2014 Republican primary, with some of his colleagues in the House campaigning against him. Afterwards, the House Republican Caucus passed a vote of \"no confidence\" in Brawley, effectively barring him from caucus meetings. Brawley suggested that the censure was in retaliation for his criticism of Tillis. On December 9, 2015, Brawley announced his candidacy for the office of Governor of North Carolina, challenging current governor Pat McCrory."

  "text" : "Raymond John \"Ray\" Skelly (born July 1, 1941) is a former Canadian politician. A teacher by profession, Skelly was first elected as the New Democratic Party Member of Parliament for Comox—Powell River in the 1979 federal election. He served for fourteen years until being defeated in the 1993 federal election in the renamed riding of North Island--Powell River. This defeat was partly in response to the electorate's dissatisfaction with the provincial government led by New Democratic Party Premier Mike Harcourt. As a result, 15 of 17 incumbent New Democratic Party parliamentarians failed in their re-election bids in 1993. During his time in Parliament, Ray served as critic on a number of portfolios of particular concern to his constituents including Western economic development, fisheries, and mines & energy. He attempted a comeback in the 2000 federal election in Cariboo—Chilcotin but was defeated. He is the brother of fellow politician Bob Skelly. In the 1988 election, Ray and Bob pulled off a rare feat with both elected to the 34th Parliament and are currently the last siblings to have had the privilege to serve in Parliament together."

It was a very narrow win, garnering only 408 votes more than PC Candidate Bill Gottselig. In the 1993 election, he lost the seat to Reform Party candidate Allan Kerpan. His loss was even narrower that his initial win: only 320 votes separated him from the winner. During the 2002–2003 NDP leadership race, Laporte endorsed Bill Blaikie.

  "text" : "Richard L. Berkley (born Richard L. Berkowitz, June 29, 1931) served as mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., from 1979 to 1991. Although Kansas City mayors do not officially have political affiliations, Mayor Berkley was the first Republican mayor of the city since the 1920s, and its most recent one as of 2015. He was also the city's first Jewish mayor and served longer than any other mayor in Kansas City history. During his term he led the calls for a federal investigation into the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse in 1981. More than 700 capital improvement projects occurred during his term, including a major expansion of Bartle Hall Convention Center and revitalization of the Quality Hill neighborhood. Berkley received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1957. The Richard L. Berkley Riverfront Park on Front Street along the Missouri River near the Christopher \"Kit\" Bond Bridge(I-35) is named for him."

He was also a member of Durham County Council from 1947 to 1956. He was first elected to the House of Commons in a by-election in February 1956, following the death of the sitting MP, Labour's William Whiteley. He held the seat at the next six general elections, before stepping down from Parliament at the 1979 general election. In 1973, he and fellow Labour MP Tom Urwin were awarded costs and damages after being libelled by The Journal newspaper."

As the \"door keeper\" to the Prime Minister, he was well positioned to control information and access and proved himself instrumental in civil service appointments. He studied in Col. Brown Cambridge School, Dehra Dun and B.H.U. The head of the investigating commission, Justice M. P. Thakkar, described Mr. Dhawan's responses to questioning on the assassination as unreliable and said that the needle of suspicion significantly points to his complicity or involvement. However, Indira's son Rajiv after initially removing Dhawan from his post, cleared him of all charges."

In 1941 he married Katharine Wing. The couple had no children. At the 1966 general election, he was elected Member of Parliament for Cambridge, winning the seat by just 439 votes from the Conservatives at his third attempt, after the retirement of Hamilton Kerr. He had previously contested the seat in the general elections of 1959 and 1964, and also contested the surrounding seat of Cambridgeshire during a 1961 by-election. He died in office only fifteen months after being elected, aged 49, and the resulting by-election for his seat was won by the Conservative candidate, David Lane. Descended from a Welsh farming family, his grandfather, Jenkin Davies (1824–1893), was a leading Berkshire agriculturalist and County Councillor. The Davies Family History Website  has details of his pedigree."

In responding to Clayburgh's resignation, Governor John Hoeven described him as \"a dedicated servant of North Dakota for the past twenty years\" who had served with \"integrity and distinction\" and stated that he would be missed. Clayburgh was well-favored in his 2002 campaign for North Dakota's at-large congressional district against incumbent Democrat Earl Pomeroy, and ran an aggressive campaign including a visit from then-Vice President Dick Cheney in Fargo, North Dakota. He raised over US$1 million for the campaign. Despite the efforts, Pomeroy edged out Clayburgh and won re-election, with 52% of the vote."

  "text" : "Russell Cunningham (born December 29, 1904, date of death March 6, 1985) was a Canadian social democratic politician from Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. He was the leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in Nova Scotia from 1945 until 1953. He succeeded Donald MacDonald as the party's leader, after MacDonald lost his seat in the 1945 general election.He represented the electoral district (riding) of Cape Breton East in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1945 until 1956. Due to the Conservatives not electing a single member to the Assembly, Cunningham became the leader of the Official Opposition during the 44th General Assembly of Nova Scotia. Even though the CCF lost a seat, it was the first time they ever were the Official Opposition. Their successor party, the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party (NDP) would not duplicate that accomplishment again until 1998, over 50 years later. He was born in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia in 1904. Mr. Cunningham met and Married Violet Miller and had eight children. Shirley (Pettigrew), Joan (Roberts), Marilyn (Wheeliker), Robert, David, Donald, Clarence, and Kenneth. They began their wedded life purchasing the Bradbury farm on Big Glace Bay Lake. They moved on to a farm property at Sand Lake and then, in December 1945, purchased the Marconi property (including the radio station VAS, Voice of the Atlantic Seaboard) a few miles out of Glace Bay, NS where they raised their family and resided until he passed in 1985 and she in 1989."

He represented Northumberland West in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Conservative member from 1883 to 1886. He was born near Cobourg in Upper Canada, the son of John Mulholland, an Irish immigrant, and studied at the Commercial College in Oswego, New York. He worked for a merchant in Baltimore for three years and was then given charge of a general store in Roseneath in Northumberland County owned by the same merchant. He also served as postmaster for Rosemeath. In 1857, with Alexander Kennedy, he purchased a general store in the nearby town of Alderville. In 1859, he married Mary Kennedy, his partner's sister. Around 1865, that business was sold and Mulholland moved to Cobourg where he opened a hardware and grocery store with Peter Brown. He also established a dry good business in partnership with William Graham. Mulholland served on the Cobourg town council. He died in February 1917 at Clifton Springs, New York. His son Robert Alexander managed a branch of the firm Mulholland & Brown in Port Hope and later served in the Canadian Senate."

It is in this latter capacity that he is best known. Taylor served in the Alaska Legislature from 1985 to 2003. Running for governor of Alaska in 1998 in a blanket primary, Taylor was outpolled by John Lindauer for the Republican nomination. When questions arose over the source of Lindauer's campaign monies, Taylor reemerged as a write-in candidate for the office backed by the Republican Party of Alaska, who had disowned Lindauer. While Taylor outpolled Lindauer in the general election, both candidacies fell far behind that of incumbent Tony Knowles, who was elected to a second term."

  "text" : "Robert Hugh Carlin (February 10, 1901 – October 22, 1991) was a Canadian labour union organizer and politician, who represented the electoral district of Sudbury in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1943 to 1948. He was a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section) (CCF). Born in Buckingham, Quebec in 1901, Carlin moved to Cobalt in 1916 to work in the silver mines. He joined the Western Federation of Miners as a union representative, and was involved in the 1919 Cobalt Miners' Strike. He later began working at Teck Hughes in Kirkland Lake, but was fired in 1940 along with 36 other miners. He remained active as a union organizer, coordinating a major Labour Day demonstration against Teck Hughes in 1941. He subsequently moved to Sudbury, where he became president of Mine Mill Local 598, and won election to the Legislative Assembly in the 1943 election and was re-elected in the 1945 election. Following the 1945 election, the leadership of the CCF launched a purge of suspected Communists within the party and its supporters in the trade union movement attempted to eliminate suspected Communist influence in the union movement targeting, in particular, Mine Mill. National CCF secretary David Lewis and Charles Millard of the Canadian Congress of Labour decided to root the communists out of organized labour's decision-making bodies. Their first target was the CCF riding association in Sudbury, and its affiliated Mine Mill Local 598, even though the local was not under Communist control: out of 11,000 dues-paying members, very few were communists (less than 100). Over the next twenty years, a fierce battle was waged to take over Local 598 by Millard's United Steel Workers of America. Steel won. Carlin was loyal to his union, Local 598, putting him in conflict with CCF establishment in both Toronto and Ottawa. Charles Millard, Ontario CCF leader Ted Jolliffe, and David Lewis did not directly accuse Carlin of being a communist. Instead, they attacked him for not dealing with the perceived problem of communists in the Sudbury Mine Mill local. Local 598 was built by both Communists and CCFers, with the CCFers firmly in control of the executive. Carlin's first loyalty was to the men and women who helped build Local 598, regardless of their political affiliation. This is what got him in trouble with Lewis and Jolliffe. So Lewis and Jolliffe made the case to expel him from the Ontario CCF caucus at a special meeting of the CCF executive and the legislative caucus in Toronto on April 13, 1948. In essence, Carlin became a casualty of Steel's plans to raid Mine, Mill. The CCF lost the seat in the 1948 Ontario election, placing fourth to Welland Gemmell of the Progressive Conservatives. Carlin, running as an independent, finished a very close second. It wasn't until the CCF changed its name to the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Mine Mill/Steelworkers war was over in 1967, that another social democratic candidate — Elie Martel in Sudbury East — was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from the city. Carlin then stood as a Farmer-Labour candidate in the 1949 federal election in the federal riding of Sudbury, losing to Liberal candidate Léoda Gauthier but placing ahead of Willard Evoy, the CCF candidate. He subsequently returned to labour organizing in Sudbury, becoming a bargaining agent for the Steelworkers Local 6500 from 1962 until his retirement. On May 27, 1978, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws degree by Laurentian University. The degree was awarded for his pioneering work in the early days of the union movement in Northern Ontario. Carlin died in Sudbury at the age of 90."

Boyle was the fourth son of Edmund Boyle, 8th Earl of Cork, and his wife Isabella Henrietta (née Poyntz). He served with the Coldstream Guards and achieved the rank of Colonel. At the 1847 general election he was elected unopposed as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Frome. Boyle was returned unopposed in 1852, but that election was later voided after an electoral petition, because Boyle's position as Secretary of the Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick election was held to be an office of profit under the crown. He was re-elected unopposed at the resulting by-election in March 1853, and held his seat in the House of Commons until his death the following year, aged 45. Serving in the Crimean War, Boyle died of fever in Varna, and was buried at sea. He married Georgiana, daughter of Abraham Wildey Robarts, in 1844. They had one son and two daughters. Boyle died in September 1854, aged 45, and was succeeded as Member of Parliament for Frome by his nephew Viscount Dungarvan. His wife survived him by almost 60 years and died in 1911."

  "text" : "Roger Amidon (or Amadon, Amidown, Amadowne) was an early settler of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Roger Amidon was a French Huguenot, who had arrived with John Endecott's advance company after escaping to England from the Siege of La Rochelle in 1628. Roger was a ship's carpenter. He is first recorded at Salem, Massachusetts, where there was a flourishing shipbuilding industry in the early 17th century. On 25 December 1637 at a town meeting it was agreed that the marsh and meadow land in Salem which had been common land was to be \"proportioned out unto [the inhabitants of Salem] accordingly to heads of their families -- to those that have the greatest number an acre thereof and to those that have least not above half an acre and to those that are betweene both three quarters of an acre\". Roger was 89th on the list and drew half an acre of meadow land. He was the only person in his household—see History of Salem. He was probably married around 1639 and moved to Weymouth where his daughter Sarah was baptised in 1640. Three years later the baptism of his daughter Lydia was recorded in Boston. He had at least two more children around this time, but their birth records have yet to be found. He got into some trouble in Boston and on 5 January 1644 he \"was enjoined to pay 2 shillings and 6 pence fees, admonished and discharged\". Not long afterwards he moved to Rehoboth (Seekonk) where in July 1648 he drew a house lot. The houses formed a semicircle around the commons and Roger's home was located at the northeastern end of the circle—see Early Rehoboth by Bowen. His last child by his wife Sarah was baptised in Rehoboth in 1652. In 1658 he took the Oath of Fidelity at Rehoboth and at a town meeting held on 22 June 1658 he participated in the drawing of meadow lots, lying on the north side of the town. The lots were drawn \"according to person and estate\". Roger was number 43 in a list of 49 men drawing lots—see Rehoboth Town Records. Until 1685 Plymouth Colony included the western portion of Rhode Island and for a time Roger lived in Warwick [see Land Records, A:254], which would become part of Kent County, Rhode Island. In 1659 he was sued for neglect in Warwick by Robert Hearngton who was master of the \"Barke Deborn\"—see Early Records of the Town of Warwick. Roger was one of the jurors impanneled at an inquest held at Rehoboth in 1661. That year Rehoboth acquired additional land from the Indians, which would become known as the North Purchase. It contained part of the 50 acres (200,000 m2) that Rehoboth had already granted Roger. His first wife Sarah died in 1668. Within months he remarried and over the next four years became the father of three more children. He died suddenly in 1673 and, due to some suspicion that he had been murdered by his wife, a coroners inquest was held on 11 November 1673. The jury found his death had been a natural one. Roger died intestate and his land was divided between his widow and surviving children: He was one of the early settlers of Rehoboth, and the present city of Attleboro is partially on land purchased from Amidon."

In May 1636, Risley left Massachusetts with almost the entire company he had arrived with two and a half years earlier. They found John Winthrop to be too dictatorial. The group headed west through the wilderness, and after a month stopped in an area now occupied by the city of Hartford, Connecticut. Within the year, the group started a collective government to fight the Pequot War. By the next year, they had adopted what is now generally considered the first written constitution in Western history, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. The group eventually signed a treaty with the Indians for a tract of land and settled down. The present-day state capitol building in Hartford sits on the original Risley land grant. Risley died at Hockanum, Connecticut of typhoid in October 1648, leaving his wife and three children, ages two months to eight years."

  "text" : "Robert Climie (4 January 1868 – 3 October 1929) was a Scottish trade unionist and Labour Party (UK) politician. Robert was born in Kilmarnock, Scotland on 4 January 1868. He was the son of bonnet weaver Mary McGarvie and underground colliery fireman, Robert Climie. He was educated at the local Board School and served his apprenticeship in engineering at the Britannia Works, where he continued to work as an journeyman. Early in his career he became involved in trade union activity and joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Despite previously being a Volunteer Sergeant in the Royal Scots Fusiliers, when he became involved in socialist politics he opposed the Boer War and spoke out regularly against it at the ILP's outdoor meetings from 1899 - 1902. He was first elected as a local councillor for the ILP in 1905 and served for many years, with particular interest in public health and housing. As a nominee of Ayrshire Trades Council, he was a member of the Scottish Trades Union Congress’s Parliamentary Committee from 1910 to 1918 and from 1920 to 1923, and was Secretary to the Committee in 1914. He was elected to Parliament at the 1923 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Kilmarnock, having unsuccessfully contested the seat in 1922. He was narrowly defeated at the 1924 general election, but won the seat back again at the general election in May 1929. However, he was already in poor health by this time and he died in office later that year, aged 61. He was survived by his wife, Jeannie McIldowie Meikle, herself an active Labour Party worker, six sons and a daughter. He was an excellent speaker and formidable debater. In an obituary in the Kilmarnock Standard, 1929, he is described as... ...a small man of medium build, with dark hair and moustache, blue eyes and a fresh complexion. He was moderate in all things, always hard-working in the labour cause and a lifelong supporter of Ramsay MacDonald. Climie was teetotal although never formally attached to the temperance movement. In Kilmarnock, Scotland there is a street, \"Climie Place\" named in his memory."

Gilliam graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1823, in the same class with future state Treasurer Daniel W. Courts, future Chief Justice Richmond M. Pearson, and others. He then began practicing law. Gilliam was also a member of the 1835 convention that thoroughly revised the North Carolina Constitution. Gilliam was elected to represent Granville County in the North Carolina House of Commons in 1836, 1838, 1840, 1846, 1848 and 1862. For much of his time in the House, he served as speaker of the house. In 1863, he was elevated to the state superior court bench. In 1870, Gilliam was elected to the United States House of Representatives in a special election (following the resignation of John T. Deweese), but before he could take his seat, he died. John H. Wheeler wrote of Gilliam, \"As a statesman, he was a pure and patriotic; as a lawyer, he was learned and able, and his ability was only equalled by the kindly qualities of his heart. Such were the conspicuous traits of his character, which endeared him to all who knew him.\""

He was re-elected in the newly established Guysborough-Sheet Harbour riding in the 2003 election. When Rodney MacDonald took over as premier in February 2006, Chisholm was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia, as Minister of Agriculture, and Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. He was re-elected in 2006, and retained the fisheries and aquaculture portfolio in a post-election cabinet shuffle. Chisholm was defeated when he ran for re-election in 2009, losing to New Democrat Jim Boudreau by more than 1800 votes."

  "text" : "Richard Andrews (1798–1859) was a prominent industrialist, philanthropist and politician in Southampton. Richard Andrews was born the son of a wheelwright at Bishop's Sutton. He founded his own coachbuilding business, with a manufacturing site in Above Bar. He was well-known and respected for his work for the city, and was elected mayor in 1849, for three consecutive years. East (Andrews) Park in Southampton is named after him, and features his statue. The original statue, erected in 1860, was a much grander affair, but the limestone weathered poorly, and the pedestal was replaced in 1971. The full text on the plaque on his statue reads: Born the son of a wheelwright at Bishop's Sutton, Hampshire he became a coachbuilder of international fame. His manufactory in above Bar was one of the town's leading industries. Five times Mayor of Southampton he was known for his generosity and energy in furthering the prosperity of the town. A good employer, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to promoting the self-reliance of the working man. This statue was erected in 1860 and the pedestal reconstructed in 1971."

Barran was the son of John Barran, a pioneer in clothing manufacture. Rowland Barran became chairman of the family firm in 1918, succeeding his brother Charles Barran who succeeded their father in this post in 1903. During the course of the war Barran indicated that he wished to stand down at the next election, probably to concentrate more on his business interests as in 1918 he became chairman of the family firm of clothing manufacturers, taking over that position from his brother."

Following the end of the American Revolutionary War, his family was evacuated to what became the Province of New Brunswick in 1783. They first settled at Kingston, New Brunswick but later moved to Woodstock. Around 1795, Ketchum married Charlotte Upham. He was defeated by Jedediah Slason in the 1827 election but declared the winner after an appeal. Slason defeated Ketchum in 1830. In 1832, he donated land for a court house and jail so that Upper Woodstock could become the county town for the newly formed Carleton County. Ketchum was a lieutenant colonel in the local militia. He also served as a judge in the Court of Common Pleas for Carleton County. He died in Woodstock at the age of 73. His daughter Sarah married Charles Peters Wetmore, clerk for the assembly. Their son Edward Ludlow Wetmore later served in the province's legislative assembly and became the first Chief Justice for the province of Saskatchewan."

Davies was born in Llangennech, Carmarthenshire, Wales, the son of Rhys and Ann Davies. After an elementary education he initially worked as a farm labourer. He subsequently moved to the Rhondda Valley, where he worked as a coalminer for ten years. From an early age he was involved in the local co-operative society and became a union official organising shop-assistants throughout South Wales. This led to his moving to Manchester, to take up a post with the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees and later the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers. He was a member of Manchester City Council for thirty years, and also president of the Manchester and Salford Trades Council and of the Withington Divisional Parliamentary Labour Party. In 1921 W T Wilson, Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Westhoughton, died, and Davies was elected at a by-election to succeed him. He served in the first Labour Government in 1924 as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. This was the only government office he held. He retained the Westhoughton seat through successive elections until he retired from the House of Commons early in 1951 due to ill health. At the time he was the longest-serving Labour MP.Davies was a strong supporter of the temperance and pacifist movements, whose causes he advocated in Parliament and in the country. He was also a committed parliamentarian, and served as joint secretary of the British group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He married Margaret Griffiths in 1902, and they had three sons. R J Davies died at his home in Porthcawl, Glamorgan, in 1954, aged 77."

  "text" : "Richard Rigg (1877 – 29 August 1942) was a British Liberal Party politician who defected to the Conservatives. Born in Kendal, Cumberland, Rigg was elected at the 1900 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Appleby division of Westmorland. Aged only 23, his majority of 11% was a surprise, since Appleby had returned only Conservatives since 1885. However, Rigg resigned from the Liberal party in November 1904 because he found himself in agreement with the Conservative government on so many key issues. The Liberals then selected Leif Jones as their candidate for the imminent by-election, and although campaigning began before Christmas, there was as yet no vacancy. Rigg claimed that the \"ruffianism\" of Liberals angry at his defection of the party had made him ill, and he went to an unnamed continental health resort to recover. He returned to England in February 1905, and resigned his seat 11 February 1905 by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead, telling the annual dinner of the Carlisle Conservative Club \"I am proud to be one of you now ... I have the satisfaction of feeling that what I have done was conscientious and right.\" At the resulting by-election on 2 March 1905, Jones held the seat, though with a reduced majority. Rigg subsequently served as a councillor on Westminster City Council, representing Great Marlborough ward from February 1924 to November 1925, and St Margaret ward from February 1930 until his death. He was elected Mayor of Westminster for 1939–40. He was a member of the Municipal Reform Party, the local government wing of the Conservatives. He died at Hove, East Sussex in 1942, aged 65."

  "text" : "Robert Leake (1824 – 1 May 1901) was a British Liberal politician. Leake was the eldest son of Robert Leake of Manchester and Mary Lockett of Salford, Lancashire. After a private education he became head of Lockett, Leake and Company, engravers to calico printers. Leake became involved in Liberal politics in Manchester in the 1860s, and was over time president of the Manchester Liberal Association, the Manchester Reform Club and the Liberal Association of Salford. However, he declined to be a parliamentary candidate until the 1880 general election. In that year he was elected as member of parliament for the two-seat South East Lancashire Division, along with his cousin William Agnew. The Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 divided the South East Lancashire seat into eight single-member constituencies. Leake was elected as the first MP for the new South East Lancashire, Radcliffe cum Farnworth Division. He was reelected in 1886 and 1892. Prior to the 1895 general election, Leake announced his decision to resign. Leake made his residence at \"The Dales\", Whitefield, near Manchester. He was married twice."

He was an Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 2008 to 2015, representing the electorate of Lakemba. Furolo was born in Sydney, and grew up in its outer western suburbs. He worked in the transport industry after leaving school, working as a McDonalds manager for a period, before returning to university to study economics and industrial relations. He was appointed as an advisor to his local MLA, member for Hurstville and future Premier Morris Iemma in 1994. He worked for Iemma for nine years, remaining on his staff after his appointment as a minister in 1999, before leaving to work as a public relations consultant in 2003. Furolo was elected to the City of Canterbury council in 1999, and served a stint as its deputy mayor before standing for mayor in the 2004 election. He won that election, and was re-elected in 2008, recording one of the few swings to the Labor Party in an election where the party faced widespread losses across the state. One week before his re-election as mayor, on 5 September 2008, Iemma resigned as Premier, resulting in widespread speculation that he would resign as the member for Lakemba. After delaying an announcement for two weeks, Iemma announced on 19 September that he would indeed retire; a move reportedly attributed to his efforts to see Furolo, his preferred choice, endorsed as his successor. Furolo subsequently won Labor preselection for what had been Labor's safest seat in the state, and easily won the seat, polling more than 58% of the primary vote, despite a 15-point swing against Labor. He was sworn in as a member of the Legislative Assembly on 18 October, and as a member of the Legislative Review Committee on 30 October. In October 2010, Furolo borrowed a Lamborghini (reportedly valued at $400,000) from local businessmen, \"the Kazzi brothers\", for the purposes of a \"joyride\". Furolo slightly damaged the vehicle but was unhurt. No other vehicles were involved in the accident and no one was hurt."

  "text" : "Rajinder Singh \"Raj\" Pannu (born January 12, 1934) is a Canadian educator and politician, who led the Alberta New Democratic Party from 2000 to 2004. Pannu was born in Punjab, India completing an undergraduate degree before immigrating to Canada in 1962. He settled in Whitecourt, Alberta, where he worked as a high school teacher until 1964. In 1964 he moved to Edmonton to work on a graduate program, completing a Ph.D. in sociology in 1973. He taught at York University for one year (1968–69) before returning to the University of Alberta, where he taught for 27 years until his retirement in 1996. He is Professor Emeritus at the University of Alberta. He entered provincial politics in 1997 when he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the riding of Edmonton-Strathcona. Raj became leader in February 2000 after the previous leader, Pam Barrett, retired from politics. Pannu ran a high-profile campaign in the 2001 Alberta election. T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan \"Raj Against the Machine\", as well as a reputation as a \"likeable and honest politician\" contributed to his popularity and made him a leader well respected by supporters and non-supporters alike. He announced on July 13, 2004 that he was resigning as party leader. Fellow MLA Brian Mason, the deputy leader, became interim leader. Mason was formally elected leader in a leadership convention held on September 18. However, he sought re-election as an MLA in the 26th Alberta general election, and was re-elected by a wide margin. On June 14, 2006, he announced his retirement from Alberta politics at the dissolution of the legislature, which took place in February 2008."

Following the Treaty of Versailles, Waugh became a member of the commission which oversaw the Saarland region while its coal resources were shipped to France.

In 2011, Brad Hazzard NSW Minister for Planning appointed Dyer as a Joint Chair of a Review of the NSW Planning System together with former NSW Environment Minister Tim Moore. In December 2011, he and Mr Moore released an Issues Paper based on an extensive, statewide community and stakeholder consultation process. After consideration of the more than 600 submissions to the Issues Paper (and earlier submissions), Volume 1 (Major Issues) and Volume 2 (Other Issues) of their Review Paper with recommendations for a new planning system in NSW were prepared and provided to the Minister for Planning and Infrastructure. On Saturday 14 July 2012 the Minister released Mr Moore and Mr Dyer's Review Report, The Way Ahead for Planning in NSW Volume 1 (Major Issues) and Volume 2 (Other Issues), together with the Government's initial response to the Review, A New Planning System for NSW – Green Paper. The release of these papers marks the end of their work on the Review."

  "text" : "Raymond Alexander \"Ray\" Stevens (born 1 February 1953) is an Australian politician who is the Leader of Opposition Business in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. Born in Townsville, Stevens is married with two children. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Finance and Economics from James Cook University and Macquarie University, and was admitted to the Australian Association of Accountants in 1974, being employed by Price Waterhouse in Sydney. He returned to the family station, \"Doncaster\" in Richmond, before moving to the Gold Coast in 1979. He ran local businesses in the area and was a councillor on Albert Shire Council from 1988 to 1994, serving as Mayor in 1994. After the amalgamation of Albert and Gold Coast, he was mayor of the latter from 1995 to 1997. Stevens, as member of the Liberal Party, was elected to state parliament in 2006 as the member for Robina, succeeding former state Liberal leader Bob Quinn. At this time he was also appointed as the Shadow Minister for Public Works and Housing from 2006–2009, with a brief stint from 2007–2008 as the Shadow Minister for Information and Communication Technology. In 2008, Stevens joined the new Liberal National Party with the rest of his party. The redistribution ahead of the 2009 state election renamed his seat to Mermaid Beach; he was re-elected. And from 2009–2010 he was the Shadow Minister for Tourism and Fair trading, before he continued in that role as the Shadow Minister for Tourism and Racing from 2010–2011. From early 2011 until the election in 2012 Stevens was the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Racing. With the Liberal National Party winning the 2012 Election, Stevens became the Leader of the House of Queensland and in October 2012 the Assistant Minister to the Premier on e-government. On 11 September 2012, Stevens sparked racism claims after using the term \"Jihad Jackie\" in Parliament to describe opposition spokeswoman Jackie Trad (herself of Catholic-Lebanese heritage). While Stevens withdrew the remark in Parliament upon urging by house speaker, he staunchly maintained using the word Jihad to describe someone of Arabic heritage, on 11 September, was nothing he needed to apologise for. He subsequently said Trad needed to \"harden up\" and had a \"glass jaw\". At a pre-polling booth on 21 January 2015, Stevens was filmed having a bizarre reaction to a journalist asking him questions about a $100 million sky rail project from Mudgeeraba to Springbrook. Stevens had previously stated he had approval from the Integrity Commissioner, but when the journalist asked Stevens for the Commissioner's advice to be released, Stevens refused to answer. When the journalist did not back down and asked how much he could make from the development, Mr Stevens then began to wave his hands and arms up and down in the journalist's face. \"That Mermaid Ray really lost the plot, but without saying a word,\" Donovan said.\"He started doing a dance and gyrating around — this is a Minister of the Crown, we're talking about, let me remind you.\""

Wynne was born in Canterbury, England, being baptized there on December 22, 1622. His grandfather, also Robert Wynne, had been mayor of Canterbury in 1599, and other relatives had served in Parliament. He settled in Charles City County, Virginia in early 1656, though he may have arrived in Virginia earlier. He served on the county court, though he was fined for poor attendance in September 1659. He also did not serve as a burgess in that year's assembly, though he did the years before and after. The House of Burgesses called by Sir William Berkeley in 1661 continued without dissolving until 1676, meeting in seventeen sessions during that period. At the second session in 1662, Wynne was elected as Speaker to replace Henry Soane, who had died during the recess. Under Wynne's leadership, the House took an active role in business previously left to the Governor and Council, creating a standing committee to advise the Governor between sessions. Wynne died in 1675; his will was dated July 1."

  "text" : "Sara Rosalie Wahl (née Erwin; August 27, 1924 – July 22, 2013) was an American lawyer and judge from Minnesota. She was the first woman in state history named to the Minnesota Supreme Court. Born in Caney, Kansas, Wahl earned her undergraduate degree from the University of Kansas in 1946. She received her law degree from William Mitchell College of Law two decades later, in 1967. From 1967 to 1973, she worked as an Assistant State Public Defender. In 1977, she became the first woman to serve on the Minnesota Supreme Court, having been appointed by Governor Rudy Perpich. She served on the court until her retirement in 1994. Wahl died on July 22, 2013 at the age of 88. Supreme Court Chief Justice Lorie Gildea issued a statement on the death of former Justice Wahl: \"Rosalie Wahl was a trailblazer for our state, both as a lawyer and as the first woman to serve on the Minnesota Supreme Court. While on the court she led efforts to address both gender fairness and racial bias in our state’s justice system. She will be remembered with fondness and respect for her unwavering commitment to the principle of equal justice for all.\" In an interview with Peter Shea done in 2003 she talks about her post-retirement role as a \"public citizen,\" including her work as a peace activist. Wahl also served as an adjunct professor at William Mitchell College of Law and the University of Minnesota Law School. There is a book about Wahl, titled Her Honor: Rosalie Wahl and the Minnesota Women's Movement, which was published in 2014."

This has been gossip within the CLP since May 2011, after he angered several of his colleagues by publicly supporting the distribution of condoms at a Darwin music festival. Nonetheless, he was surprised when he lost his preselection. CLP Party President Sue Fraser-Adams, was quoted in a newspaper article that \"politics doesn't suit him, it's a lot harder than it looks\"  she went on to say that it was a safe seat for the party.

  "text" : "Rob Howard (born 1954 or 1955) is a Canadian politician who was elected to the 39th Parliament of British Columbia as the Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from the riding of Richmond Centre. A member of the BC Liberal Party, he replaced retiring BC Liberal Olga Ilich in that riding, by winning the riding in the 2009 provincial election. While his party formed a majority government, Howard was not included in Gordon Campbell's cabinet but was appointed to several committees, including the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts in the first two sessions, and Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services in the third and fourth session. Howard introduced one piece of legislation, the Trustee Board of the Church of God, Richmond Municipality, B.C. (Corporate Restoration) Act, 2009 (Pr 402), to retroactively restore that organization's corporate status. As chair of the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services, Howard supported Premier Campbell's efforts at establishing the Harmonized Sales Tax. Following Campbell's resignation, Howard endorsed Kevin Falcon but Christy Clark won the leadership election. Clark eventually made Howard a Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Transportation. In this position he advocated for Open Sky agreements and continued this advocacy in his post-political life by establishing the non-profit organization OpenSkies4Canada. Howard did not seek re-election during the 2013 provincial election and was replaced by BC Liberal Teresa Wat. Prior to his election to the legislature, Howard worked in property management. He served as a City Councillor in the Richmond, British Columbia for seven years. He was first elected to the Richmond, British Columbia City Council in the October 2001 by-election as a member of the Richmond Non-Partisan Association and was re-elected in the November 2002 and 2005 civic elections as a member of the Richmond First Party. He sat on council as an independent starting in 2006. While on council he advocated in favour of casino expansion, locating the Olympic speed-skating oval in Richmond, and developing a convention centre."

Martyn believes that it was originally a nickname, and may well have denoted a person of Anglo-Saxon, rather than Norman, descent. If so, this would make the Skerrets one of only two families of English origin among the Tribes. His presumptive descendants include"

  "text" : "Richard Davies (29 November 1818 – 27 October 1896) was a Welsh businessman and ship-owner and nonconformist Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1868 to 1886. Davies was born at Llangefni, Anglesey, the son of Richard Davies, a merchant of Llangefni, and his wife Anne Jones of Coed Hywel. He was educated at Llangefni national school. When his father set up subsidiary businesses under the management of his three sons, Richard Davies was assigned to the old ferry-terminal of Porthaethwy, which was reconstituted as Menai Bridge. This timber importing business developed so successfully that all the family became involved and the business developed into large-scale ship-owning which generated considerable wealth, based to a large extent on guano.His brother, Robert, was renowned as a philanthropist. Davies became a notable figure in politics as a Welsh radical nonconformist. He stood as Liberal candidate for Caernarvon at the 1852 general election but lost by 93 votes. Davies was Anglesey's first Nonconformist J.P. and was High Sheriff of Anglesey in 1858. He was elected unopposed as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Anglesey in the election of 1868. He retained the seat till the 1886 general election, when he retired, being opposed to the proposal for Irish Home Rule. At one time Davies lived at Bwlch-y-fen, but afterwards at Treborth, opposite Menai Bridge and was a benefactor to Bangor Normal College and to the ‘British’ schools. He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Anglesey in 1884. Davies died at Treborth at the age of 77 and was buried in Llandysilio churchyard. Famously his final words are reputed to be \"cannot be fathomed\". A memorial to him is in the Menai Bridge English Presbyterian Church alongside memorials to other members of the family. ..(The Davies' family was closely associated with this church, it having been built at Robert's expense.) Davies married Anne Rees, daughter of Rev. Henry Rees of Liverpool and niece of William Rees in 1855 and had several children, one of whom was Henry Rees Davies."

Pullar was born at Perth in February 1828, eldest of nine children of John Pullar (1803-1878), a dyer, and his wife Mary Walker. He was educated in Perth at Stewart's Academy in Atholl Street, Greig's Academy in Stormont Street, and at Perth Academy, also doing continuation classes in French and German. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1880 and in 1905 he received an honorary D.C.L. from St Andrew's University. He was apprenticed under his father in 1841, a junior partner in 1848 and ultimately senior partner in the local family firm of Pullars Dyeworks, a firm which also branched into dry cleaning, a technique he learned from Germany, establishing a plant in Tulloch in 1882. He was known as an extensive and generous donor to local charities and other local causes and a benevolent employer, although in the last year of his life there was a major strike in the firm when he refused to discuss wage rises. He was a J.P. for the County of Perth. He was knighted in 1895. He travelled widely in Russia, Scandinavia, America and the Middle East. He was elected unopposed at a by-election on 12 February 1907 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Perth, but stood down in January 1910.At the time of his election, he was six days short of his 79th birthday, making his possibly the oldest parliamentary debut of an MP in the 20th century. He rarely spoke in debates and was criticized by local trade unions for failing to support measures to help the unemployed. He married in 1859 Helen Mary, daughter of Charles Daniell of Wantage, Berkshire, England, by whom he had two sons. She died in 1904 and he, aged 84, in September 1912 after a seizure. He was buried at Wellshill Cemetery, Perth."

The tusks belong to the Zimbabwean Government.\" In September 2014, during a debate in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on a bill to change the franchise for elections for the Sydney City Council, former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell criticised Borsak as \"curious, even bizarre\", and claimed that his record in the upper house represented \"an utter failure to deliver any meaningful reform during this parliament to the people he allegedly represents.\" In mid-January 2016 it was reported that New South Wales Member of Parliament Mr Robert Borsak MLC had been recently charged (by the Department of Public Prosecutions) with several counts of perjury.

Representative Terrill is a key figure in the 2010 Oklahoma political corruption investigation. On November 4, 2011, a judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to warrant a trial of Terrill for bribery. Terrill was found guilty of bribery in connection with the 2010 Oklahoma political corruption investigation concerning the Office of the Oklahoma Chief Medical Examiner in which he bribed State Senator Debbe Leftwich (D-Oklahoma City) to give up her seat so State Representative Mike Christian (R-Oklahoma City) could run for it instead. On October 29, 2013, a jury convicted Terrill of bribery and recommended he receive a sentence of one year in prison and a $5,000 fine. Christian and Leftwich were not charged."

  "text" : "Robert Cunningham Bruce (1843 – 23 April 1917) was a Scottish-born sailor, New Zealand politician and conservationist. Born in East Lothian, Scotland, Bruce's family moved to County Cork, Ireland, when he was seven years of age. He became an apprentice sailor at 13, leaving London on an East Indiaman. He eventually arrived in New Zealand on the Blue Jacket in 1860. After working in the goldfields of New Zealand and Queensland, he went to the United States where he remained for several years. In 1877 he returned to New Zealand, buying land in Paraekaretu in the Manawatu region. Bruce was an independent conservative Member of Parliament in the Manawatu region of New Zealand. He represented the Rangitikei electorate from 1884 to 1890. He contested the 1890 election in the Waitotara electorate, but was beaten by the incumbent, George Hutchison. The Rangitiki electorate, meanwhile, was won by Douglas Hastings Macarthur in 1890, but Macarthur died on 24 May 1892. The resulting 1892 by-election was won by Bruce. He served until the end of the parliamentary term in 1893 when he retired. He was one of three candidates to contest the new Manawatu electorate in the 1896 election, but he was narrowly beaten by John Stevens. He challenged Stevens again in the 1899 election but was again defeated. Bruce was a notable pioneer of the Manawatu District, who preserved several native forest remnants, including Bruce Park Scenic Reserve. Late in his life, he wrote a book about his experiences at sea. He died at his homestead Carrick in the Wanganui suburb of St. Johns Hill on 23 April 1917."

  "text" : "Sir Richard Nagle (1636 – 6 April 1699) was an Irish politician and lawyer. He held the positions of Attorney-General for Ireland, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, Lord Justice of Ireland and Secretary of State and War for Ireland under King James II. He fled to France in 1691, joining James II at Saint Germain, where he resumed his duties as nominal Secretary of State and War. He later served as Commissioner of the Household. Richard was born into an Old English family at Carrigacunna Castle, in County Cork, the son of James Nagle of Annakissy, and James' wife, Honora Nugent. This was his family's seat. His brother Pierce was a future High Sheriff of Cork. Although Richard was initially destined to join the clergy, he was educated in law at Gray's Inn and was called to the bar in Dublin. \"Active and skillful\", he had a successful career as a lawyer. The Earl of Tyrconnell brought Richard to England with him in 1685 to meet James II. James created him Attorney-General for Ireland and knighted him in 1686. He also appointed him to the Privy Council of Ireland. As an MP for Cork, Nagle was elected Speaker by the Irish House of Commons in 1689. This parliament is known to posterity as the \"Patriot Parliament\". It spurned the outcome of the Glorious Revolution, recognising King James's divine right to the Irish crown over William of Orange's parliamentary one. William, made King of England during the revolution, was set on conquering Ireland from James, and to achieve that end he launched the Williamite War. Richard was diametrically opposed to the Act of Settlement 1662 (he was the author of A Letter from Coventry, an anti-settlement pamphlet), which had punished royalists and Catholics who had fought against parliament in the Civil Wars; he unsuccessfully advocated its repeal in this session. James's forces were routed by William's at the Battle of the Boyne, in 1690; King James retreated to Dublin. It was here he convened a council that advised him to flee to France. Nagle was one of its members. They reasoned that if he did not leave \"he would run a great risk of being taken by the enemy\". James followed their advice. Nagle, accompanied by Tyrconnell, visited him at his court-in-exile, Saint Germain, at the end of 1690. In Nagle's absence, his duties as Secretary of State were executed by the Baron Nugent of Riverston. Upon the death of Tyrconnell, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Nagle became one of the Lords Justice of Ireland. The others were Francis Plowden and Baron Fitton of Gawsworth. They administered what remained of Jacobite Ireland in the place of the Lord Lieutenant, though they did not assume command of the armed forces. Sir Richard Nagle married Jane (Joan) O'Kearney on September 19, 1669 at Clonbrogan, Ireland. Jane's sister, Mary O'Kearney, married Sir Richard's brother, Pierce Nagle of Annakissy, the high sheriff of County Cork in 1689."

He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He succeeded his father to the baronetcy in 1852, but had to live for several years in France because of his debts from gambling and horse racing (see George Samuel Ford). In December 1861, Clifton was elected at a by-election as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham. He was re-elected at the 1865 general election, but his election was declared void on 20 April 1866. He was re-elected for Nottingham at the 1868 general election but died a year later at the age of 42 from typhoid fever. In 1868 building work began on the Clifton Colliery at Wilford after coal was found on the estate. The colliery opened in 1870 after Clifton's death, as did the Wilford Toll Bridge for which he was also responsible. Clifton married Geraldine Isabella O'Meara, daughter of Colonel John O'Meara, in 1863. They had no children and the baronetcy became extinct upon his death. The Clifton estates went to his cousin's son Henry Robert Markham."

He did not resign when Tuxworth subsequently won a caucus confidence vote, but stepped down when Tuxworth resigned and was replaced as Chief Minister by Stephen Hatton. Elsey was abolished ahead of the 1987 election, and Steele nominated for CLP preselection to contest Katherine, essentially the urbanised portion of his old seat. However, he indicated to the preselection committee that he could not guarantee that he would serve a full term if elected. The Opposition Leader, Terry Smith, publicly suggested that Steele had only renominated because this would increase his superannuation. He was one of three incumbent MLAs at that election to be denied preselection by the party's central council; while Noel Padgham-Purich and Denis Collins were re-elected as independents, Steele retired and publicly campaigned for his endorsed successor, Mike Reed."

He served as general secretary of the Students Union at Giridih College. From 1971 onwards he served as chairman of the Giridih municipality. He owned hundreds of liquor shops across several states, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa. In Giridih, Prasad was seen as a Robin Hood-like figure, known for his philanthropic actions towards the local community. His image was tarnished by a scandal in 1979, after 233 people in Dhanbad District died from liquor poisoning. However, his reputation in Giridih remained solid and he was nominated as the Congress (I) candidate for the Giridih seat in the 1980 Bihar Legislative Assembly election. This was the first time he contested an election to the Legislative Assembly. Randhir Prasad died in a jeep accident on May 16, 1980, just two weeks ahead of the election, at the age of 35. The election in Giridih was countermanded and held in 1981. His widow, Urmila Devi, stood as candidate for the seat. Devi, with no previous political experience, managed to defeat the incumbent veteran Communist Party of India politician Chaturanan Mishra with 55.71% of the votes in the constituency."

  "text" : "Robin Kyle Blencoe (born November 12, 1947) was a politician in British Columbia, Canada. He was elected to represent the riding of Victoria-Hillside in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1983, 1986 and 1991. He served in the Cabinet of Mike Harcourt as Minister of Municipal Affairs, Minister of Government Services and the Minister Responsible for Sport and the Commonwealth Games. He was forced out of office due to a number of sexual harassment complaints, which resulted in Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision on the scope of section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and on the administrative law principle of natural justice. Due to delays to the tribunal hearings the claims were not resolved for 30 months after the first filing in 1995. During this time Blencoe was subjected to vast media coverage that led to the end of his political career, and contributed to his and his family's social and psychological hardship. The Supreme Court of Canada rejected Blencoe's argument that the delay warranted a stay of the human rights complaint. Following this decision, the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal issued its decision on the original sexual harassment complaint. The Tribunal found that Mr. Blencoe had engaged in conduct towards an employee which was sexual in nature and unwelcome, and that this conduct had a negative work-related impact on the employee. The Tribunal issued a declaration that Mr. Blencoe not engage in similar activity in the future an ordered that he pay $5000 to the former employee."

  "text" : "Ronald Arthur Chamberlain (19 April 1901 – 12 May 1987) was a British lecturer, housing consultant and politician. Educated at Owen's School, Islington and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, for many years he was secretary of the National Federation of Housing Societies He joined the Labour Party soon after the First World War. At the 1945 general election he was the party's candidate for the south London suburban constituency of Norwood. The constituency had been held comfortably by the Conservatives since its creation in 1885, but a landslide in favour of Labour saw Chamberlain elected member of parliament, overturning a Conservative majority of 12,456 to win the seat by 2,023 votes. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of Town and Country Planning, Lewis Silkin. Chamberlain was regarded as a \"maverick\" member on the left wing fringe of the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was disciplined after voting against the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949. He also controversially accepted an invitation to visit Francoist Spain, returning with favourable reports on the régime. He narrowly avoided de-selection prior to the 1950 general election. When the election was held he was unseated, with the Conservatives regaining the seat. In 1971 he resigned from the Labour Party over its support for trade unions whose only purpose he claimed was the \"continual forcing up of wage rates, regardless of their less fortunate brothers and sisters and equally regardless of the public interest.\""

He represented Kootenay in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1877 to 1886. He was born in Raphoe, County Donegal, the son of Professor Galbraith, of Scottish descent, and was educated at the Royal College there. In 1870, he came to Fort Steele on the Kootenay River, at that time known as Galbraith's Ferry, to join his brother John who was operating a ferry and general store there.

In 1858, McLeese came to British Columbia, settling at New Westminster. Five years later, he moved to the Cariboo District, settling at Soda Creek. McLeese married Mary McLaren in 1873. He served as postmaster for Soda Creek, the post office being located in his hotel. McLeese ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the assembly in an 1879 by-election held following the death of John Evans. He resigned his seat in the assembly in 1888 to run unsuccessfully for a seat in the Canadian House of Commons. McLeese died in Soda Creek; his death record states his age as 68. McLeese Lake, originally named Mud Lake, was renamed in his honour; the community of the same name was named because of the lake."

He joined the militia and came to Victoria in 1879 to inspect the coastal defences there. Tatlow remained there as instructor to the local militia and custodian for artillery supplies. The following year, he was hired as private secretary to the lieutenant governor, Albert Norton Richards. He continued in the same function for Richards' successor, Clement Francis Cornwall. Tatlow resigned that post in 1886 and moved to Vancouver where he was a real estate, insurance and mining broker. He was a member of the city's park committee from 1888 to 1905 and served as chairman from 1895 to 1903. In 1893, he married Elizabeth Mary Cambie. Tatlow ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1890 and 1894 before being elected in 1900. He introduced a private member's bill requiring all immigrants to be able to write in a European language. Tatlow served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Finance and Agriculture and as Commissioner of Lands and Works. He also served as deputy premier. He resigned his seat in October 1909 after Richard McBride proposed guarantees to help finance the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway. Tatlow died in Victoria at the age of 54 after being ejected from his carriage. Mount Tatlow was named in his honour."

He married Clara Taylor in 1869, with whom he had ten children. In 1873 unwise mining speculations led to his bankruptcy; he was discharged in 1875 and moved to Tatham on the Richmond River in 1880, returning to timber work. From 1884 to 1894 he was an alderman at Casino; he was bankrupted again in 1887 and moved to Casino to become an auctioneer. From 1894 to 1904 he was the member for Richmond in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, associated with the Protectionist and Progressive parties. Despite his opposition to Federation he contested several federal elections as an Independent. Pyers died at Casino in 1915."

His father, a Crown Reeve in Sweden, was accused of embezzlement in 1890 and subsequently adopted the surname Bruhn and went to Canada, leaving his family behind. The family moved to Göteborg, where his mother operated a bakery. In 1894, Rolf left school and worked as a deckhand on freighters. He won a sailboat in a raffle in 1895; he gave most of the money to his mother and bought a ticket to Canada. There, like his father, he adopted the surname Bruhn. Bruhn worked as a sailor on the Great Lakes; moving west, he worked on the railway and as a miner and logger. In 1898, he settled in Malakwa, British Columbia. Bruhn married Anna Treat in 1902. Bruhn supplemented his income from farming with road contract work. In 1910, he moved with his family to Salmon Arm, working as a road foreman and then road superintendent. He also served four years as an alderman. Bruhn lost his position of road superintendent after the Liberals were elected in 1916. He moved to Sicamous, where he established a business producing cedar poles. Bruhn was badly burned in a fire and, for a time, his wife managed the company. The company expanded, building a lumber mill at Canoe and addling logs and railway ties to its products. He was named to the Conservative cabinet as President of the Executive Council in 1928 and as Minister of Public Works in 1930. Bruhn helped draft the platform for the Social Constructive Party in 1937 and, although he ran as an Independent candidate in the 1937 general election, he was endorsed by the Constructives. The Social Constructive Party was not successful and Bruhn ran again as a Conservative in 1941. Later that year, he was again Minister of Public Works in a Liberal/Conservative coalition government. Bruhn suffered a stroke and died in office the following year."

Born in Steinbach, Manitoba, the son of Abraham Loewen, a funeral parlour operator, Loewen completed a degree in theology at Briercrest Bible College in Saskatchewan. When his father became ill, he took over the family business. He married Anne Heinrichs in 1962. In 1969, Loewen and his family moved to British Columbia. At that time, he also became involved in real estate and transportation. After leaving politics, Loewen was involved in real estate for a time. During the mid-1980s, he began acquiring Canadian funeral homes. In 1987, the Loewen Group expanded into the United States. By 1997, the company had 15,000 employees and operated 1,115 funeral homes. In 1995, a funeral home operator in Mississippi won $500 million in damages in a breach of contract suit. The large amount of punitive damages awarded relative to business assets not worth more than $4 million was criticized, but this setback led to a downturn in the company's fortunes. In 1998, Loewen stepped down as CEO and sold his shares in the company. The Loewen Group filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999; in 2002, it was restructured as the Alderwoods Group. In 2008, Loewen's Twin Cedars estate in Burnaby was listed for sale at $25 million (Canadian), and was sold June 2012 for $9.948 million."

Also involved in the militia, he became a professional soldier in 1912 when he joined the New Zealand Military Forces. He was commanding the Auckland Military District at the time of the outbreak of the First World War and was appointed the commander of the Samoa Expeditionary Force, dispatched from New Zealand to occupy the island of Samoa, a territory of Imperial Germany at the time. Samoa was easily occupied on 29 August 1914 and Logan became its Military Administrator; he remained in this capacity for the duration of the war. Although he was decorated for his services, his administration of Samoa was later criticised, particularly in relation to the handling of the influenza outbreak of November 1918, which led to 7,500 deaths. Logan retired from military service in 1919 and settled in Devon, England, where he died in 1935."

In 1939, Richard Beckett joined his father, H.B. Beckett, in the operation of the family funeral home in Brantford. Serving in the Canadian Army Active Service from 1939 to 1946, Richard Beckett retired with the rank of Major and returned to his home town of Brantford where he continued to provide extraordinary leadership in local politics, service groups and committees. Between 1953 and 1970, Richard served 5 years as Alderman and 10 years as Mayor of Brantford (1961-1970). In 1971, Richard became Brant MPP and worked as Parliamentary Assistant to both Minister of Transportation and Communication (March 7, 1974 - January 15, 1975), and the Treasurer and Minister of Economics and Intergovernmental Affairs (January 15, 1975 - January 20, 1976).

He died on March 7, 1983 and he is buried in the Farringdon Burial Ground, Brantford, Ontario."

He was selected from 114 applicants to fill a vacancy on the Council in January 1997, was elected to the position that fall, and was reelected in 2001 and 2005. As of October 2007 he was chair of the Finance & Budget and Budget Committees, vice-chair of the Economic Development & Neighborhoods Committee, and a member of the Housing, Human Services & Health Committee. In his 2001 campaign, he defeated music critic, monorail booster and author Grant Cogswell. In a film about that campaign, Grassroots, McIver was played by Cedric the Entertainer. McIver chaired the City Council’s Housing & Economic Development Committee. He was vice-chair of the Environment, Emergency Management and Utilities Committee and was a member of the Transportation Committee. He was an alternate member of the Energy & Technology Committee. (From 2004 through 2007 he was the chair of the Council’s Budget & Finance Committee.) McIver was strongly identified with Rainier Valley, one of Seattle's poorer neighborhoods. According to at least one obituary, his greatest achievement in office was the creation of a $50 million Rainier Valley Community Development Fund, and he was \"deeply worried\" about Link Light Rail impacting \"immigrant- and minority-owned businesses along Rainier Avenue.\" During the protests surrounding the Seattle World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999, McIver, on his way to an official dinner, was, according to fellow councilmember Jean Godden, \"stopped by a Seattle policeman who did not recognize him as a council member, refused to believe he was a public official, and insisted on making him stand spreadeagled up against his car.\" \"He never forgot that, not so much because of the indignity to him, but that others did not believe an African American might be a city councilmember.\" McIver died on March 9, 2013, at the age of 71 in Seattle."

  "text" : "Raef al-Maarri was an officer in the Syrian Army and a deputy of Colonel Jassem Alwan. Politically aligned with the Nasserists, supporters of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, Maarri and Alwan orchestrated a failed coup attempt against the Ba'athist-dominated government that took power in the coup d'état of 8 March 1963, which toppled the secessionist government of Nazim al-Qudsi and Khalid al-Azm. The latter two themselves gained power after a coup that ended the union with Egypt in the United Arab Republic. The Nasserists were major participants in the 8 March coup, but were increasingly sidelined by the Ba'athists who executed a mass purging of Nasserists and political independents beginning in late April. Maarri and Alwan planned a counter coup against the Ba'athists with the aid of the Arab Nationalist Movement in Syria and Egyptian intelligence. The insurrection was launched on 18 July, but was violently quelled by the security forces led Amin al-Hafiz, the Ba'athist Interior Minister. Several Nasserist officers were arrested and executed in the immediate aftermath, but Maarri managed to flee the authorities and went into hiding in the Ghouta countryside of Damascus with Alwan. After being discovered and apprehended, both were tried by a military court where Maarri plead guilty to his role in the abortive coup, stating it was an attempt to ensure the unification process with Egypt and Iraq would continue in light of the Ba'athists' perceived anti-unionist actions. Maarri was sentenced to death, but the sentence was later reduced to life imprisonment on 10 December. He was released a year later in December 1964 with Alwan and several other alleged participants in the July coup in an amnesty agreement. Afterward, the men were escorted to the border with Lebanon from which they departed for the Egyptian embassy in Beirut to seek asylum in Egypt, which Egypt granted."

He retired from office in 1971 after one term and was succeeded by then-San Jose Vice Mayor Norm Mineta. In 1970, Mayor James submitted a letter addressed to a future mayor, which was placed in a time capsule buried at San Jose's former main library on West San Carlos Street on May 14, 1970. Other artifacts included with James' letter included a copy of the San Jose city charter, a city council agenda from 1969, newspaper clippings, and a taped radio interview with city librarian Geraldine Nurney, which was recorded at the library's dedication in April 1970. James had been told that the time capsule would remain buried for about 100 years, so he assumed he wouldn't live to see it reopened. However, the old main library was demolished in 2011, which allowed for the capsule's recovery. The time capsule was opened in September 2013 and James' letter was reprinted in its entirety in the San Jose Mercury News. James remarked at the ceremony, \"They told me it was going to be opened in 100 years or longer...I was pleasantly surprised that the Mercury News printed the letter verbatim so people could read it. Now, I'm just happy to still be here.\""

Olson is widely credited with spearheading the ongoing redevelopment and rebirth of downtown Des Moines during his tenure as the city's mayor. Downtown Des Moines, the capital and largest city in Iowa, had suffered from neglect and blight by the 1970s. Olson oversaw much of the \"first wave\" of the downtown's redevelopment. He was an early proponent of Des Moines' skywalk. Olson also supported the construction and development of numerous city landmarks, including the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden, Civic Center of Greater Des Moines, the renovation of the riverfront, and Cowles Commons (formerly known as Nollen Plaza). Olson successfully persuaded the city's political and business communities to support his redevelopment efforts, including developer and Iowa Realty founder, Bill Knapp. In 2014, Knapp called Olson \"the spark plug to get things rolling\" for downtown Des Moines."

Defeated by seven votes on election night, the number was reduced to two when official results were announced. However, a judicial recount in September ended with MacNeil being declared the winner by three votes.His Progressive Conservative opponent appealed to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, and in February 1990, the by-election was declared invalid and MacNeil's victory voided. A second by-election was held on August 28, 1990, with MacNeil winning the seat. He was re-elected in the 1993 election, and served as a backbench member of John Savage's government.

He is a member of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party. One of 5 boys, Brothers - Don, was a pilot and shot down in WWII, John Fiske, Fred Fiske, Leon Fiske, (and 2 sisters who died at birth), Fiske was born in Clarence, Nova Scotia and graduated from high school in Annapolis, Nova Scotia. Growing up on a wood mill run by his father, he began his business career working in the bank. Later to become an entrepreneur, businessman, restaurateur, and motel/hotel owner/operator. He married Claire Longley of Bridgetown, Nova Scotia and has three children, Heather, Alan and Shari. Fiske entered provincial politics in the 1970 election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Donald R. MacLeod by 434 votes in Pictou Centre. On October 28, 1970, Fiske was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Provincial Secretary and Minister of Trade and Industry. On July 15, 1971, Gerald Regan shuffled his cabinet, moving Fiske to Minister of Development. He remained as Provincial Secretary until another shuffle in November 1971. Fiske resigned from cabinet prior to an August 1973 cabinet shuffle, and did not seek re-election in 1974. He later served as Chairman of the Nova Scotia Gaming Commission. Although forced to resign due to indiscretions between the Halifax Casino and the government at the time, his claims were found to be truthful. \"When Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation's former chairman Ralph Fiske's wrongful dismissal suit went to trial last May, one canny Halifax lawyer voiced surprise that Fiske planned to call only two witnesses: himself and former finance minister Bill Gillis. Arrayed against him were seventeen members of Nova Scotia's political, bureaucratic, and legal establishment: former premiers, cabinet ministers, and deputy ministers from the premier's office; officials of the gaming corporation; and a clutch of Liberal lawyers from the province's best-connected law firms. Yesterday, Fiske touched home plate in near total victory. Gruchy found that political interference in the gaming corporation's administration of the Sheraton Casino project rendered Fiske's position untenable and forced him to resign. Nova Scotian's should celebrate this moment, rare in our recent history, when a lone civil servant proved that courage and integrity can overcome the mediocrity that corrupts governance in this province. When future civil servants are forced to choose between doing the right thing and the politically easy thing, Fiske's example will beckon them toward duty\""

  "text" : "In 1685, the Lords proprietors commissioned Quary as Provincial Secretary, and on July 12 he was appointed Governor of Carolina, replacing Joseph West. In October Quary was replaced by former Governor Joseph Morton. Suspecting that Quary was using his position to encourage pirates, the proprietors removed him from all remaining positions in February 1688. Seeking a political comeback, Quary supported Seth Sothel's takeover of the Governor's office in 1690, and was appointed Chief Justice. In 1692, Sothel was forced from office, and Quary fled South Carolina for Philadelphia, where he came under the protection of Maryland Gov. Francis Nicholson. The Navigation Act of 1696 created admiralty courts, and Quary was appointed Judge of the Admiralty for the southern colonies, from Pennsylvania southward. In 1701, Robert Quary was commissioned as Surveyor General of the Customs for New Jersey and Pennsylvania; in 1703 this appointment was expanded to include all of British America. In this position he served simultaneously on the Provincial Councils of five colonies: Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Robert Quary died in Virginia in October 1712."
