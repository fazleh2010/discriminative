  "text" : "Kenneth Sweigard (September 21, 1919 – July 11, 2005) was a Pentecostal evangelist from Grande Prairie, Alberta, and politician who led the Social Credit Party of Canada from 1983 to 1986. In the 1980 election, Social Credit's five remaining Members of Parliament (all from Quebec) were defeated. The party had not had any MPs from its old base of Alberta and British Columbia since 1968. Sweigard first ran as a Social Credit candidate in the 1980 federal election. Standing in Peace River, Alberta, he came in fifth place with 462 votes. He placed behind the three major parties and the candidate for the Rhinoceros Party of Canada. Sweigard first sought the party’s leadership in 1982, when he lost to Martin Hattersley. Sweigard attended the party's leadership convention dressed as U.S. president Abraham Lincoln, wearing a top hat and carrying a walking stick. His entourage, dressed in 1860s style, held placards reading \"Free the Slaves\" and chanted \"Free the economic slaves\", a reference to the social credit theory of monetary reform and opposition to the charging of interest on borrowed money. Hattersley resigned as leader in June 1983 when the party would not expel three outspoken party members from Alberta, including Jim Keegstra who had been accused of anti-Semitism. Sweigard, who described Keegstra as a \"fine Christian gentleman\", was elected interim leader by means of a telephone conference call of 17 party members, with 9 votes to 5 votes for party vice-president Richard Lawrence and three for Adrien Lambert. As leader, he ran in the 1984 election in Timiskaming, placing last with 151 votes. Nationally, under his leadership, the party suffered what was, at the time, its worst performance to date receiving only 16,659 votes nationwide. Sweigard attempted to win the leadership on a permanent basis at the party's national convention in 1986 but fared poorly, despite telling delegates that he had been visited by an angel who had endorsed his candidacy. Sweigard received only 9 of 114 votes, finishing well behind winning candidate Harvey Lainson and runner-up Jim Keegstra. After losing the leadership, he ran again in the 1988 election in Peace River, where he came in last in a field of six candidates with 354 votes. He died at Grande Prairie in 2005."

  "text" : "Kris Hanna (born 1962) is an Australian politician, and former member for Mitchell in the South Australian House of Assembly from 1997 until 2010. Originally elected as a member of the Australian Labor Party, Hanna joined the SA Greens in 2003 before becoming an independent member in 2006. Before entering Parliament, Hanna practised law. He also served as a Councillor for the City of Marion from 1995 to 1997. He returned to practicing law in 2010 and, in 2014 was elected unopposed as Mayor of the City of Marion. Hanna is currently on the Board of Victim Support Service, and is Patron of numerous local sporting clubs. He was the longest-serving member of the Seaview High School Governing Council and had been President of Friends of Glenthorne and the Reynella Business & Tourism Association. While initially elected at the 1997 and 2002 elections as a member of the Labor Party, he moved to the Greens in early 2003. He ultimately resigned from the Greens on 8 February 2006 and ran in the 2006 election as an independent and won. His chances of retaining his seat in 2006 had been essentially written off by most commentators after his decision to become an Independent MP, but he won a narrow victory after a very low Liberal primary vote and an endorsement from popular Independent MP Nick Xenophon. He narrowly lost at the 2010 election despite an improved vote, due to finishing third after all non-major party preferences had been distributed. Hanna sought to have his 2010 election loss overturned by the Supreme Court of South Australia, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, saying he fell victim to \"misleading and defamatory\" leaflets and posters distributed by the Labor Party. The court ruled the leaflets - labelling Hanna \"soft on crime\" - were defamatory and not factual, yet there was a right to express such opinions. The court dismissed Hanna's case. Hanna unsuccessfully re-contested the seat of Mitchell at the 2014 election. Some of the local issues Hanna was known to campaign for were: upgrading the Oaklands rail crossing, making Glenthorne a forested recreational park, and turning the old O’Halloran Hill TAFE site into a high school."

He went to school in Toronto and attended North Toronto Collegiate Institute and University of Toronto Schools. He went to the University of Toronto and graduated from the Faculty of Law. He practised with Blake, Cassels & Graydon before starting his own firm in 1968. After several years of practice at Houser Henry Loudon and Syron, Jaffary joined Gowlings in 1992 before continuing his municipal planning law practice as a sole practitioner near the turn of the century. Jaffary was active with the federal New Democratic Party and served as vice-president from 1969 to 1973. Jaffary became active in local politics in 1968 when he became president of the Ward 2 Residents' Association in the Cabbagetown area. The association fought the city's plans to tear down housing for urban renewal. In the 1960s, Cabbagetown was a run down area of town. Since then many of the houses have been renovated and the neighbourhood is now gentrified and upscale. Jaffary ran for Toronto City Council and became alderman for Ward 7 in 1969. As senior alderman, he sat on both the city and Metro Toronto councils. He was re-elected in 1972 but decided not to run in the 1974 election. During his tenure, he was active in the reform wing of city council along with John Sewell. He was interested in civic organization and administration and became involved in city housing policy."

Farewelled in court in December 1959, he retired from the bench on his seventieth birthday. In 1951 he was appointed a knight of grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem. He married Jessie Street, social reformer. They had four children including Sir Laurence Street who also attained the position of Chief Justice. His daughter Philippa married the Australian Test cricketer and journalist Jack Fingleton. Street died on 15 February 1972 and was accorded a state funeral. His youngest son Sir Laurence achieved in 1974 the rare distinction of occupying the same office of chief justice as had his father and grandfather."

  "text" : "Kenneth Marks (15 June 1920 – 13 January 1988) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. Marks was Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester Gorton from a 1967 by-election to 1983. From 1975 to 1979, he was a junior Environment minister. Before his by-election success he served as a Labour councillor on the Denton Urban District Council, representing Denton West. Although reselected to fight Manchester Gorton at the 1983 general election, boundary changes substantially altered the constituency boundaries, with the largest part of the constituency, Denton and Audenshaw in Tameside Metropolitan Borough, merging with Reddish in Stockport Metropolitan Borough to form a new Denton and Reddish constituency. Gorton was included with much of the former Manchester Ardwick constituency, which was renamed Manchester Gorton. As there were potentially three Labour MPs contesting two new seats, Marks, who was the senior of the three, stood down, allowing Stockport North's Andrew Bennett to inherit Denton and Reddish and Gerald Kaufman to move across from Ardwick to the new Gorton seat."

Before Yates was elected the MLA for Regina Dewdney he was employed by the Saskatchewan provincial government as a social worker and corrections worker for 15 years. He was the chief negotiator for the public service bargaining unit of SGEU for six years. Yates was first elected to the Saskatchewan Legislature in a 1999 by-election for Regina Dewdney. He was re-elected in 2003. In 2006 Yates was named to the Executive Council of Saskatchewan as Minister of Corrections and Public Safety and Deputy Government House Leader. On September 15, 2006, Yates stepped down from his position as the Minister of Corrections and Public Safety for \"personal reasons\", which he declined to name, beyond explaining that he was not stepping down for health-related issues. Some media sources, along with Saskatchewan Party Opposition Leader Brad Wall, speculated that his \"resignation\" was the result of insubordination to Saskatchewan Premier Lorne Calvert. Following a May 31, 2007 cabinet shuffle, Yates returned to cabinet as Minister of Community Resources and Minister Responsible for Disability Issues."

He is the highest ranking Punjabi and Sikh in the political party, which is dominated by Tamils. However, he is not the sole Sikh in the Malaysian parliament. The member being Karpal Singh who is from the opposition Democratic Action Party. To top it up, he is one of the seven member of parliaments from the MIC, making him a minority within a minority. Growing up, Nijhar recollects the times he had to stay in a kampung house without any basic amenities and had to depend on wells for water, and Hindu temples for free meals because of poverty. While a student at St Xavier's Institution in Penang, he used to earn money as a ball boy at clubs with tennis courts. But this did not stop him from excelling in school. He topped the school examinations between 1947 and 1954. “My passion to serve the community exceeds my desire to make money in the business world,” he said, adding that he had saved the Selangor MIC building from being auctioned off, and had also refinanced two of his cars to organise a national economic congress in 1980. In the Malaysian parliament, he sits on the Public Accounts Committee. He had also served on the National Unity Committee. Nijhar was dropped as a candidate for the 2008 general elections. The Barisan Nasional candidate for the constituency, S. Murugeson was defeated by the candidate from the Justice Party, Sivarasa Rasiah."

  "text" : "K. Parthiban is a Malaysian politician of Indian (specifically Tamil) descent. He is a member of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), a component party of the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, and has been the party's Tanjung Karang division secretary since 2002. In 2003, he was appointed as a special officer to the incumbent Tanjung Karang MP, Datuk Noh Omar. Parthiban was born in Ladang Raja Musa, Kuala Selangor district, Selangor. He attended the Seri Kota Teachers' Training College in Kuala Lumpur before enrolling in the University of Malaya, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree and later a Master of Education (M.Ed.) in Education Management. Parthiban was as a teacher from 1994 to 2006 at various schools in Tanjung Karang and Kuala Selangor prior to entering politics. On 16 April 2007, despite being a relative novice in politics, Parthiban was chosen as the BN candidate in the 2007 Ijok by-election. Parthiban eventually defeated Khalid Ibrahim of Parti Keadilan Rakyat in a straight fight. In the 2008 Malaysian general elections, K. Parthiban contested in the N10 Bukit Melawati, Selangor State Legislative Assembly and eventually lost to Muthiah a/l Maria Pillay from Parti KeADILan Rakyat by a slim majority of 297 votes."

  "text" : "Kevin Joseph Moss (born 1 February 1946) is an Australian politician. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1986 to 2003, representing the electorate of Canterbury. Moss was born in Sydney, and was educated at St Pauls Convent School in Dulwich Hill and St Patrick's Church Hill. He was elected to the City of Canterbury council in 1973, and served as deputy mayor in 1976 and 1979 before being elected by his colleagues as mayor in 1980. He served as mayor until the year after his election to parliament, and was employed as a staffer at the party's head office during his period. Moss won Labor preselection to contest the state seat of Canterbury in 1986 when the appointment of former Labor minister Kevin Stewart as the state's Agent-General in London created the need for a by-election. Canterbury was considered a safe seat for the Labor Party, and Moss was elected with over 53% of the primary vote. He was re-elected four times as the member for Canterbury, and served as a parliamentary secretary in the first two terms of the Carr government. Moss retired at the 2003 election, and was succeeded by Labor member Linda Burney."

He was educated at Rajkumar College, Raipur and at Mayo College, Ajmer. He became the Raja of Ramgarh in 1919 upon death of his father, Raja Lakshmi Narain Singh. He served as the Vice-President of the Bihar Landholder's Association and the All India Kshatriya Mahasabha. He was also Member of the Managing Committee and General Council of Rajkumar College; Member of the Executive Body of the Bihar War Committee. He served as president of Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha in 1943 and 1953. He was married to Maharani Lalita Rajya Lakshmi Devi, daughter of Supradipta Manyabara Lt.Gen. Maharajkumar Singha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal in 1936. They had a son, Indra Jitendra Narain Singh. He entered politics in 1946 following the formal accession of the Ramgarh state into the Indian Republic. In 1952 Bihar Assembly elections, he contested from Dhanbad as a candidate of Swatantra Party but was defeated by a noted freedom-fighter and labor rights leader, Purushottam K. Chauhan. Later in the Bihar Assembly Elections of 1967, serious opposition was offered by the Raja Bahadur's Swatantra Party to the ruling Congress government. The Raja Bahadur and his younger brother, Dr. Basant Narayan Singh, became Cabinet Ministers in the government headed by Chief Minister of Bihar, Mahamaya Prasad Sinha. He resigned from the party because he was not made the Deputy Chief Minister. In late 1960s, Kamakhya Narayan Singh was popularly an aspirant for Rajput supremacy in Bihar against Rajput stalwart, Sri Satyendra Narain Singh (then known as \"Coming Chief Minister of Bihar\") but was outmanoeuvred. His party later merged with the Janata party. Many of his family members became important political functionaries and legislators."

He left the legislature in an unsuccessful bid for Texas land commissioner in the 2002 Republican primary election. He was defeated by current commissioner Jerry E. Patterson, a former state senator from Houston. From 1981-1985, George was an assistant secretary of commerce, under Malcolm Baldrige, Jr., during the first term of U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan. In this capacity, George was involved in the formulation of the Caribbean Basin Initiative. and the specific stabilization of the Caribbean island of Grenada after its liberation in 1983 from a leftist regime backed by Fidel Castro. The CBI, since overshadowed by the North American Free Trade Agreement, was an unprecedented package of trade, assistance, and tax incentives for United States and Caribbean businesses. In the additional role as the Director General of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, George chaired an inter-agency committee which oversees the operations of the CBI. Native Texan George attended San Jacinto Junior High School in Midland with George W. Bush, who is two years Kenn George's senior. In 1970, George graduated from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. He earned his Master of Business Administration from the University of Texas at Austin, where he was the student body president of the graduate business school. Like Bush, George is a veteran of the Texas National Guard. He and his wife, Tricia, have four children."

Sacilotto owned Professionals Darwin and had worked in Residential & Commercial real estate prior to her political career, and was also Vice President of the REINT. Sacilotto was one of the surprise victors of Labor's 2005 landslide election win, defeating the Country Liberal Party incumbent Sue Carter. Although Carter had suffered a 10-point swing in 2001, there was little hint that she was in any serious danger of losing what had long been the safest CLP seat in Darwin. However, in a shock result, the count remained on a knife-edge for several days after the election. On the final count, Sacilotto unseated Carter by 73 votes on a swing of 8.4 percent, just barely enough to take the seat off the CLP. She served one term in the Assembly before John Elferink regained Port Darwin for the CLP."

  "text" : "Kerry Roberts (born September 24, 1961) is a Republican member of the Tennessee Senate for the 25th District, which includes Robertson County, Dickson County, Cheatham County, Humphreys County and Hickman County. . Prior to redistricting in 2012 he was the Senator representing the 18th district, encompassing Springfield, as well as Robertson County and Sumner County. Senate District 18 was greatly altered in the redistricting after the 2010 census and Roberts' home county of Robertson was moved to Senate District 25, requiring Roberts to wait until 2014 to run for re-election to the Tennessee Senate. He was succeeded by another Republican, Ferrell Haile, in November 2012. Roberts won the August 7, 2014 Republican Primary with 42 percent of the vote in a four-way primary, and then defeated Democratic Party nominee Tony Gross in the November 4, 2014, General Election with 70 percent of the vote. Tennessee State Senators are elected to four-year terms."

In fact, most of what Mr. Malaviya achieved, with the unstinted support of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, in those early days of Nehru’s national project of modernizing the nation and making it industrially competent has, over the years, provided and continues to provide a strong foundation to the economic success story that India is today. His commitment to India's progress for gaining self-reliance in energy sector was a shining example of the patriotism for the younger generation and a source of strength to the scientific community. Clear in his thoughts and supremely purposeful in his action, he was an inspiration for the younger generation of that era to come together in the hunt to find oil and secure the country’s future."

  "text" : "Kathleen D'Olier Courtney was born the youngest of five daughters and the fifth of seven children of Lieutenant (later Major) David Charles Courtney (1845-1909) of the Royal Engineers (a native of Milltown, County Dublin, Ireland), and his wife, Alice Margaret (née Mann) at 1 York Terrace, was born in Gillingham on 11 March 1878. Courtney attended and became educated at the private the Anglo-French College in Kensington and the Manse boarding-school in Malvern before spending seven months in Dresden studying the German language. In January 1897 she went to Lady Margaret Hall to study modern languages. The Courtney family were extremely wealthy and never had to worry about finances and in that case, she decided to devote her life to good causes where she was able to help people. In 1908 she was appointed secretary of the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage. One of its members, Helena Swanwick, later revealed that Courtney arrived in Manchester \"with a big reputation\" as an outstanding organizer. In 1911 she moved to London where she worked closely with Millicent Fawcett, an English feminist, intellectual, political and union leader, and writer as honorary secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. A suffragist and Honorary Secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she abandoned her active campaigning for women's suffrage and devoted her life to studying international politics and trying to build bridges towards international cooperation. In April 1915, Aletta Jacobs, a suffragist in the Netherlands, invited suffrage members all over the world to an International Congress of Women in The Hague. Some of the women who attended included Kathleen Courtney, Mary Sheepshanks, Jane Addams, Alice Hamilton, Grace Abbott, Emily Bach,de:Lida Gustava Heymann, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Emily Hobhouse, Chrystal Macmillan, Rosika Schwimmer. At the conference the women formed the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WIL). Kathleen Courtney ultimately was elected as chairperson of the British section. In 1928, she was named a member of the Executive Committee of the British League of Nations Union. In 1939 (the year WWII would begin) she was elected Vice-Chairman. From 1949 to 1951 she served as Chairman. Courtney continued to be involved in the campaign for women's suffrage. She helped establish the Adult Suffrage Society in 1916 and as joint-secretary she lobbied members of the House of Commons for extension of the franchise until the Qualification of Women Act was passed in 1918. The following year she became vice-president of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship. As well as advocating the same voting rights as men, the organisation also campaigned for equal pay, fairer divorce laws and an end to the discrimination against women in the professions. Kathleen Courtney died at her home, unmarried with no children, at 3 Elm Tree Court on 7 December 1974 at age 96. A memorial service was held on 11 April 1975 at St Martin-in-the-Fields."
