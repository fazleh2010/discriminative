She was a former member of the London Assembly for Lambeth and Southwark, between May 2000 and May 2016, when she voluntarily stood down. Shawcross was the Labour Co-operative candidate for Bermondsey and Old Southwark at the 2010 general election. She was first elected to the Assembly in 2000 and retained her seat in 2004 and 2008. In 2000 Ken Livingstone appointed her as Chair of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) a position she held until his defeat in 2008. She was the Labour London Assembly Spokesperson for Transport and Chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee. She also currently serves on the Assembly Budget Scrutiny Committee. She is a former Labour Party national women's officer, and was a councillor for New Addington in Croydon from 1994 to 2000, serving as Chair of Education, then Leader of Croydon Council. She was previously employed by the Inner London Education Authority, The World University Service, The UK Council for Overseas Students Affairs, The Commonwealth Secretariat, and the National Federation of Women's Institutes. Shawcross was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2002 for her services to local government. She is married to Michael Anteney. On 7 December 2010 it was announced that Shawcross would be the running mate of the Labour Party's official candidate for the 2012 London Mayoral election, Ken Livingstone. Shawcross narrowly failed in an attempt to become the Labour candidate for the safe Labour seat of Croydon North to Steve Reed for the 2012 Croydon North by-election after a meeting was held on 3 November 2012 of the local Croydon North Labour Association. In 2015 she announced that she would not seek re-election to the London Assembly at the 2016 elections. In May 2016 Sadiq Khan appointed her Deputy Mayor of London for Transport and Deputy Chair of Transport for London."

  "text" : "Pertti Olavi \"Veltto\" Virtanen (born 18 May 1951 in Hämeenlinna) is a rock personality, former presidential candidate, and former member of the Finnish Parliament from Tampere, Finland. In music he performed both as a solo artist and in the bands Virtanen (with Moog Konttinen), Välikausitakki and Sammas. Elektroninen xstaasi is considered the most famous of Veltto Virtanen's songs. Välikausitakki was notable for including also Mikko Alatalo, Harri Rinne and later also Juice Leskinen. After running as an avowed spoiler in the 1994 presidential election, his surprisingly respectable popular vote spurred him to run in the 1995 election for the house of representatives as an essentially independent candidate, and indeed managed to get in. His terms in the Parliament were characteristically quixotic; the speeches he made being exercises in near-shamanistic eloqution, and counter to parliamentary protocol refusing to bare his head, sporting various headgear, but being most famous for his \"artistic\" beret. Although mostly a picturesque spice to the daily routines of the institution, he enjoyed considerable respect from many colleagues in the house. The negligible party KiPu which tactically allied themselves to Veltto, never gained a member of its own, with or without his help; and thus he formed a one-man party-group in the house. Outside critics of the phenomenon of his political success wrote a muckraking book Huijari - Veltto Virtanen & Kirjava Puolue (publisher: Veitikka Kustannus 1999). He continued in elective politics by running in the 1999 and 2003 parliamentary elections with prodigious electoral votes, but failing to enter the house due to the punitive nature for minor parties of the Finnish D'Hondt method of voting. Virtanen became again a member of Parliament in parliamentary elections of 2007, this time representing the True Finns party. He served two terms but did not run as candidate anymore in the parliamentary elections of 2015 Besides his musical and political career, he has also worked as a motivational speaker, most notably for some winter sports teams. Currently he is a member of the Finnish Parliament and municipal council of Tampere. In Mayday 2011 the newly elected member of the parliament delivered a somewhat controversial political Mayday speech, where he stated that if the Swedish People's Party were to become part of the next cabinet with the True Finns, he would resign from the party and vomit for five days. - Jos perussuomalaiset lähtevät samaan hallitukseen RKP:n kanssa, eroan puolueesta ja oksennan viisi päivää."

He later worked as a teacher and guidance counsellor at Timmins High and Vocational School before entering municipal politics. Power is married to the former Clarice Dillon. They have one son, Kevin, who is a physician in Ottawa. He was first elected to Timmins City Council as a city councillor in 1968, and served for twelve years before being elected mayor in 1980. He served as such until 1988, when he was defeated by Dennis Welin. Power returned to the mayoralty for a term later in 1991 and served continuously until 2000. He first announced his retirement from politics in 2000, and was succeeded as mayor by Jamie Lim. In the 2003 municipal election, however, Power challenged Lim and was re-elected mayor. Power has also served as president of the Federation of Northern Ontario Municipalities, and as a director of Ontario Northland Transportation Commission and the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. Power's mayoralty has been marked by ongoing efforts to diversify the city's mining-based economy. In 2004, he received national attention when he criticized the producers of Shania: A Life in Eight Albums, a television biopic of country star Shania Twain, for producing the film in Sudbury rather than Twain's actual hometown, Timmins. On August 31, 2006, Power announced his second retirement from politics; he would not be seeking the mayoralty in the 2006 elections. He was succeeded by Tom Laughren, the sole declared candidate for the mayoralty. On May 31, 2007, the city's airport was renamed Timmins/Victor M. Power Airport in honor of the former mayor. In attendance were several councillors and politicians from across the region. Power received the Order of Canada in 2009."

As chair of the Select Standing Committee on Health from 2001-2003 and again in 2004/05, Roddick produced reports on health care that included restructuring of health authorities in 2001. The downsizing of Delta Hospital in her riding by Fraser Health was a significant factor in the 2003 recall campaign against Roddick. After appearing to surpass the required 40 per cent of signatures, the recall petition was submitted to Elections BC which ruled the petition was unsuccessful due to disqualification of more than 3,100 signatures, mostly by ineligible voters. On June 5, 2008, she announced that she would not seek re-election in the 2009 provincial election. Her family established a farm fertilizer business in 1971."

He was assassinated in 1998 while in Russia. Hubulov was born in Tskhinvali in 1966. He was trained as a high school teacher at Tskhinvali University, specializing in physics and mathematics. He graduated in 1990. From 1984 till 1986, Hubulov served in the Soviet Army. In 1991 he was elected the First Secretary of the South Ossetian Komsomol and as a member of the Central Committee of Soviet Komsomol. Hubulov was an active participant in the 1991–1992 South Ossetia War, leading and coordinating various resistance groups against the Georgian invasion. After the war, he participated in the signing of the Sochi agreement. He also fought in the War in Abkhazia (1992–1993), leading a South Ossetian unit fighting on the Abkhazian side, for which he was awarded the Order of Leon by president Vladislav Ardzinba. In 1993, Hubulov initiated the founding of the South Ossetian ministry of defense, of which he became the first minister. At the same time, he was also made deputy PM in the cabinet of Gerasim Khugayev. When PM Vladislav Gabarayev was fired in August 1996, Hubulov, as deputy PM, succeeded him and became acting prime minister for several months, until a replacement was found in Aleksandr Shavlokhov. Valeriy Hubulov was assassinated by unknown killers at the market place of Vladikavkaz in North Ossetia–Alania on 31 May 1998. The gunmen opened fire on his car with AK-47s. Later, police found his car blown up in the yard of a neighbouring school, but the murderers were never caught."

  "text" : "Sir Vernon Haddon Treatt KBE, MM, QC (15 May 1897 – 20 September 1984) was an Australian lawyer, soldier, Rhodes Scholar and politician. Born in Singleton, New South Wales and educated at Shore School, Treatt interrupted his studies at the University of Sydney to enlist at the outbreak of the First World War. Serving in the Royal Australian Artillery, Treatt served in France and was awarded the Military Medal. Upon returning to Australia he was awarded a Rhodes scholarship and further educated at New College, Oxford. After briefly practising law in 1923 in Britain, Treatt returned to Australia and was admitted to the New South Wales bar that same year, serving as a Crown Prosecutor at the supreme court. Treatt also was the Challis law lecturer at the University of Sydney. Treatt entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 26 March 1938, representing the Electoral district of Woollahra for the United Australia Party (UAP). When UAP Premier Bertram Stevens was ousted from the leadership in August 1939 and Alexander Mair became Premier, Mair appointed Treatt, after serving only a few months in Parliament, as the Minister for Justice. He served in this office until the UAP lost power in 1941. During this time Treatt witnessed the break-up of the UAP into the various parties including the Democratic Party, which he joined, and then the establishment of the Liberal Party of Australia as the major conservative political force in Australia in 1945. When the second leader of the party, Alexander Mair, resigned in March 1946, Treatt was elected to succeed him. As the third leader of the new party, Treatt became the first leader to contest an election. After serving eight years and almost winning government at the 1950 election, Treatt resigned as Leader in August 1954 following a July attempt to depose him. He continued as a member of parliament until he was defeated in 1962 and thereafter served in various organisations and posts, including as a Chief Commissioner of the City of Sydney in 1969, until his death in 1984."

Sampla, who studied till Class 10, joined the party in 1998. He is the second minister from Punjab after Akali Dal's Harsimrat Kaur Badal. His political journey began after he was elected the Sarpanch or head of his Sofi village (Jalandhar District). He has held several key posts in the BJP's Punjab unit. When he was a 27-year-old bereaved dalit, Sampla was trying to find his feet against the oppressive landlords of Jalandhar's Sofi Pind. His brother and he were left to fend for themselves after their father's death and Sampla went off to Saudi Arabia in 1979 to work for a plumbing company. On his swearing-in as BJP's first minister from Punjab in NDA-II, he says, \"I often recall one incident that shaped my life. While I was in Saudi Arabian city of Damam, I was asked to clean human excreta and repair a bathroom. I was young and flatly refused to do the cleaning part while telling the building owner that I was a plumber. On my insistence, the man put on plastic gloves and cleaned the muck himself. It taught me the difference between oppression against dalits and the will to work\", Sampla recalled."
