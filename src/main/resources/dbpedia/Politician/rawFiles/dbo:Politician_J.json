  "text" : "John Kent (1805 in Wexford, Ireland – September 1, 1872 in St. John's, Newfoundland), arrived in Newfoundland in 1820 and started working for his uncle Patrick Morris. He was influential in establishing a large Irish population on the island. He was elected to the first House of Assembly in 1832 as a Liberal. John Kent was a champion of Catholic rights on an island that was deeply divided along religious lines. He worked for the reform movement along with William Carson and Morris that successfully persuaded the British Colonial Office to institute responsible government in Newfoundland. Kent became Colonial Secretary under Philip Francis Little. From 1848 to 1855 he was Speaker of the Newfoundland House of Assembly. He became Premier after Little resigned in 1858. He won the election of 1859 but his government was engulfed by crisis in 1861 when it tried to lower the salary of (mostly Protestant) government officials, including judges who sued the government. In the legislature Kent accused Governor Sir Alexander Bannerman and the opposition Conservatives of conspiring with the judges against the government. Bannerman responded by dismissing the Kent's government in March 1861 and installing Hugh Hoyles as Premier of a Conservative government. The Liberals defeated the Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence resulting in an election campaign that was fought along sectarian lines with Catholics largely voting Liberal and Protestants largely voting Conservative. The Protestant Conservative Party of Newfoundland narrowly defeated Kent's Liberals and riots erupted in Catholic Harbour Grace when the governor cancelled voting there essentially denying the Liberals two seats in the legislature and allowing the Conservatives to have a legislative majority. Kent later joined Sir Frederick Carter's coalition government that attempted to heal the rifts and create a cross denominational compromise that allowed power sharing between Catholics and Protestants, the funding of all denominational schools and the creation of political parties that included members of all denominations."

  "text" : "Joy K. MacPhail (born March 6, 1952) is a former Canadian politician in British Columbia. A longtime member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party, she served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from 1991 to 2005 and as a Minister of the Crown from 1993–1999, and 2000-2001. MacPhail was born in Hamilton, Ontario, but has lived in Vancouver for almost three decades. She studied economics at the University of Western Ontario, and later earned a degree in labour studies at the London School of Economics. She has one son. MacPhail was first elected to the British Columbia Legislature in 1991 as the MLA for Vancouver-Hastings, and served in the cabinets of three NDP premiers. Under Premier Mike Harcourt, she served as Minister of Social Services from 1993 to 1996. Under Premier Glen Clark she served a short stint as Minister of Social Services, then as Minister of Health from 1996 to 1998. MacPhail's final cabinet position in the Clark government was as Minister of Finance from 1998 to 1999, when she quit the Clark government at a time when it was suffering from increasing dissent and scandal. When Clark eventually quit the NDP leadership, MacPhail ran for NDP leader, but did not attract significant legislative caucus support. She withdrew when it became obvious that Ujjal Dosanjh had an insurmountable lead. Under Dosanjh, she was the Deputy Premier and served as Minister of Labour and later, Minister of Education. The NDP suffered a massive electoral blow in the May 16, 2001 provincial election, winning only two seats—those of MacPhail and Environment Minister Jenny Kwan. MacPhail only held onto her seat by 409 votes. Exactly one month after the election, MacPhail was appointed as the party's interim leader. She was a harsh critic of the new BC Liberal Premier Gordon Campbell. Although the NDP was the only other party in the legislature, it was four seats short of official party status. Despite this, Assembly Speaker Claude Richmond ensured that the NDP was resourced as an opposition and she was recognized by the Speaker as the Leader of the Opposition. MacPhail stepped down as leader in 2003 and was succeeded by Carole James. She remained as parliamentary leader of the NDP until her retirement from politics after the 2005 election. Following her departure from politics, MacPhail married film and television producer James Shavick, and is currently a partner in his production firm Shavick Entertainment. She is a member of the board of OutTV, a Canadian cable television station owned by Shavick Entertainment, and focused on the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities. She has also appeared as a member of political panels on As It Happens on CBC Radio."

A retail developer from Oxford, North Carolina, Crawford served fourteen terms in the state House of Representatives. In his last term he served as one of the chairmen of the House Appropriations committee (and the only Democrat to be a chairman in the Republican-majority House). Crawford earned a degree in Industrial Relations from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After serving in the United States Navy and as an Oxford city commissioner, Crawford was first elected to the legislature in 1982. He considered a run for Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina in 1988, but dropped out and was re-elected to the House. In 1992, he ran for Lt. Governor, losing in the Democratic primary to Dennis Wicker. Crawford's seat in the House was won by Richard H. Moore. When Moore ran for Congress in 1994, Crawford won the seat back. He was re-elected without opposition in 2006. In 2008 and in 2010, he was opposed by Libertarian Barbara Howe. In 2012, after supporting the budget passed by the House Republican majority and after supporting the bill that put North Carolina Amendment 1 before the voters, Crawford was defeated in the May 8 Democratic primary by fellow Rep. Winkie Wilkins. The Republican majority had placed both Democratic lawmakers in the new 2nd District during redistricting. Crawford endorsed Republican Pat McCrory in the subsequent general election for Governor. McCrory later appointed Crawford to the state Board of Transportation."

He was defeated in the 2006 Republican primary by Thom Tillis, losing by an almost 2-to-1 margin. Rhodes was the first member of the North Carolina House to call for the resignation of Speaker James B. Black, after Black was accused of ethics violations and malfeasance. Though Rhodes' impact in the case is open to debate, Black later resigned from the House after winning re-election in 2006 and was convicted on state and federal charges in 2007. A grassroots effort called John Rhodes Day is celebrated March 22 of each year. Rhodes ran as a write-in candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2014. In unofficial results, the state reported that Rhodes had received 621 votes."

Carrington was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; he enlisted in the United States Army in 1953 and served as a paratrooper during the Korean War until 1955. Following his military service, he completed his high school education in 1957 and earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Widener College in 1962. Professionally, Carrington rose to become CEO of the Sirchie Group, a company specializing in evidence-collection gear for police and top-dollar security products for businesses. He was first elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1995. In 2005, Carrington was charged with illegally exporting evidence-collection gear to China and took a plea bargain in December 2005 to felony charges in which he has been fined $850,000. One of his companies also took a plea agreement in the matter. The law was altered to allow such exports a few years later. Many large companies have had to make files to track their resold goods to avoid penalty. The charge was for rape kits, finger print imaging kits, finger printing powder kits, and other evidence collecting products, etc. The effects were not sold directly to China, but were resold without the explicit knowledge of Carrington. Paper handling and documentation were handled badly by Carrington. However, under the law this circumstance was not an exception and a guilty plea was submitted."

  "text" : "John Biggs (born 19 November 1957) is a British Labour and Co-operative Party politician and the current Mayor of Tower Hamlets. Biggs is a former member of the London Assembly representing the City and East constituency from 2000 until 2016.. He is a former leader of Tower Hamlets London Borough Council. Biggs has worked as a financial analyst in the City of London, and as director of a political pressure group. He has previously studied Chemistry, Computer Science and Law. He was the Labour candidate for directly elected Mayor of Tower Hamlets in 2014, receiving backing from Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone. Livingstone supported incumbent Lutfur Rahman in 2010, but shifted his support to Biggs after an investigation into allegations of \"mismanagement and fraud\" by the current mayor's team at the council. However, Livingstone also remained supportive of Rahman. Biggs came second in the election to Rahman, but the election was subsequently over-turned by an election court. On 11 June 2015 Biggs was elected mayor of Tower Hamlets after Rahman was found by the court to have broken election law and was stripped of office. Biggs beat independent Rabina Khan, who was endorsed by the disqualified Rahman."

  "text" : "John Robertson (3 February 1913 – May 1987) was a British politician, who sat as a Labour Member of Parliament before co-founding the Scottish Labour Party (SLP) in 1976. Robertson was a toolmaker and engineer and was assistant divisional organiser of the Amalgamated Engineering Union 1954-61 and secretary of the Scottish Iron and Steel Trades Joint Committee. He served as a councillor on Lanarkshire County Council and Motherwell and Wishaw Council from 1946. At the 1951 general election Robertson stood as the Labour candidate in the marginal Conservative-held seat of Glasgow Scotstoun, losing by 625 votes. He was elected to the House of Commons ten years later at the 1961 by-election in the Paisley constituency, following the appointment of sitting MP Douglas Johnston as a judge in the Court of Session. He was re-elected at five subsequent general elections, sitting as a Labour MP until 1976, and for the SLP between 1976 and 1979. He did not contest the 1979 general election. On 18 January 1976 Robertson, along with another Labour MP, Jim Sillars and Labour's senior Scottish researcher, Alex Neil, officially established the Scottish Labour Party (SLP).The formation of the SLP was prompted as a left-wing split from the mainstream Labour Party over distrust about how strong the then Labour government's stated commitment to Scottish devolution was in reality. Robertson was a leading figure in the SLP, along with Sillars, but unlike Sillars he stood down at the 1979 general election, deciding not to contest his Paisley seat. The Scottish Labour Party was officially disbanded in 1981, after failing to win any seats at the 1979 general election."

  "text" : "John Golding (9 March 1931 – 20 January 1999) was a Labour Party politician and Trade Union leader in the United Kingdom. He was educated at Chester City Grammar School, Keele University and the London School of Economics. After some time working in the Civil Service he took up a research job with the Post Office Engineering Union. Golding was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme at a by-election in 1969. He served in the governments of Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan, as PPS to Eric Varley as Minister of Technology, a Labour whip in opposition, and Minister for Employment. He was an outspoken opponent of Labour left-wingers such as Tony Benn and Eric Heffer, whom he regarded as idle dreamers out of touch with the working-class. Golding was a key figure in opposing the entryist Militant group, and especially in mobilising moderate trades union leaders to exercise their block votes to achieve this end. After he died, his writings were published under the title Hammer of the Left: My Part in Defeating the Labour Left by John Golding and Paul Farrelly (see below). In 1986 he left Parliament (by applying for the Chiltern Hundreds) to take up the post of General Secretary of the National Communications Union. He held this post until 1988. He had served as a member of the council of the Trades Union Congress. After he vacated the Newcastle-under-Lyme seat, the resulting by-election was won by his wife Llin, who held the seat until 2001; her successor in the seat was Paul Farrelly. John Golding's most unusual claim to fame is that he once made a speech in committee lasting eleven hours and fifteen minutes. It nominally concerned a small amendment to the bill to privatise British Telecom. This filibuster was instrumental in delaying the privatisation until after the 1983 general election, but with Margaret Thatcher obtaining a massive parliamentary majority the privatisation was soon forced through. Changes in British parliamentary procedure mean that Golding's record is unlikely ever to be beaten."

He served one term as the fifth mayor of the town of Calgary, Alberta from January 20, 1890 to January 19, 1891. Lafferty was born in Perth, Ontario in 1849 and attended local schools. He then worked as deputy registrar of titles in Kingston to finance his further education. He graduated from Queen's University medical school in 1871. Lafferty practised medicine for a year in Perth before becoming a senior resident at Ward Island hospital (later Bellevue Hospital) in New York City and at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. Lafferty next took a post-graduate course at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, England. In 1873, he set up practice in Pembroke, Ontario; later that same year, he married Jessie P. Grant. From 1877 to 1880, Lafferty also operated a drug store in Pembroke. In 1880, he was named associate coroner for Renfrew County. The following year, Lafferty was offered the position of chief surgeon for the eastern division of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba later that year. Lafferty and his family had moved to Regina, Saskatchewan by 1885 and then moved on to Calgary in December 1885. In Calgary, Lafferty took on the contracts to provide medical services for the CPR mainline and for the nearby Indian reservation. In 1889, he was a founding member of the North West Territories Medical Association and, in the following year, was elected to the medical council for the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the North West Territories. He served on the council until 1906, also serving three terms as president. In 1901, he became medical registrar for the North West Territories. When the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were formed, Lafferty drafted the Medical ProfessionActs for both provinces. In 1906, he organized the meeting which formed the Alberta Medical Association. Later that same year, he organized the first meeting of the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons. Lafferty served as Registrar-Treasurer for the college until 1911. From 1907 to 1910, he served as chair of the Provincial Board of Health. He also served as first president of the Calgary Medical Society. Lafferty retired from the practice of medicine in 1909 but served as a hospital inspector from 1909 until 1918 (or possibly later). Lafferty was also involved in the operation of a chain of private banks in western Canada known as the Lafferty and Smith Banks in partnership with Frederick G. Smith. He left that partnership in 1889 and formed the Lafferty and Moore Bank. In 1893, Lafferty and Moore was acquired by the Bank of Montreal. Lafferty ran for the Liberal Party in the provisional district of Alberta in the 1887 Canadian federal election, but lost out to Conservative Donald Watson Davis. He died on July 29, 1920 in Calgary, aged 71."

  "text" : "James Reilly (March 28, 1835 – July 9, 1909) was a Canadian businessman and politician. He was the sixth mayor of Calgary, Alberta. Reilly was born in 1835 in Napierville, Quebec to immigrant parents from Ireland. In Quebec he became an architect and builder before going to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1882, then to Calgary in 1883. In Calgary he became actively involved with the local community. He played a key part in organizing a citizens group concerned about the location of the railway station that was built in Calgary. While proprietor of the Royal Hotel, he organized the first civic committee meeting on January 4, 1884. This was the first step leading to Calgary's municipal incorporation later that year. Reilly ran in Calgary's second mayoral election in 1885, but was defeated by popular incumbent George Murdoch. On January 19, 1891, he was elected as the sixth mayor of Calgary. He served one term, but then was re-elected a few years later as the twelfth mayor. Reilly also served two years on city council. As a member of the Liberal Party of Canada, Reilly unsuccessfully ran for federal politics. In October 1899, Reilly left Calgary and traveled extensively. He retired in Victoria, British Columbia, where he died on July 9, 1909 from influenza. His death came as a shock to many, as his condition had been seemingly improving. He was later interred in Calgary. After his death, it was said that \"to write the life of the late James Reilly is to rewrite the history of Calgary.\" Reilly was married to May Watts."

  "text" : "John Alexander Frances MacDougall (born April 20, 1947 in Port Hood, Nova Scotia) is a former Canadian politician. He represented the riding of Timiskaming in the Canadian House of Commons from 1982 to 1993, as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party. He first entered Parliament in 1982, in a byelection following the death of the riding's prior MP, Bruce Lonsdale. On April 23, 1993, MacDougall became the centre of controversy when he made comments in the House of Commons attacking Sunera Thobani, the new head of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women: Thobani, in fact, had just received her landed immigrant status, and MacDougall's comments were widely criticized as racist. MacDougall did not run for reelection in the 1993 election."

On September 23, 1990, Kelleher was appointed to the Canadian Senate on Mulroney's recommendation. He retired from the upper house upon his seventy-fifth birthday, October 2, 2005, due to the Senate's mandatory retirement rules. He died of heart problems in 2013."

She is the appointed chair of the Ottawa Public Library board, which sets policy and has the ultimate say in decisions affecting the library system. Born in Ottawa, she spent her youth in a number of different Ontario cities. Trained as a radiological technician, she eventually became an executive in the grocery business. She first entered politics in 1997 when she was elected to Nepean city council. With the creation of the new amalgamated city of Ottawa in 2000, Harder ran against regional councillor Molly McGoldrick-Larsen. While the race was expected to be close, Harder ended up winning by several thousand votes. She was reelected in the 2003 Ottawa election, by defeating newcomer John R. Palmer. One of her first efforts on city council was the successful campaign to replace the new coat of arms with that of the old city of Ottawa. She also led a campaign to have filters installed on computers in the public libraries that would keep users from accessing pornography. In the November 2006 municipal elections, Harder retained her position as councillor with 75% of the vote in Barrhaven Ward. Harder was criticized for the appearance of a conflict of interest for having accepted a free corporate box seat at the 2007 Stanley Cup NHL hockey playoff game (Senators v.s. Anaheim Ducks) at Scotiabank Place from Waste Management Services—a company that the City does business with. She was accused of conflict of interest again in 2008 for allegedly endorsing a waste management company, Plasco, and accepting money in the form of a paid trip Harder is heavily active in Conservative politics and in the past mused about running federally in her riding. Her daughter, Elena ran for the vacant Orléans Ward seat in a by-election in January 2006, but was unsuccessful."

  "text" : "Jacquelin Holzman (born c. 1936) served as mayor of Ottawa, Canada, from 1991 to 1997. Never attending university, she married at age nineteen and started a family. She became a volunteer, especially on causes relating to the disabled. She was elected to Ottawa city council in 1982 representing the Richmond Ward (now Bay Ward), defeating future mayor Bob Chiarelli, and became one of the more right-leaning city councillors. Acclaimed in the 1985 election, she soon ran into controversy in her second term over an expansion to the Carlingwood Shopping Centre. Holzman supported the expansion but many of her constituents were opposed. In the 1988 Ottawa election, she faced a strong challenge from Alex Cullen but was re-elected with a solid majority. She was a close ally of mayor Jim Durrell and was described as his heir apparent. When he chose not to run for re-election, Holzman ran against left-leaning councillor Nancy Smith. Holzman ran on a pro-development and tax cut platform and defeated Smith and interim mayor Marc Laviolette. During her first term, she worked for the 'Yes' side in the Charlottetown Accord referendum. She worked hard to increase Ottawa's international status. In 1993 she represented Ottawa in Tokyo at the Third Capitals of the World Conference. In the same month, she led a trade mission to Taiwan to promote Taiwanese investment and tourism in Ottawa. During her term, she was a strong supporter of Taiwan establishing an office in Ottawa. In the 1994 mayoral election she faced a number of challengers. She was accused of arrogance for planning an expedition to China under the assumption she would win re-election. Her second term was also mostly uneventful. One major debate was over the mayor's desire to add an expensive unity tower to the new city hall. The tower was left unfinished, as it remains today. In November 1996 she announced that she would not run for re-election, citing the desire to spend more time with her family. She was expected to face a difficult election against city councillor Jim Watson. After leaving the mayor's office, she became head of the Ottawa Congress Centre. The next year she was diagnosed with breast cancer, but was treated successfully, and became an advocate for breast cancer related causes. In 2002 she became chair of the Ottawa Health Research Institute. She remained head of the Congress Centre before retiring in 2004. In 2007 she was appointed to the board of the National Capital Commission."

He was awarded the Officer of the Order of Australia, Australian Police Medal, Centenary Medal and National Medal. He is also the author of a popular book titled Police - Force or Service? which he wrote as an Inspector, ultimately resulting in the organisations' name being changed from NSW Police Force to NSW Police Service. The library at the New South Wales Police College at Goulburn is named in his honour. The former headquarters of the New South Wales Police in College Street, Sydney was also named in his honour, named the Avery Building until the headquarters moved to a new building in Parramatta in 2003.

Mackie was born in Westminster, England in 1860 to Scottish parents. Hearing of opportunities in Canada, he emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1882. In Winnipeg, he learnt to become a gunsmith with Hingston Smith Arms Company. In 1885, he went back to England to convince his parents to return with him to Canada. They instead decided to go to Syracuse, New York then later San Francisco, California. While on route back to Canada, Mackie met Grace MacMillan Forgan. Forgan was heading to Omaha, Nebraska to be with her parents. They continued to write each other, and in February, 1892 they were married. Mackie headed to Calgary in 1886 to open a gun store. Mackie had short-lived business partnerships with Walter Mackay and Joseph Cockel that helped expand his business knowledge beyond gunsmithing. He ended up being involved with taxidermy, sports goods, fishing tackle, cutlery, fur, etc. In November 1899, he purchased the Thomson Bros. bookstore. In 1901, he bought the Thompson Stationary Company. In 1891, Mackie became a charter member of the Calgary Board of Trade, which is now the Chamber of Commerce. He spent six years as an Alderman of the Calgary City Council. He also held the position of mayor for one term. Mackie also got himself into real estate. He built the Mackie Block and the Lancaster building in Calgary, which are today prominent historical structures in downtown Calgary."

In 2005, while Mayor of Spokane, Washington, he was the target of allegations of the sexual abuse of boys twenty years earlier. These allegations became public after West became a target of a sting operation conducted by his hometown newspaper, the Spokesman Review. Some journalists and academics criticized the paper for what they saw as a form of entrapment. West admitted engaging in homosexual behavior with adults, despite an earlier record of supporting \"anti-gay\" legislation. Though never charged, he was removed from office by recall in 2005. The Federal Bureau of Investigation eventually closed its investigation and took no action for lack of evidence."

Morgan filed a lawsuit on behalf of CBRM against the Government of Nova Scotia alleging unequal per capita provincial funding for his municipality. Morgan had applied to the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board to reject the Boundary Review citing the citizenry want a downsized municipal council. The eventual decision was that the Boundary Review was flawed and will need to be re-done by 2010. On August 17, 2012, Morgan released a statement announcing that he would not reoffer in the 2012 municipal election. He was succeeded as mayor by Cecil Clarke."

He was elected in the 2001 B.C. election representing the British Columbia Liberal Party in the Chilliwack-Sumas riding. He won re-election in the 2005 B.C. election. He was re-elected in the newly created Chilliwack riding in the 2009 election. On March 28, 2008, John Les resigned from his position as Solicitor General pending the outcome of an investigation over allegations of misconduct during his tenure as Mayor of Chilliwack. A special prosecutor was appointed to look into a land deal that he was alleged to have benefited from. In June 2010, the investigation was concluded with the special prosecutor stating that while Les was given preferential treatment in the rezoning of one subdivision, there was not enough evidence to suggest that he used his public office directly to advance his personal interest. On August 30, 2012, Les announced that he would not seek re-election as MLA for Chilliwack."

Townshend was the son of John Townshend, 4th Marquess Townshend, and Elizabeth Jane Crichton-Stuart. The soldier George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend, was his paternal great-grandfather, and Prime Minister John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, was his maternal great-grandfather. He was elected to the House of Commons for Tamworth in 1855 (succeeding his father), a seat he held until 1863, when he inherited the marquessate on his father's death and entered the House of Lords. At the Salisbury Petty Sessions in May 1881, Lord Edward Thynne described how he had been accosted by Lord Townshend and two accomplices on the road between Laverstock and Salisbury. A Colonel Nepean held the pony's head while Townshend struck him several times with the handle of a horse whip. Thynne acknowledged having eloped with Lady Townshend in 1872, but noted that the Marquis had never sued for divorce, and alleged that Lord Macduff had attacked him over the same matter while he was abroad. Townshend was convicted of the assault, and sentenced to a fine of £500 or three months in prison. After some hours in jail, he reluctantly paid the fine, equivalent to £45,500 in 2017. Townshend denounced the court, while Vanity Fair reported unnamed others as saying \"the only regret is that he [Thynne] was not thrashed earlier and worse\". Lord Townshend married Lady Anne Elizabeth Clementina Duff, daughter of James Duff, 5th Earl Fife, on 17 October 1865. Their children included:"

She joined the Labour Party in 1946 and served as a councillor on North Yorkshire County Council. She was elected to Labour's National Executive Committee 1972–82 and 1983–87, and was Vice-Chair of the Labour Party 1980–81. She was appointed a Justice of the Peace at Thirsk in 1950. Having acted as Labour agent in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, Maynard was elected in 1974 as MP for Sheffield Brightside and held the seat until she retired in 1987. Throughout her political career Maynard advocated policies on the left of the Labour Party and chaired the left-wing Campaign Group. She served on the Agriculture Select Committee 1975–87. She played a leading role in securing the passage of the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 which regulated the tied cottage system that had caused misery to rural workers. Maynard died of cancer in Sowerby, North Yorkshire on 27 March 1998, the same day as fellow former MP, Joan Lestor. Her remains are buried alongside her immediate family at Thornton-le-Street."

  "text" : "James Graham, 6th Duke of Montrose KT CB CVO VD (1 May 1878 – 20 January 1954), was a Scottish nobleman, naval officer, politician and engineer. The eldest son of Douglas Graham, 5th Duke of Montrose, he was educated at Eton College. In 1906 he married Lady Mary Douglas-Hamilton, the only child of the 12th Duke of Hamilton. They had four children, Lord James Graham (later the 7th Duke), Lady Mary Graham, Lord Ronald Graham and Lady Jean Graham. As a mariner, he served in the Mercantile Marine and ASC in South Africa, during which time he obtained the first film ever taken of a total eclipse of the Sun during a Royal Astronomical Society expedition to India in 1899, and took part in a mission in 1900 for Lloyd's of London to the South African Government to establish wireless telegraphic stations on the coast. Having been instrumental in founding the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) in 1903, he served in the Auxiliary Naval Service during World War I and was later Commodore of the RNVR Clyde Division, then the East Coast of Scotland RNVR, and fulfilled the role of Commodore of the entire RNVR from 1921 until he retired in 1927. As a result, from 1946 to 1968, whichever ship was attached to the Tay Division of the Royal Naval Reserve (in Dundee) was always temporarily renamed HMS Montrose after the 6th Duke. In 1992, the seventh Duke-class frigate HMS Montrose was so-named for the same reason. In his political life, he was unpaid Assistant Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1905, and Naval Aide-de-Camp to His Majesty. However, he was unsuccessful as the Scottish Unionist Party (effectively the Conservative Party in Scotland) parliamentary candidate for Stirlingshire in 1906, and as the Conservative Party candidate at the 1906 by-election at Eye, Suffolk, and at the subsequent general election in 1910; although holding the courtesy title of the Marquess of Graham from 1907 (when his father was the 5th Duke), he contested these elections as James Graham. He entered the House of Lords as the 6th Duke when he succeeded to the title in 1925. When the Home Rule movement decided to split from the avowedly anti-Home Rule Scottish Unionist Party in 1932, he became chairman of the new centre-right Scottish Party, and successfully steered it towards a merger with the centre-left National Party of Scotland in April 1934, therefore founding the modern Scottish National Party. He joined the Liberal Party in 1936. As an engineer, he was the inventor of the world's first naval aircraft carrier, when in 1912, as a director of William Beardmore and Company, of Dalmuir, he designed a 14,450 ton merchant vessel intended for delivery to the Lloyd Sabaudo Line of Italy as the SS Conte Rosso. When war broke out in 1914, work on the vessel ceased, but was resumed in 1916 as an aircraft carrier. The conversion work was completed in September 1918 and the vessel was commissioned as HMS Argus - recognised as the first ever \"flat top\". The Duke was also designer and owner of the first seagoing heavy oil motorship. He was President of the British Institution of Marine Engineers in 1911, and President of the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1916 and 1917. Afterwards, he was Vice-President of the Institution of Naval Architects, a Younger Brother of Trinity House, a Trustee for the Honourable Company of Master Mariners, a Member of the Royal Company of Archers, and Commodore of the Sea Cadets in Scotland. In 1935 he became the second President on the National Institute for the Deaf, a post he held until his death."

  "text" : "Jun H. Choi (born May 17, 1971) is an American politician and the former Mayor of Edison, New Jersey, a community of over 100,000 people and the fifth largest municipality in the state. He was sworn in on January 1, 2006 as the youngest mayor in Edison history and the first Asian American mayor of a major city in New Jersey. He began a good government, reform movement that led to greater fiscal responsibility, economic development, public education improvements, environmental protection and civic engagement. Prior to becoming Mayor of Edison, Choi worked in both business and government. He served as a senior official on education policy at the New Jersey Department of Education where he started the NJ SMART Program, improving public school education performance metrics for 1.4 million New Jersey children. He also served in the White House Office of Management and Budget and worked as a management consultant focusing on strategy and technology issues for Fortune 500 US corporations. In May 2011 Choi announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for New Jersey's 7th congressional district, a seat currently held by Rep. Leonard Lance, a Republican. However, Choi put his campaign on hold after Edison was placed inside the 6th district by the new Congressional redistricting map. Choi earned a Bachelor of Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a master's degree in public policy and administration from Columbia University. Choi is also a Leadership New Jersey Fellow (Class of 2003)."

  "text" : "John Andrew Mara (July 21, 1840 – February 11, 1920) was a Canadian merchant, rancher and a politician at both the provincial and federal levels. Mara was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the province of British Columbia. He sat in the provincial legislature as the member from Yale. He ran for election as well as sat as both Government and Opposition - this was before political parties were allowed in the House. Federally, Mara was a Conservative and was twice acclaimed as a Member of Parliament in the federal riding of Yale before being defeated by Hewitt Bostock in the 1896 election in the new riding of Yale—Cariboo. Mara's greater claim to fame (or infamy) is the alleged seduction and pregnancy of Annie McLean, the sister of the \"Wild McLean Boys\". The McLeans were the halfbred children of the former HBC factor at Kamloops, Donald McLean, who had died in the Chilcotin War. Mara's alleged outrage of their sister led to the McLean brothers' bloody rampage across the Nicola Country and the death of provincial magistrate and gold commissioner Johnny Ussher. Mara owned the large ranchlands between Enderby and Sicamous where the Okanagan and Shuswap countries meet. Mara Mountain east of the original ranch, and Mara Lake south of Sicamous, bear his name. Today Mara Lake Provincial Park on Mara Lake is now a popular tourist destination during the summer months. The village of Mara still exists south of Mara Lake along the Shuswap River. Mara's wife Alice was the daughter of Frank Barnard, founder of the Barnard's Express Co. or \"B.X.\". Her brother, and therefore Mara's brother-in-law, was Sir Francis Stillman Barnard, 10th Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia (1914–1919)."

  "text" : "John Patrick Ducker AO (29 March 1932 - 25 November 2005), Australian labour leader and politician, played a leading role in the Australian labour movement and the Australian Labor Party for 20 years. Ducker was born in Kingston upon Hull, in northern England, the son of a bus driver, and worked on the docks from the age of 14. He migrated to Australia with his family in 1950, and became an ironworker and active in the Federated Ironworkers Association, at that time controlled by the Communist Party of Australia. Ducker, a convert to Catholicism, was a strong anti-Communist and became a supporter of B.A. Santamaria's Industrial Groups, which campaigned successfully to overturn the Communist control of the union. From 1952 Ducker was an official of the union under the new anti-Communist leader, Laurie Short (a non-Catholic). When the Labor Party split in 1955 over the related issues of Communism and the role of Santamaria's \"Movement\" within the party, Ducker did not follow many other Catholic anti-Communists into the Democratic Labor Party, but remained in the Labor Party, becoming a leading figure in the party's right wing. His characteristic North English accent led to him becoming known as \"Broovver Dooker\" throughout the movement. In 1961 Ducker moved from the Ironworkers to the Labor Council of New South Wales, becoming first an organiser and in 1975 becoming Secretary. In 1972 he was appointed a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. He was also President of the New South Wales Labor Party and vice-president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. In these positions he supported successive New South Wales Labor leaders such as Pat Hills, Neville Wran and Barrie Unsworth (also a Catholic convert). In 1973 he was the main organiser of the leadership coup which replaced Hills as leader with Wran, who went on to become Premier of New South Wales for ten years. Ducker was also a powerful supporter of Federal Labor Leader Gough Whitlam in his battles with the left wing of the Labor Party during the 1960s. In 1970 Ducker was a leading figure in the internal crisis in the Labor Party that cemented Whitlam's leadership. Convinced of the need to remove the left-wing controllers of the Victorian branch of the party if Labor was to win the 1972 federal election, Ducker did a deal with the left-wing leader Clyde Cameron, under which the right shared power with the left in the New South Wales branch in exchange for Cameron's support for the reform of the Victorian branch. He had a long association with Mater Maria Catholic College In 1979 Ducker's health declined and he resigned all his official positions, but Wran appointed him Chairman of the New South Wales Public Service Board. He remained a powerful influence behind the scenes, supporting younger Labor leaders such as Graham Richardson, Bob Carr and Paul Keating. He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1979, and the Catholic Church awarded him a Papal knighthood. He was also appointed to several company boards, including Qantas and the poker machine giant Aristocrat Leisure Industries."

He was educated at a grammar school before going on to Cambridge University where he read History at Trinity Hall. He then became a journalist at the Newcastle Journal, before moving to London as industrial, and later diplomatic, correspondent of the Scotsman. In 1971, Tilley was elected to Wandsworth Council, where he became council leader. He was selected as Labour candidate to fight Kensington in the February 1974 and October 1974 elections, with improving results but no success. The party chose him to defend at a by-election its long-standing high majority in Lambeth Central in 1978, which he won. The election was triggered by a caused by a Labour MP's death, Marcus Lipton. In Parliament, he served on Labour's opposition front bench, resigning in 1982 in opposition to the Party leadership's stand on the Falklands War. As MP for the Brixton area, he worked with Lord Scarman after the 1981 Brixton Riots for a better understanding of local social problems. He proposed a bill to amend the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 to make rape in marriage illegal in 1983. Tilley was a founding member of the Socialist Campaign Group in 1982, but his constituency seat was abolished for the 1983 election and he was selected to fight Southwark and Bermondsey instead. The seat had been safe Labour but Simon Hughes had won the constituency for the Liberal Party in a by-election earlier that year, and Hughes kept the seat in the general election. Tilley never returned to Parliament. Tilley subsequently worked as chief economic adviser to the London Borough of Hackney and 11 years as parliamentary secretary to the Co-operative Union. From 2000 to 2002, he headed the parliamentary office of the Co-operative Group. An active co-operator, he wrote Churchill's Favourite Socialist: A Life of AV Alexander, a biography of an earlier co-operative activist and Member of Parliament, created a peer for his life work, A. V. Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Hillsborough. Tilley's first marriage ended in divorce, after a daughter, Cleo. He married again in 1982 to Kathryn Riley, a Brixton teacher and Labour activist, later professor at the University of London's Institute of Education. They had a daughter Jo. Tilley died of cancer in 2005."

  "text" : "James A. McClinton (born 1961) is a Kansas politician, originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and former mayor of Topeka, Kansas who served only a portion of his term from January 2004 to April 2005. He was appointed by the city council to replace Butch Felker, who resigned amid a campaign finance scandal (Duane Pomeroy served as acting mayor from November to December 2003). McClinton had previously served on the city council from 1991 to 1993 and from 1997 to 2001. He is a member of the Democratic Party. James McClinton was born in Milwaukee, then moved to Helena, Arkansas in early childhood, and then finally to Topeka. After graduating from Washburn Rural High School, he attended Washburn University where he received a Minor degree in psychology, an Associate's degree in mental health and a Bachelor's degree in criminal justice. He received his Master's degree in public administration from the University of Kansas with honors. McClinton's short stint as mayor is significant for its firsts and lasts. He was the first African-American mayor of Topeka and the first mayor to be appointed by the city council (he was chosen from a field of 40 candidates by the city council). However, he was also the last mayor to serve the city with full authority as the populace subsequently voted in a referendum for council-manager form of government in 2004 which stripped the mayor position of most of his or her powers. Instead, a new city manager and the city council would hold non-ceremonial power (the decision to include this initiative on the 2004 ballot was made prior to the appointment of McClinton, possibly in reaction to Felker's alleged abuses). In 2004, McClinton decided against running for a full term as a \"ceremonial\" mayor. During his time as mayor, Topeka celebrated its 150th anniversary. The city was also honored by a visit from George W. Bush, Stephen Breyer and John Kerry, celebrating the anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision which ended racial segregation in schools and the renovated Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site. Mayor McClinton created a large diverse group of community leaders and charged them to create a Riverfront Development Plan. He submitted that plan to the city council prior to leaving office. The Riverfront Plan was approved by the council, received approval by the Kansas Legislature, and signed into law by former Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius. Mayor McClinton created new community development strategies to revitalize the inner city, his new program received a Regional Award from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. McClinton, along with other national mayors collaborated with the White House to eradicate homelessness in 10 years. Through mayor McClinton's leadership, the City of Topeka was recognized with several \"Best Practices\" citations. Mayor McClinton created a partnership with the University of Kansas to forgive tuition for students who returned to the community and committed to community service. After leaving office in 2005, Mayor McClinton worked with a local developer in several states revitalizing inner cities. In 2007, Mayor McClinton moved to the Dallas area. McClinton is now CEO of McClinton Consulting and also manages two federally funded housing programs. McClinton is the father of two daughters, Jameika and Tawana."

Son of Prime Minister John Miller Andrews, he was educated at Moure Grange Preparatory School, County Down, and Shrewsbury School. Andrews entered Parliament as MP for Mid Down in 1953 (replacing his father), a seat which he represented until his resignation in 1964, when he was elected to the Senate where he sat until the Parliament was prorogued in 1972. His election to the senate was following a cabinet reshuffle, in which Andrews accepted demotion to the politically unimportant position of Government Minister in the Senate. He held several Cabinet positions, including Minister in the Senate from 1964 and Deputy Prime Minister from May 1969. He was a contender for the position of Prime Minister on the retirement of Lord Brookeborough, but when it became clear that Terence O'Neill had a comfortable lead over both Andrews and Brian Faulkner in the parliamentary party, no contest was held. In 1969 he was approached by O'Neill to succeed him, but he refused and James Chichester-Clark was elected During the 1970 Bannside and South Antrim by-elections, Andrews was at the centre of the UUP's pluralist campaign against Ian Paisley's Protestant Unionist Party, declaring \"What does Protestant Unionism mean? Does it mean that you have to put a sign over the door of the Unionist Party saying Protestants only?\" Andrews was knighted in 1973. In retirement, he served as President of the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland."

  "text" : "Sir James Sexton CBE (13 April 1856 – 27 December 1938) was a British trade unionist and politician. Sexton was born in Newcastle upon Tyne to an Irish-born family of market traders, who soon moved to St Helens, Lancashire. After leaving school he worked in a variety of jobs, including as a seaman and in a chemical factory, before becoming a docker on Liverpool Docks. In 1884 he set up his own business as a coal merchant. In 1889 he joined the new National Union of Dock Labourers (later National Union of Dock, Riverside and General Workers) and was elected General Secretary in 1893, defeating James Larkin. He held this post until the union joined the Transport and General Workers' Union in 1922, whereupon he became National Supervisor of the Docks Trade Group of the new union. He retired from the TGWU in 1928. A founder member of the Independent Labour Party, he later joined the Labour Party. He stood unsuccessfully for Liverpool Toxteth in 1905 and then served as Labour Member of Parliament for St Helens from 1918 to 1931. He also sat on Liverpool City Council from 1905 until his death. Up to 1930 Sexton was elected for the St Anne's ward then was replaced by Bessie Braddock before becoming an alderman. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1917 and knighted in 1931. In 1934 he was granted the freedom of the City of Liverpool."

In October 2003 he was elected borough mayor, defeating the incumbent, fellow Republican Rhonda Boyles. Whitaker was reelected in 2006 with over 77% of the vote. As mayor, Whitaker was known for supporting spending on quality of life services such as parks and recreation, as well as spearheading a campaign to prevent a drastic reduction in the operations of Eielson Air Force Base due to federal budget cuts. Whitaker endorsed Democrat Barack Obama in the 2008 United States presidential election and spoke during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Many member of the state GOP expressed ill feelings about the decision, with one former state senator accusing him of being a Republican In Name Only. Whitaker's endorsement of Obama was notable as the mayor of the second-largest metropolitan area in Alaska, the home state of 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who was nominated by John McCain after the Democratic convention. In 2009, Whitaker endorsed Democrat Luke Hopkins to be his successor as mayor. Hopkins won the election in a runoff on November 3 and succeeded Whitaker on November 16, 2009. In 2014, Whitaker was selected to be Governor Bill Walker's Chief of Staff."

In 1981, he was among the Labour MPs who defected to the Social Democratic Party. At the 1983 general election, he lost his seat by just 920 votes to the Conservative David Evennett. After his defection, he was referred to as \"the inappropriately named Wellbeloved\" by then Labour leader Michael Foot. Wellbeloved subsequently rejoined the Labour Party as a member.

Barr was Member of Parliament (MP) for Motherwell, from 1924 to 1931 and then for Coatbridge from 1935 to 1945. He was Chairman of the Select Committee on Capital Punishment, 1929–1930 which reported at the end of the latter year. In 1930-1931 he was Chairman of the Liaison Committee, as the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party was then known at any time when the party was in government. A Presbyterian minister, Barr strongly opposed any link between Church and State; in his view, the Church must support and maintain itself on an entirely voluntary basis. For this reason, he was a prominent member of the United Free Church of Scotland and he led the opposition to that group's reunion with the Church of Scotland in 1929; he and those of like mind did not participate in the re-union and continued as the United Free Church of Scotland, which is still in existence. His maiden speech as an MP was an attack on the Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925 and lasted just under an hour and a half. Barr was the grandfather of James Barr (biblical scholar)."

He subsequently moved to the town of Oldham, becoming secretary of the Oldham Weavers' Association in 1905, a post he held for 41 years. He was the first president of the Oldham Labour Party, and attempted to gain election to the Borough Council without success. In 1918 he was elected as member of parliament for Ormskirk, the first non Conservative to be elected for this seat since its creation in 1885. This was principally due to a divided Conservative vote between the Coalition Conservatives and the candidate of the National Farmers Union. Bell served only one term in parliament, losing his seat at the next election in 1922. He continued his union activities: in 1924 he was appointed secretary of the International Federation of Textile Workers' Associations, and was subsequently secretary of the United Textile Factory Workers Association, and in 1930 took part in a trade mission to China. He died, aged 83, in an Oldham hospital in 1955."

  "text" : "John Davies Ormond (1831 – 6 October 1917) was a New Zealand politician whose positions included Superintendent of Hawke's Bay Province, Minister of Public Works and member of the New Zealand Legislative Council. He represented the Clive electorate in Parliament from 1861 to 1881, when he was defeated (standing for the electorate of Waipawa). He then represented the Napier electorate from 1884 to 1890, when he retired. He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 20 January 1891 and served until his death on 6 October 1917. He was appointed to the Council as one of seven new members (including Harry Atkinson himself) appointed to the Council by the outgoing fourth Atkinson Ministry; a move regarded by Liberals as a stacking of the upper house against the new government. Ormond was baptised on 28 June 1831. He came from Wallingford, Oxfordshire, (then Berkshire), England, and established a homestead called Wallingford in Central Hawke's Bay in 1847, which became a major farming station. Businessman and farmer Sir John Ormond, politician and farmer Tiaki Omana, and politician and Historic Places Trust chairman Ormond Wilson were his grandsons. His brother-in-law and husband of his sister was the Governor of Jamaica, Edward John Eyre. His second great-granddaughter is the Headmistress, Ormond Felicity Lusk. He married Hannah Richardson on 4 December 1860, the sister of George Edward Gordon Richardson. He died on 6 October 1917 at his home 'Tintagel' in Napier."

At the age of 27 the Miner's Union sent him to Ruskin College, Oxford where he obtained, with distinction, a Diploma in Economics and Political Science. He then resumed his career in the coal mining industry as a Checkweighman. McKay was elected as Member of Parliament for Wallsend at the 1945 general election, and was re-elected at four subsequent elections until his retirement at the 1964 general election, where he was succeeded by Ted Garrett. He was made a Freeman of the Borough of Wallsend on 25 April 1963, an honour shared with Aneurin Bevan, who was granted it on 18 October 1952."

  "text" : "Jeffrey Hardee \"Jeff\" Atwater (born April 8, 1958) is currently the Chief Financial Officer of Florida. He is a Republican . Atwater moved to Florida at the age of 4 and grew up in North Palm Beach, Florida, where his father, a veteran World War II pilot and FBI agent, served as police chief. He went on to gain substantial experience in banking, and was elected to the North Palm Beach Village Council in 1993. Later, he served as chairman, president, and CEO of the Barnett Bank of Broward County and the Treasure Coast, and later as market president of Riverside National Bank for Palm Beach and Broward counties. In 2000, Atwater ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 83rd District, defeating Democratic nominee Pam Dunston and independent Michael I. Danchuk. After just two years in the House, he ran for the Florida Senate from the 25th District, which included Palm Beach and Broward counties. Unopposed in the primary election, Atwater faced off against long-serving Democratic Attorney General of Florida Bob Butterworth in the general election, and, aided by then-Governor Jeb Bush's strong performance that year, defeated Butterworth by a solid margin. He was re-elected in 2004 with no opposition, and again in 2008, when he defeated Democrat Linda Bird, a realtor. From 2008 to 2010, he was the president of the Florida Senate. Following the decision by then-Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink to run for governor rather than seek re-election, Atwater jumped into the race to succeed Sink. In the general election, Atwater faced off against former State Representative Loranne Ausley, whom he defeated, 57.3 to 38.9. Though considered as a frontrunner, in April 2015, he declined to run for the US Senate seat Marco Rubio is expected to vacate before the Senate elections, 2016 to run for the US Presidency. Atwater has since changed his mind, stating that he may run in the upcoming 2016 Senate election."

He served in the 2nd Life Guards, rising to the rank of commissioned cornet in 1847, lieutenant in 1849 and captain in 1854. In 1856 he was appointed major in the Queen’s Own Royal Glasgow and Lower Ward of Lanarkshire Yeomanry Cavalry. Although retiring from the regular Army in 1860, he continued to serve in the Yeomanry until 1885. He began his political career in 1857 as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Falkirk Burghs, serving for two years. He later sat for Lanarkshire South in 1868–74 and 1880–86. He also served as a Justice of the Peace, and as Deputy Lieutenant and Vice-Lord Lieutenant for Lanarkshire. In 1886, Hamilton was raised to the peerage as Baron Hamilton of Dalzell. He served in William Ewart Gladstone's government as a Lord-in-Waiting from 1892 to 1894. The Hamiltons made large amounts of money in the nineteenth century, as the lands they held in Lanarkshire were sold for coal exploitation. In the late 1850s and 1860s Hamilton was able to greatly extend his home of Dalzell House, a former tower house outside Motherwell, laying out landscaped grounds at the same time. In 1864 he married Lady Emily Leslie-Melville (died 1882), daughter of David Leslie-Melville, 8th Earl of Leven, and had issue: 1."

  "text" : "John Milton Worth served as North Carolina State Treasurer from 1876 to 1885. He was the younger brother of Jonathan Worth, who served as the state's Treasurer and Governor during the 1860s. John Worth served several terms in the North Carolina Senate, representing Moore and Montgomery Counties in the 1840s. Like his older brother, he was a Unionist or Anti-Secessionist, until the war broke out, when he became loyal to the southern cause, serving as an officer in the Confederate military reserves. In 1870, he was elected state Senator from Randolph County. In November 1876, Worth was elected by the people to a four-year term as State Treasurer. His name added strength to the ticket and is credited with helping his fellow Democrats regain power in the State. When incumbent Republican David A. Jenkins resigned before the end of his term, Governor Curtis H. Brogden named Worth to fill the post a few months early. As Treasurer, he faced up to the difficult task of settling the State's debt on a fair and equitable basis to both the bond holders and the citizens of the State. Worth was re-elected Treasurer in 1880, serving just over four more years. He served the State well, with honor, integrity and capability and was highly respected for his service. He is quoted as once commenting upon his guiding philosophy, saying, \"My earnest wish has been to be useful to the State.\" After leaving public service, Worth became president of the Bank of Randolph and of the Southern Stock Mutual Fire Insurance Company. His Worth Manufacturing Company operated successful cotton mills in Worthville and Central Falls in Randolph County, not far from where the North Carolina Zoological Park is located today. By the time of his death in 1900 at age 90, he had become one of the State's wealthiest citizens."

Born in Calgary, Jack Leslie received his primary and secondary school education in Calgary and attended the University of Alberta. With the outbreak of war, he left his studies in Edmonton and joined the Royal Canadian Air Force. He saw four years service as a pilot. Following the war, he obtained his A.A.C.I. degree from the Appraisal Institute of Canada and began to pursue a career in real estate. In 1962, he ran for City Council and was elected as the representative for Ward 4. Jack Leslie served four years as an Alderman. He was instrumental in establishing the School Board Liaison Committee; led a successful fight to keep the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks off the banks of the Bow River; developed Nose Hill and confederation Parks; helped achieve \"International\" Airport status for Calgary; established the Airport Authority. Leslie was elected Mayor in 1965; he was the first native Calgarian to be elected mayor. During his tenure, major low-cost housing schemes were undertaken in several areas of the city, including Urban Renewal efforts; the Palliser Square project was completed and the transformation of Prince's Island into one of the city's beauty spots was begun. He also assisted in making Deerfoot Trail a safer road by implementing plans for proper intersections and cloverleafs. Since returning to private life, Leslie has resumed his real estate appraisal business and lived in Calgary with his wife, the former Jean Logan, whom he married in 1942."

  "text" : "James Williamson, 1st Baron Ashton (31 December 1842 – 27 May 1930) was a British businessman and Liberal Party politician, whose family business in Lancaster produced oilcloth and linoleum which was exported around the world. He was born the third of four surviving children to James Williamson Snr, who had established a successful coated fabrics business in the town in the 1840s. James jnr was educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School and worked all his life in the family business. With his father he created the city's Williamson Park, on the site of former stone quarries on Lancaster moor. After the death of his second wife, Jessie, who supported him in his political life, he built the Ashton Memorial on a hill in the park; the Edwardian baroque building is now used for exhibitions and for weddings. He also donated the city's Town Hall and a monument to Queen Victoria in the city's Dalton Square. He bought Ashton Hall in 1884, serving as High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1885. In the 1886 general election, Williamson was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Lancaster, and held his seat at the 1892 election. In 1895 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Ashton, of Ashton in the County Palatine of Lancaster and in 1920 made Constable of Lancaster Castle for life. He married three times; firstly to Margaret Gatey in 1869, with whom he had two daughters, secondly to Jessie Hulme in 1880 and thirdly to Florence Whalley, later Lady Ashton, in 1909, who survived him. His elder daughter Maud died unmarried at the age of 30 and his younger daughter Ella married Viscount Peel in 1899."

  "text" : "John W. Lavelle (January 26, 1949 – January 24, 2007) formerly represented the 61st Assembly District in the New York State Assembly, which comprises much of the North Shore of Staten Island. Lavelle, a former executive with Met Life, was a champion for the poor and less fortunate. He served as a member of the New York State Charter Commission for Staten Island in 1993, and became Staten Island Democratic Party Chairman in 1999. He was first elected to the New York State Assembly in 2000, filling the seat formerly occupied by Assemblywoman Betty Connelly. He served on a number of committees, including Government Employees, Social Services, Veterans Affairs and Mental Health, among others. Assemblyman Lavelle was known for sponsoring bills calling for the same benefits of those who died in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing as those who died in the 2001 attack and for being an advocate for stronger gun control laws. In addition, Lavelle spent over 20 years working for quality health care by serving on the Community Advisory Board for the Sisters of Charity Health Care System at St. Vincent's Medical Center. He started a monthly recreation program for patients at Sea View Hospital Rehabilitation Center and Home and served as Chairman of the Center's Advisory Board. He has also helped substance abusers get their lives back on track by serving as vice chair of the Camelot Counseling Center's Board of Directors. Lavelle suffered a stroke on January 19, 2007 and died in a coma on January 24, just two days short of his 58th birthday. Lavelle is survived by his three sons and four grandchildren. To honor his death and to allow members of the New York State Assembly to attend his funeral, Speaker of the New York State Assembly Sheldon Silver canceled the session of the Assembly for January 28, 2007. The funeral service was attended by over 1,000 people and included the Governor of the State of New York Eliot Spitzer, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, candidates for New York State Comptroller, over 50 Assemblymembers, and all of the elected officials from Staten Island from both political parties. His seat was filled by special election, with fellow Democrat Matthew Titone elected to succeed him in the Assembly."

  "text" : "Jack C. Voight (born December 17, 1945) is a Wisconsin insurance agent and a former State Treasurer of Wisconsin. He is a member of the Republican Party. Born and raised in New London, Wisconsin, Voight received his Bachelor of Science from the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh in 1971. After serving as an Army sergeant from 1968–70, he moved to Appleton, Wisconsin, where he established an insurance agency. Voight served on the Appleton City Council from 1983–1993, holding the position of council president from 1992 - 1993. When incumbent Treasurer Cathy Zeuske ran in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in 1994, Voight ran as the Republican nominee to replace her. He was elected that year, and re-elected in 1998 and 2002. He was defeated for re-election on November 7, 2006, by Democrat Dawn Marie Sass, a former parole officer and AFSCME union activist, now working as a clerk at the department store Boston Store, in what was considered an upset. Voight had defeated Sass in both 1998 and 2002, and Sass said she spent less than $4000 on the race, most out of her own pocket. Voight held the position of president of the National Association of State Treasurers in 1997. In May 2009, Voight announced his interest in seeking the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin in 2010, but instead, the following June Voight announced he was going to run to replace retiring Outagamie County Executive Toby Paltzer. On April 5, 2011, he was defeated by former Assemblyman and unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor Tom Nelson, by roughly 52% - 48%. Voight blamed the political unrest stemming from Governor Scott Walker's policy drive to eliminate public workers' collective bargaining powers, saying \"The labor movement has not only energized the Democratic Party base but a lot of the independents.\""

  "text" : "Jonathan Sewall (August 24, 1729 – September 27, 1796) was the last British attorney general of Massachusetts. He was born in Boston on August 24, 1729 to Jonathan and Mary (Payne) Sewall. Sewall's father was an unsuccessful merchant who died at a young age. However through scholarships, funds raised by his pastor William Cooper and with the help of his uncle, Chief Justice Stephen Sewall, Sewall was able to attend Harvard. Sewall graduated from Harvard College in 1748, and was a teacher in Salem until 1756. He married Esther Quincy, a daughter of merchant Edmund Quincy. After studying law, he began a successful practice in Charlestown and served as attorney general of Massachusetts from 1767 to 1775. In 1768 he was also appointed Judge of Admiralty for Nova Scotia. In 1759 Sewall became a very close friend and patron of John Adams, the future second President of the United States. At the urging of Governor Francis Bernard, Sewall offered Adams the position of Advocate General in the Admiralty Court. Adams declined. A devout Loyalist, Sewall took his family to England in 1775 after a mob stormed his family home in Cambridge (he was subsequently named in the Massachusetts Banishment Act of 1778). Adams, in his diary, grieved that his best friend in the world had become his implacable enemy. While Adams was assigned to London as a U.S. minister to the Court of St. James's in 1785, he looked up his old friend and they had a two-hour meeting. Both men were entrenched in their own ideas and no reconciliation was possible; Adams considered Sewall a casualty of the war. Sewall later served as a judge in the Vice Admiralty Court of Nova Scotia. He died in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1796. His son Jonathan later served as Chief Justice of Lower Canada and his son Stephen served as solicitor general for Lower Canada."

The family was Nonconformist in religion and Liberal in politics. John Cheetham served as MP for South Lancashire and later Salford. During the Lancashire Cotton Famine in 1861-4, Cheetham rose to prominence as President of the Cotton Supply Association: a body that aimed to promote the growth and export of raw cotton outside the US and particularly in the British Raj. As the US cotton supply returned however, Cheetham's frequent attacks on the governance of the Raj gradually caused opinion in Britain and India to turn against the Association, and it dissolved in 1872. His son John Frederick Cheetham was MP for North Derbyshire and later for Stalybridge."

  "text" : "J. Batty Langley (20 March 1834 – 19 February 1914) was a British Liberal Party politician. Born in Uppingham, Langley became a wealthy timber merchant in Sheffield, and one of the city's most prominent non-conformists. He was elected to Sheffield Town Council, serving many years and becoming an alderman. In 1892, Langley became Mayor of Sheffield, and saw an eventful year in office. Sheffield became a city, while Langley organised a conference in the city, aiming to settle the 1893 UK coal strike. Claiming to represent the interests of the working class, he was elected as the Member of Parliament at the Sheffield Attercliffe by-election, 1894. As an employer, he was a controversial choice, and the Independent Labour Party stood a candidate against him. Langley became the first President of the General Union of Railway Clerks in 1897, although he resigned due to ill health the following year. He retained his Parliamentary seat until he retired in 1909."

  "text" : "John Roderick Dahmer (September 5, 1937 – November 26, 1988) was elected a member of the Canadian House of Commons in 1988. His background was in education. A school teacher, guidance councillor, principal, and later involved in adult education, correctional education and vocational training as a director at Lakeland College. He was elected in the 1988 federal election at the Beaver River electoral district for the Progressive Conservative party; however, he was terminally stricken with pancreatic cancer and never saw the first day of the 34th Canadian Parliament. Dahmer had entered Edmonton's Royal Alexandra Hospital on October 28, 1988, after suffering symptoms similar to adult onset type two diabetes, but the extent of his condition was not widely known until after election night. However, by the time cancer was discovered it was after the deadline to withdraw from the general election, and at that point it was not certain the cancer could not be successfully treated with chemotherapy. Dahmer died five days after the election, before the Deputy Clerk of the House of Commons could arrive to conduct a swearing-in ceremony. Despite this, parliamentary policy allowed Dahmer's widow to receive a $29,150 severance, which was equivalent to six months salary in office. This money was used to establish the John Dahmer Community Involvement Scholarship at Lakeland College. As of 2016, he continues to hold the record for the shortest term as a federal Member of Parliament in Canadian history."

  "text" : "Joan V. Hartley is an American politician. Hartley, a Democrat, has been a state senator from Connecticut since 2001. Hartley, a resident of Waterbury, represents the western half of the city as well as its southern suburbs of Naugatuck and Prospect in the Connecticut Senate. Hartley was born in Waterbury and graduated from Elms College and received a M.A. from Trinity College. Prior to being elected to the Connecticut Senate, Hartley served as a Connecticut state representative representing the 73rd District from 1984 to 2000. Hartley's predecessor as a state representative was future Governor John G. Rowland. Perhaps as a result, Hartley is generally considered among the more conservative and bipartisan members of the Democratic caucus. In 2007 she was believed to be the sole holdout from the strategy of Senate President Donald E. Williams, Jr. to override Governor M. Jodi Rell's veto of a Democratic state bonding package. Rell had vetoed the package claiming it put the state too far into debt. Hartley opposed a billion dollar commitment to the Connecticut State University system and has been threatened with retribution from Democratic party leadership. On October 30 an agreement was reached between the Rell Administration, legislative Democratic leaders and Senator Hartley to resolve the bonding stalemate. The final bonding package was reduced by $400 million from the level vetoed by Rell and increased oversight was placed on funds for the Connecticut State University system. The Courant later reported that pressure was placed on fellow senators against Hartley by Senator Thomas Gaffey, who had an undisclosed intimate relationship with the lobbyist for the university system. In December 2008, Hartley was removed as the Chairman of the Higher Education Committee because of her independence and willingness to stand up to the Democratic leadership who was shielding Gaffey. In 2008, Hartley was one of three Democrats who supported Governor M. Jodi Rell's proposal for a Three Strikes Law against career violent criminals. In 2009, Hartley was the only Democrat in the State Senate that did not vote to override Governor M. Jodi Rell's veto of the Healthcare Partnership bill, thereby preventing the bill from becoming law. In 2011, Hartley and Paul Doyle were the only two Democrats to vote against transgender rights legislation."

From 1946 onwards the family lived at Hedworth View in a three-bedroomed council house. As well his elected status, Joe held many other offices during his lifetime, including Councillor and Mayor of Jarrow, and Chair of the National Housing Committee. He was awarded the O.B.E. for services to the disabled and was a strong influence in the building of the Tyne Tunnel crossing in preference to a bridge, the construction of which would have required the demolition of many good quality council houses."

At the 1918 general election, he was elected as MP for the new Smethwick constituency on the outskirts of Birmingham. It was an unusual electoral contest: there was no Conservative Party or Liberal Party candidate, and his only opponent was Christabel Pankhurst of the Women's Party, who was supported by the alliance of the Conservative Party and the David Lloyd George-led Coalition Liberal faction. Davison won the seat with a majority of only 775 votes, and was returned to the House of Commons at the 1922 general election with a margin of only 382 votes over his only opponent, a Conservative. He was re-elected by more comfortable margins at the 1923 general election and at the 1924 general election, but resigned his seat in 1926. The resulting by-election on 21 December 1926, was won by the Labour candidate Oswald Mosley, who went on to found the New Party and the British Union of Fascists. Davison died in March 1927, aged 56."

He was first elected as the constituency's MP at a by-election in March 1929, caused by the death of the Conservative MP Arthur Dean. At the time he was managing director of a boot manufacturing business. Blindell overturned a Conservative majority of nearly 5,000 to win with a majority of 3,706. His victory was the last Liberal by-election gain until Torrington in 1958. Blindell was re-elected as a Liberal at the 1929 general election, but in 1931 he was one of the Liberal MPs who broke with their party to support Ramsay MacDonald's National Government, eventually forming the National Liberal Party. He was re-elected as a National Liberal at the 1931 general election and at the 1935 general election. In both elections, the Conservatives (who also supported the National Government) did not field a candidate against him, and he was returned with large majorities. Blindell was knighted in 1936, and died in office in 1937. At the consequent Holland with Boston by-election, 1937, Herbert Butcher held the seat for the National Liberals."

  "text" : "John Samuel Potts (12 August 1861 – 28 April 1938) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom who served a Member of Parliament (MP) for twelve years between 1922 and 1938. Born in Bolton, Lancashire, Potts had started work at Durham Colliery at the age of eleven. He was a checkweighman at the Hemsworth Colliery, Yorkshire, for 25 years. At the Barnsley by-election of 1897 Potts supported the Liberal Party-candidate Joseph Walton. While chairing a Liberal election meeting during this by-election, Potts said in the presence of Walton that he would favour a labour party at a time when state payment of MPs, and of official election expenses would enable working men to be maintained in Parliament. But until then, \"the Liberal party was the working man’s only hope\". In 1905, Potts switched sides, and started working with the Independent Labour Party against Walton, and the leadership of the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA). Ten years later Potts was elected as treasurer of the YMA, and became a member of the executive committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. He kept these positions until he was elected as MP for Barnsley at the 1922 general election, when payment of MPs and election expenses had been enacted. Potts held the seat at three further elections in the 1920s. When Labour split at the 1931 general election over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of a National Government, he narrowly lost his seat to the National Liberal candidate Richard John Soper. Potts was comfortably re-elected at the 1935 general election, but died in office in 1938, in Barnsley, aged 76. His illness and death have been connected with the shock he received when the Wharncliffe Woodmoor Pit Disaster occurred two years earlier. His home was in the lane which led to the colliery."

He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Ogmore at a by-election in 1946, but stood down at the 1950 general election. John Evans, a fluent Welsh speaker, was elected MP for Ogmore in 1946, following a by-election, caused by the resignation of Ted Williams who had been appointed as high commissioner to Australia. It was said by many that at 70 years of age he was too old for the job but it is well to remember that Winston Churchill became prime minister for the second time at 76 and remained an MP into his eighties. John Evans was born at Cwmparc in the Rhondda Valley in September 1875 and attended the local Park Board School. He started work at twelve years of age in the local colliery where he remained for the next 20 years before winning a place at Ruskin College. On his return he became union secretary at Coegnant colliery, Maesteg. By now he was living at Nantyffyllon. He was elected to Maesteg UDC (1916–37) and Glamorgan CC in (1913–46). In 1929 he stood unsuccessfully for parliament in Montgomery and in 1931 he failed to get the nomination for Ogmore losing out to Ted Williams.Surprisingly, as the sitting MP, he failed to gain the nomination, from the Ogmore Labour Party, for the 1950 General Election, despite being steeped in mining tradition and Welsh Culture. Newcomer Walter Padley gained the nomination and went on to be the MP for the next 30 years. Shortly after his non-selection, John Evans moved to Tongwynlais near Cardiff and from there won a seat on Glamorgan CC in 1952, at the grand age of 75. He died in 1961, aged 85."

Lee, a driver for Virgin Trains, stood as a BNP candidate in the 2002 local elections in Bexley and was subsequently expelled from the train drivers' union ASLEF for BNP membership. In May 2003, an Employment Tribunal ruled that Lee had been wrongly expelled from the union, finding ASLEF had breached section 174 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act. On 24 January 2004, the decision was overturned by an Employment Appeal Tribunal, which referred the case back to a new tribunal. On 7 October 2004, the new tribunal ruled in Lee's favour, awarding him at least £5,000. Lee also sued for libel after he was described as a racist, seeking aggravated damages from two senior trade unionists and two journalists. In January 2006, ASLEF paid £30,000 in an out-of-court settlement to cover Lee's legal costs in the libel case, but Lee did not receive any personal damages. ASLEF subsequently took the UK Government to the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that UK law was in breach of Article 11 (freedom of assembly and association) of the European Convention on Human Rights. On 27 February 2007, the Court unanimously upheld ASLEF's claim that there had been a violation of the Convention and that ASLEF was entitled to expel Lee from the union. Lee was represented at the Employment Tribunal by Lee Barnes (the BNP \"legal officer\") and in the libel case by Adrian Davies. Jay Lee left the BNP in 2010 due to disagreements with the Nick Griffin leadership. He had been a member for 18 years in total."

In 1921 he was one of six Sinn Féin candidates elected unopposed to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland for Donegal. Again he did not attend and instead participated in the Second Dáil. In 1922 he was re-elected as a Pro-Treaty Sinn Féin candidate for Donegal and participated in the Third Dáil. Sweeney was born in Burtonport, a town in The Rosses, a district in the north-west of County Donegal. He received his secondary education at St. Enda's School in Rathfarnham, where Patrick Pearse was Headmaster. He served as a Major-General in the National Army during the Irish Civil War in the early 1920s. Having spent most of his life in Dublin, he died in 1980 aged 83."

Tyler was an early parliamentary candidate for the Ecology Party, in the Walsall North by-election, 1976, at a time when he was a transport lecturer at the University of Birmingham. He was the Ecology Party's Chairman for some years from 1976. Tyler would later go on to stand as a candidate in local elections. During the 1980s he was associated with attempts by the 'Maingreen' group to streamline the Green Party's internal workings. He subsequently left the Green Party, but rejoined some years later. Tyler joined British Rail as a Traffic Apprentice in 1962. He became a British Rail-sponsored university lecturer and since 2000 has run a consultancy called Passenger Transport Networks. He has specialised in making the case for the importance of integrated strategic timetabling, drawing in particular on the Swiss Taktfahrplan methodology. The Taktfahrplan is based on repeating hourly cycles where trains meet at hubs around symmetry minutes (normally xx.00 and xx.30) to optimise connections in all directions. To create an optimal 'Taktfahrplan' system, infrastructure must be designed with the network timetable in mind. The 'Taktfahrplan' aims to create notions of convenience and accessibility to encourage people to use public transport. Tyler has argued for a National Timetabling Authority to plan an integrated strategic timetable. Tyler has critiqued High Speed 2 from a \"green\" perspective  and has written about the implications a \"green\" agenda should have for railway timetabling He chaired the York Environment Forum until 2010. He is now a member of York Green Party and was the party's Parliamentary Candidate for York Central in 2015 winning 10% of the vote."

He represented York West in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1886 to 1894 as a Liberal member. He was born in Clarke Township, Durham County, Canada West in 1855, the son of Thomas Gilmour. He studied in Port Hope and at Trinity College in Toronto, receiving an M.D.. He set up practice in King Township, moving to Toronto Junction in 1884 where he served as surgeon for the Canadian Pacific Railway from 1885 to 1894. He established the Junction's first weekly newspaper, the York Tribune and served as its editor for two years. He also served as chairman of the high school board for Toronto Junction, and in this capacity was instrumental in the town acquiring its first high school which later became Humberside Collegiate Institute. Following his stint in politics, Gilmour became active in prison reform, being named warden for the Central Prison at Toronto in 1896, a position he left to become Warden of the Ontario Reformatory at Guelph. At the time of his death he was the Ontario Parole Commissioner, and had the distinction of being the only Canadian prison official ever to serve as president of the American Prison Association (as Canada did not yet have its own prison association)."

Previously, Roth served as one of three members of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission from June 2007 through January 2009. He had been appointed to the seat by Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry. Prior to his statewide positions, Roth had served as an Oklahoma County Commissioner, a post to which he had been elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006. Born in Prairie Village, Kansas, Roth attended Shawnee Mission East High School, Kansas State University, and Oklahoma City University School of Law. He then went on to work as a Chief Deputy and Attorney to the Oklahoma County Commission and the Oklahoma County Clerk. Roth is openly gay and was the first ever openly LGBT person to hold a statewide elected office in Oklahoma. In his bid to serve out the last two years of the corporation commission term to which he'd been appointed, Roth was defeated 52%-48% by Republican Dana Murphy. Roth recently endorsed the MAPS 3 proposal on the December 8, 2009 ballot in Oklahoma City."

  "text" : "James C. Welsh (2 June 1880 – 4 November 1954) was a miner, trade unionist, novelist and Scottish Labour Party politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1922 to 1931, and from 1935 to 1945. Welsh worked in mines from the age of 12, an experience which informed his first novels The Underworld (1920) and The Morlocks (1924). He later became a full-time official for the mining union. He unsuccessfully contested the 1918 general election in the Lanark constituency. At the 1922 general election, he was elected as MP for Coatbridge constituency, where he was re-elected in 1923, 1924 and 1929, but was defeated at the 1931 general election by the Conservative Party candidate William Paterson Templeton. He was returned to the House of Commons at the 1935 general election as MP for Bothwell, and held the seat until he stepped down at the 1945 general election."

  "text" : "Joseph Lynn Leicester (24 December 1825 – 13 October 1903) was an English glass blower and Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1886. Born in Warrington, he was the son of Thomas Leicester, a glassblower. At the age of nine, Leicester was apprenticed to his father's trade. In 1850 he moved to Lambeth in London, and was employed for 35 years as a glass-blower by James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars, London. Soon after his arrival in the capital he was appointed secretary of the Glassmakers Trade Society, a position he held for more than forty years. He was sent by the Society of Arts to report upon glass at the Paris Exhibitions in 1867 and 1868. The Society awarded him three first-class prizes for art and in 1870 the Glass Blowers' Society of Great Britain and Ireland presented him with £100 in recognition of his services to the trade. He was a strong temperance advocate, and was in favour of Sunday closing of public houses. In the 1885 general election, Leicester was elected Member of Parliament for West Ham South but in the 1886 general election, he was defeated by the Conservative candidate. He made four contributions during his year in parliament. At the 1892 general election he was again chosen to contest the West Ham South seat for the Liberals. However, the party withdrew from the constituency, in favour of Keir Hardie of the Independent Labour Party, who went on to win the seat. Leicester died at the age of 77 and was buried in Nunhead Cemetery. His gravestone noted: \"From a poor working lad he became an eloquent advocate of temperance, a master craftsman in the art of glass making, and all his life took a foremost part in the social elevation of his fellow workmen, who did honour to themselves and him, by returning him as a Member of Parliament\"\"Write him down as one who loved his fellow man\""

The son of a wealthy old Dutchess County family, de Peyster joined the Union Army at the age of eighteen. He saw service in the eastern theater, and is best remembered for raising the first Union flag over the Confederate capitol of Richmond, Virginia, after its fall in 1865. After the war, de Peyster served overseas as a dignitary. When he returned to the United States, he ran for office and was elected to the State Assembly. His father disagreed with many of his political positions, and they eventually stopped speaking to each other. In 1900, the family feud culminated in a race for the office of Mayor of their native town, father running against son. After defeating his father, who owned the town hall, he was forced to move the Mayor's office to a new building. He died in 1903, survived by his three daughters."

  "text" : "James (Jim) Brochin (born February 22, 1964) is an American politician from Maryland and a member of the Democratic Party. He is currently serving in his 3rd term in the Maryland State Senate, representing Maryland's District 42 in Baltimore County. In 2010 he was reelected as a Senator for another four years, the term of a Maryland Senator. During the 2010 campaign, he raised $344,316, had $131,245 on hand and spent $225,413 on his campaign, which was more than what James Rosapepe and Andrew (Andy) Harris spent on their campaigns. On his website, he calls himself Maryland's most independent Senator. In a letter on his homepage, signed with his name at the bottom he explains the reason he still serves on the General Assembly. He writes: \"Over the last 9 years, I have always voted my conscience placing my constituents’ best interests above anything else. As I promised 9 years ago, my votes have reflected fiscal conservatism combined with a great concern for protecting open space and saving the Chesapeake Bay. I continue to remain an independent thinker, placing policy before party.\""

When the Liberal Party split over participation in the Conservative-dominated National Government, Dickie joined the breakaway National Liberals, and was elected at the 1931 general election as National Liberal MP for Consett. He was defeated at the 1935 general election, and did not stand again."

First elected to state parliament at the 1989 state election as the member for Broadsound, Pearce represented the seat of Fitzroy from the 1992 state election onwards following the abolition of Broadsound. A backbencher throughout his 20 years in state politics, he was Secretary of the Parliamentary Labor Party from 1998 to 2001 and Chair of the Select Committee on Travel Safe from 2001 to 2008. During his last term of parliament, Pearce took several months leave to receive treatment for depression. He retired at the 2009 state election. After recovering from his illness, Pearce returned to politics, gaining pre-selection to contest the seat of Mirani at the 2012 Queensland State Election, although he failed to gain the seat. Pearce was once again endorsed as the Labor Party candidate for the seat of Mirani in 2014, and this time was successful. Pearce was born in the Sydney suburb of Paddington. Prior to entering politics, he was a coal miner. He was also a Broadsound Shire councillor and served as a Corporal in the Vietnam War. Pearce has three sons."

Williams was born on 18 August 1948 in Perth, where he spent the first four years of his life. He spent his next three years in Melbourne before moving to Broken Hill in 1955. He has lived there ever since. He studied economics, accounting and financial management externally through the University of New England. At the 2007 New South Wales state election, Williams won the seat of Murray-Darling. His candidacy was boosted by the redistribution prior to the election, which turned the seat from marginal Labor to marginal National. At the election, he defeated incumbent Labor MP Peter Black on a swing of nearly nine percent, turning Murray-Darling into a safe National seat at one stroke. He was handily reelected in 2011, increasing his majority to 17 percent. In July 2014 it was revealed that Williams had verbally attacked then Coalition cabinet minister Robyn Parker with a sexist slur in April 2014, at a meeting in Parliament House during his bid for pre-selection for the New South Wales Legislative Council. He was endorsed as a National Party candidate for the Legislative Council, although in the unwinnable fourth position on the ticket, and was defeated accordingly at the election. Williams is married to Helen. He has two children and two grandchildren."

On March 26, 2012, van Dongen announced he was leaving the BC Liberal Party to sit as the only BC Conservative Party MLA in the legislature. He competed in the May 2013 election running as an independent and lost to Darryl Plecas. On April 24, 2009, van Dongen announced that the BC Office of the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles, a department for which he is responsible in the Legislature, had suspended his driver's licence for a period of four months. In an interview with CBC Radio van Dongen said the suspension was a result of his being cited twice in one year for driving in excess of 41 km/h above the posted speed limit. Van Dongen featured prominently in anti-speeding advertising campaigns for the provincial government in recent years. Three days later, van Dongen resigned as Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor-General. After the 2009 provincial election, van Dongen was appointed Party Whip, and continued in his roles as Member of the Parliamentary Committee on Finance and Government Services, and Chair of the Caucus Committee on Government Restructuring. In 2010, he was appointed as the Chair of the Parliamentary Committee to Appoint a Chief Electoral Officer for BC. On March 26, 2012, van Dongen crossed the floor of the Legislative Assembly to become the first BC Conservative Party Member of the Legislative Assembly. On September 22, 2012, he then announced he was resigning from the BC Conservative Party to sit as an independent."

He was educated at the University of Regina and the University of Saskatchewan and practised medicine in Saskatoon. Chosen as the leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party in 1996 following the resignation of Lynda Haverstock, Melenchuk was elected to the Legislature in the 1999 election. With the governing New Democrats in a minority government situation, the party entered a coalition agreement and all three Liberal MLAs — Melenchuk, Ron Osika and Jack Hillson — were appointed to the provincial cabinet. Melenchuk served as Minister of Education. The coalition was controversial among party members, however, and Hillson subsequently left to sit as an independent. Melenchuk stepped down as Liberal leader in 2001, and was succeeded by David Karwacki. Karwacki ordered Melenchuk and Osika to disband the coalition — however, both refused and officially left the Liberal caucus. They sat as independent MLAs until 2003, when they both ran for re-election as NDP candidates in the 2003 election. Both were, however, defeated by members of the Saskatchewan Party. In 2005, Melenchuk was named academic health sciences liaison between the Saskatchewan government and the University of Saskatchewan."

  "text" : "Jim Sinclair (June 3, 1933 – November 9, 2012), was a Non-Status Indian leader from Punnichy, Saskatchewan, Canada. Despite his Non-Status, rather than Métis, background, for many years he was one of the pre-eminent Métis leaders in Canada. Jim served as president of the Métis Society of Saskatchewan, and the Association of Métis and Non-Status Indians of Saskatchewan (AMNSIS), forerunners of the contemporary Métis Nation - Saskatchewan. He had a difficult youth as a road allowance person, and struggled with alcohol addiction. After beating his addiction Jim worked extensively at community level organization among his people, to get them to sober up, take responsibility for their lives, and to lead others in the struggle for their rights. He learned to become an expert at using the media, at using confrontation politics to force government to deal with peoples' immediate needs and rights. He focused on issues such as housing, institutional racism, Aboriginal land rights, hunting, fishing, and trapping rights, and education. He was part of the team who helped to establish a major network of alcohol treatment centers, along with the Gabriel Dumont Institute of Métis Studies and Applied Research. In 1987, during the Canadian constitutional talks that led to the Meech Lake Accord, Sinclair took a strong stance against Premiers Grant Devine of Saskatchewan and Bill Vander Zalm of British Columbia for what he saw as their antagonism to Métis rights. From 1994 to 1996, Mr. Sinclair led the national Congress of Aboriginal Peoples. From 1996 up until his death he was President of the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples of Saskatchewan. Sinclair was awarded the Order of the Métis Nation in 2004 for a lifetime of service to the Aboriginal community.On October 25, 2012, he was honoured at the Saskatchewan Indian Nation Assembly.

He was chosen by English backers as manager for the new Bank of Otago and emigrated to New Zealand within months. There was a great depression during the mid-1860s and Bathgate had lost money to the Commercial Banking Co., and had allowed the Southland Provincial Council to overdraw well beyond the agreed limit. These events put an end to Bathgate's banking career. From June 1871 to November 1872, he served on the Executive Council of the Otago Province. He represented two Dunedin electorates in the House of Representatives, first the City of Dunedin electorate from 1871 to 1874, when he resigned to take up the offer by Premier Julius Vogel of resident magistrate in Dunedin and district judge for Otago, and the Roslyn electorate from 1881 to 1884, when he was defeated. He was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council from 15 May 1885 to 21 September 1886, when he died. He was buried at Dunedin Northern Cemetery. He was the father of Alexander Bathgate. John Denniston was his son-in-law."

He attended St Peter's School under the guidance of his teacher, Richard O'Sullivan. From St Peter's School, he knew John Sheehan. He married Eleanor Blanche Mary Lewis in Auckland on 4 November 1882. He represented the Auckland electorate of Eden from 1876 general election (held on 6 January) until 1887, when he contested the Newton electorate. The two other candidates were Edward Withy (a political novice who, after early retirement from business, had emigrated with his large family to Auckland in 1884) and Henry Thomas Garrett. Tole and Garrett were liberal politicians, whilst Withy was a conservative. The liberal vote was split, and Tole, Withy and Garrett received 606, 701 and 170 votes, respectively, with Withy thus elected. In 1893, he became Crown Prosecutor at Auckland and remained in that role until his death. He became a King's Counsel in 1907. His death on 13 December 1920 came suddenly."

He married Mary Saunders, the sister of Chief Justice of New Brunswick, John Saunders. Ellegood supported the British governor and raised a loyalist regiment but was taken prisoner in 1776. At the end of the Revolutionary War, he received a land grant on the Saint John River where he settled with his family. Ellegood purchased Benedict Arnold's property at Fredericton when Arnold left the colony. He was named a magistrate and supervised road building in the area. He died on his property in 1801. The Elligood (1794 ship) may have been named after him."

The following year, when he ran for re-election, he lost in the Democratic primary to Bayonne's Democratic leader Matthew T. Cronin. Cain lost again in 1914, ending his political career. Cain died on January 17, 1937 in his home after a long illness at age 75. His funeral was at St. Henry's Church in Bayonne. He is buried in Holy Name Cemetery in Jersey City."

Judge Chesler added \"what Mr. Ferriero had been charged with is not considered a crime\".

In January 1919, Sinn Féin MPs refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled at the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called Dáil Éireann, though MacDonagh did not attend as he was in prison. He was elected unopposed as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) for the Tipperary Mid, North and South constituency at the 1921 elections. He also served as an alderman of Rathmines Urban District Council and Dublin Corporation between 1920 and 1922. He was Director of the \"Belfast Boycott\", an attempt in 1920–21 to boycott goods from Ulster that were being imported into the south of Ireland. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted against it. He was re-elected for the same constituency at the 1922 general election, this time as an anti-Treaty Sinn Féin TD, but he did not take his seat in the Dáil.

  "text" : "John Parkin Taylor (1812 – 12 August 1875) was a 19th-century New Zealand runholder, and a politician in Otago and Southland. In his early life, Taylor lived in various countries and studied languages in Germany. He worked as a merchant and got married when he returned to England. Taylor's family emigrated to New Zealand in 1849 and he was a sheep farmer in various parts of the South Island before finally settling on a run near Riverton in Southland, where he had his homestead 'Waldeck' built. He entered the House of Representatives for the Dunedin Country electorate through a by-election in 1858 but fell out with many of his constituents over a broken election promise, as he helped the Southland Province to break away from the Otago Province. He eventually became Southland's second Superintendent and served from 1865 to 1869, and also represented an electorate on the Southland Provincial Council for a few months. In 1865, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council and with one break in membership due to non-attendance, he remained a member until his death. He served for one year as mayor of Riverton (1872–73) but did not stand again due to poor health. Taylor had a painful illness and died in 1875."

His eldest brother William was MP for Beverley, Carlisle and East Cumberland and his next eldest brother, John, was an earlier MP for Leeds. The fourth brother, Henry Cowper, was Mayor of Leeds in 1842-1843. Marshall bought the Monk Coniston estate, near Coniston, Cumbria, from the Knott family in 1835. He later created the celebrated landscape of Tarn Hows by constructing a dam to merge three existing small tarns into the present body of water, at the same time supplying water power to his sawmill in Yewdale. The estate was later bought by Beatrix Potter and eventually passed to the National Trust. James Garth Marshall wrote a pamphlet entitled Minorities and Majorities; Their Relative Rights.

He was first selected in 1914 as Labour candidate for Leith Burghs to contest the by-election when he came third. In 1918 he was selected for the Edinburgh seat of Leith, but was replaced later that year. He was then selected by the Labour Party to fight the Newcastle East constituency at the 1922 General Election. Already ill, he was unable to travel from London to campaign in the seat, but was elected in his absence, defeating the Coalition Liberal MP, Harry Barnes. Bell died a month after his election, aged 58, and thus became one of only a handful of elected British MPs never to have taken their seats. At the subsequent by-election Arthur Henderson held the seat for Labour."

In 1894 he was elected to Manchester City Council as an Independent Labour Party councillor for the Bradford ward, an area previously represented by Conservatives. At the general election of January 1910 Sutton was elected as Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester East, the constituency that included the Bradford area. He held the seat until its abolition in 1918. At the 1918 general election Sutton stood in the new seat of Manchester Clayton, losing to the Conservative, Edward Hopkinson. Hopkinson died in 1922, forcing a by-election, and Sutton was selected as Labour candidate. The Coalition Government was very unpopular due to high unemployment and severe cutbacks recommended by the Geddes Report, and Sutton easily won the seat. He held the seat at subsequent general elections until 1931 when a large swing to the Conservatives was reflected in Clayton. William Flanagan, Sutton's opponent in the 1922 by-election took the seat. Sutton did not contest another parliamentary election."

His friend, Anti Corn Law campaigner Richard Cobden was his son's godfather. Slagg followed his father into business, and became president of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce. In 1885 he was appointed as a director of the Suez Canal Company. He made his home at Hopefield, Pendleton. In 1880 he was elected as one of Manchester's three members of parliament. The Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 divided the Manchester constituency into six divisions, and Slagg stood as the Liberal candidate at Manchester North West, but was defeated. He returned to the Commons at a bi-election in 1887 at Burnley. In 1866 he married Katherine German of Sevenoaks, Kent. John Slagg died at his Mayfair, London home in May 1889, aged 47."

He was also an Independent Labour Party member of Bradford City Council. In 1912 he was approved as a Labour Party candidate for the next general election, although he was not allocated to any constituency. In 1911 the ASRS nominated him to contest Bradford East. However, the anticipated general election was delayed until 1918 due to the First World War. At the 1918 general election he unsuccessfully contested Bradford North. He was also defeated in 1923 at Tynemouth. He finally succeeded in being elected to the Commons at the 1924 general election, when he was returned as member of parliament for Newcastle upon Tyne West. He held the seat in 1929, but was defeated when there was a large swing against Labour in 1931. He was Lord Mayor of Bradford in 1924 - 1925."

In spite of his party label, he admired President Ronald Reagan and was willing to buck his party on several issues. Mavretic became nationally known when he led a bipartisan coalition to remove Liston B. Ramsey from the position of Speaker of the House. He then served in that position from 1989 to 1990.

  "text" : "John Hottinger is a Minnesota attorney and politician and a former member and majority leader of the Minnesota Senate. First elected in 1990, he was re-elected in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2002. A Democrat, he represented the old District 24 prior to the 2002 redistricting, and the current District 23 thereafter. The district included portions of Blue Earth, Le Sueur, Nicollet, Sibley and Waseca counties in the south central part of the state. Hottinger served as a majority whip from 1993 to 2000, and as an assistant majority leader during the 2001–02 biennium. He was chosen majority leader in 2003 after Senator Roger Moe retired to run for governor. After a difficult year, in which the DFL Party majority was seen to have been outmaneuvered by Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty, Hottinger stepped down, turning power over to Senator Dean Johnson. In January 2004, he was selected the national legislator of the month by the Center for Policy Alternatives one month after Illinois legislator Barack Obama won the honor Hottinger has been quoted as saying the two of them have since taken “divergent” paths. The CPA praised Hottinger “…for disowning budget cuts and yet giving the GOP enough votes on the budget bills so that government would not be shut down, which would have imposed further pain on vulnerable Minnesotans and state employees.” The CPA added that he had \"strengthened the progressive community for battles in 2004 and beyond.\" During his time in the Senate, Hottinger chaired the following committees: Health and Family Security, Rules, and Early Childhood Policy and Finance division of the Finance Committee. He also chaired the Legislative Committee to Review Administrative Rules and Senate Subcommittees on Insurance, Consumer Protection, Rulemaking, and Higher Education, Senate Budget, Personnel, Ethical Conduct, Permanent and Joint Rules, Intergovernmental Relations and Property Taxes. Hottinger was active in the [Council of State Governments] (CSG) and chaired the [Midwestern Legislative Conference] in 2001. He became the national chair of CSG in 2004 in leadership partnership with Governor [Frank Murkowski] of Alaska who served as CSG President. He was the first Minnesota legislator or Governor to serve as the national leader of the organization other than Governor Harold Stassen who was National President in 1941-42. Hottinger chose not to run for re-election in 2006. In 2007, he faced disciplinary action for misusing funds from a settlement that he had won for a client in his work as an attorney. In 2007, he faced disciplinary action for misusing funds from a settlement that he had won for a client in his work as an attorney.[3] He was suspended for a minimum of 18 months, petitioned to lift the suspension on June 17, 2010 and the Minnesota Supreme Court returned him to practice on January 12, 2011 finding him “prepared and morally qualified” to practice law. The Supreme Court decision  followed a hearing before the Minnesota Board of Lawyer's Professional Responsibility Board on November 18. 2010 and its unanimous decision to recommend reinstatement. There were no witnesses in opposition to the reinstatement and Hottinger’s eleven character witness included local attorneys and colleagues from the political world including DFL Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, former DFL Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, former Republican U.S. Senator David Durenberger and former Republican Party Chair Charles “Chuck” Slocum. After leaving the Senate, Hottinger worked for about four years as the chief consultant for some non-profit organizations funded by Minnesota-Washington philanthropist Ned Crosby: the Jefferson Center for New Democratic Process and Promoting Health Democracy in Minnesota and, on a limited basis, Health Democracy Oregon in Portland, Oregon. That work focused on Crosby’s Citizen Jury process for promoting citizen engagement through deliberative democracy. Hottinger was the Project Director for the Citizen Jury on Election Recounts concentrating on the process used in Minnesota in the recount of the U.S. Senate race between Al Franken and Norm Coleman in 2009. Hottinger was also a leader as the initial Vice President for Legal and Government Affairs for “The Minnesota World’s Fair”, the organization which launched the effort to bring the World’s Fair to Minnesota in 2022 or 2023. Hottinger has been active in non-profits including serving on the Executive Committee and as Chair of the Northstar (Minnesota) Chapter of the Sierra Club, a member of the Board and Executive Committee of the Northeast Midwest Institute in Washington, D.C. and as a member of the Board of the Somali Justice Center in Minneapolis. Hottinger currently lives and practices law and consulting on government, non-profits and the environment with Hottinger Consulting LLC in St. Paul, Minnesota."

He went to Jamaica after his marriage in 1843 and practised law briefly at Spanish Town until returning to England later in 1843 for his wife's health. He became successful on the Northern Circuit, and in the superior courts in London and in 1864 he was created a sergeant at law. He was frequently a judge in Manchester and Liverpool, and at the City of London Court. He became QC in 1868. Simon was elected as MP for Dewsbury in 1868 and held the seat until he retired through ill health in 1888. In parliament he was particularly concerned with reforms of the judicature, and outside parliament was active in campaigning on behalf of Russian Jews. He died in 1897 aged 78."

Prior to his election as mayor, Chase was a longtime city council member, a seat which he won in 1975, becoming the first African American city council member in Spokane's history. Chase is famed for the Chase Youth Commission, a group advocating youth issues within Spokane, including the Chase Youth Awards and the Chase Youth issues forum. The youth commission is considered as a city commission and allows 8 adults and 7 youth to join every year. Chase Middle School in Spokane is named after him.Note: Daniel K. Oliver was erroneously cited in the 1979 history of the Black presence in Spokane, funded by the NAACP, as being the city's first black councilman in 1896-1897. This error has since been corrected and reported to the Washington State Historical Society."

He began working at the age of 12 as a street scavenger in Manchester by day and as a newspaper vendor by night. He subsequently had various jobs, before establishing his own stationery business. He joined the Labour Party, and was elected to Manchester City Council in 1919. In 1923 he was elected as Labour member of parliament for Salford South, unseating the sitting Conservative MP. In the following year another election was held, with the Conservatives regaining the seat. At the following election in 1929 Toole was able to regain Salford South for Labour. He was MP for two years before a swing against Labour at the 1931 general election cost him his seat. He stood again, without success, in 1935. Toole returned to local government as an alderman for the Openshaw ward of Manchester City Council. He was Lord Mayor of the city in 1936/37. In January 1944 Toole stood as an independent anti-government candidate at a parliamentary by-election in Skipton. Although he only garnered 3,029 votes and lost his deposit, his intervention was enough to enable Hugh Lawson of the Common Wealth Party to defeat the coalition candidate by 221 votes. Toole was promptly expelled from the Labour Party for breaking the war-time electoral truce between the main political parties. By the time of his death in June 1945, Toole had moved to Blackpool, where he operated a private hotel. He continued to be a member of Manchester City Council until his death."

(August 1875 – 25 May 1945) was a British trade unionist and Labour Party politician, who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Wednesbury from 1932 until his death in 1945. Banfield was General Secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers from 1915 until he retired in 1940.He unsuccessfully contested the 1918 general election in Birmingham Aston. He was a government delegate representing the work people at Geneva from 1924 to 1925. He was unsuccessful in Fulham West at a by-election in 1930 and at the 1931 general election. In 1932, the Conservative MP for Wednesbury, Viscount Ednam succeeded to the peerage as Earl of Dudley, triggering a by-election in July 1932. Banfield was selected as Labour's candidate, hoping to regain a seat which had been held by Labour from 1918 to 1931.After a campaign focusing on the means test for unemployment benefit (in a constituency with 12,000 unemployed), Banfield won the Wednesbury 1932 by-election. He was re-elected at the 1935 general election. In December 1936, he delivered an address, 'Sunday: An M.P.'s Convictions' at the Alliance Birthday Celebrations of the Imperial Alliance for the Defence of Sunday, arguing that Sunday should be a day of rest and worship. In June 1937 he made a speech in Parliament, proposing the addition of a clause to the Factories Bill: Prohibition of night work in bakehouses. His campaigning led to him being known as \"the bakers' MP\". Banfield died aged 69, in Hammersmith, London of a heart attack shortly before the 1945 general election."

Baxter represented the Liberal Party on Liverpool City Council between the years of 1906 and 1920 and was the chairman of Everton F.C. James Clement Baxter was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England, on 1 July 1857. His father, William Baxter, was originally from Clitheroe and his mother, Ann Hughes, was from Liverpool. His father was Church of England and his mother was Roman Catholic. His father was a chemist and druggist in Great Homer Street Everton, Liverpool. His mother's father, James Hughes, was from Ireland. Baxter was a Licentiate of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, renamed Royal College of Physicians of Ireland from 1890 when, under charter of Queen Victoria, it adopted the present title. According to college records he was admitted on 13 December 1878. He had received his medical training at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary and, presumably, made the short journey to Dublin just to sit the examination (as many English doctors did). After qualifying as a doctor he set up a practice in Robson Street Liverpool. Baxter was initially a medical adviser for Everton F.C. and later he reluctantly became the club's chairman. In 1892 he advanced the club a loan of £1000 to develop Goodison Park."

Weston was born in Kingsdown, Bristol, the son of Thomas Weston and his wife Mary Tuck. His father was a wealthy iron merchant at Redcliffe. He joined the family firm and developed the business to take in iron foundries, cotton manufacture and railway wagon and carriage building. He was one of the original promoters and founders of the Bristol Waggon Works and was chairman of the Patent Nut and Bolt Co. His shipping interests thrived in the time of emigration to Australia. Weston took an interest in politics and became a city councillor for Bristol in 1868, serving on the council until 1892. He was interested in public libraries, and after Bristol adopted the Public Libraries Act in 1874 he was behind the building of its first branch library at St Philips in 1876 and put some of his own money into it. He presided over Bristol's purchase and development of the Portishead and Avonmouth docks. He was mayor of Bristol for four years from 1880 to 1884. He was a J.P. for Bristol and received a knighthood. In 1885, Weston was elected MP for Bristol South, but lost the seat in 1886. In 1890 he became MP for Bristol East – a large working class constituency. He was a liberal of advanced views and in favour of Home Rule. and it was commented that “He might be a socialist if Socialism were more respectable and not so dreadfully lowering”!. Weston died at the age of 72 and was buried Arnos Vale Cemetery."

  "text" : "John \"Jack\" Richard Anthony Oldfield (5 July 1899 – 11 December 1999), was a British landowner and politician. The son of Major H E Oldfield of the Royal Field Artillery, his father was killed in action two days before his first birthday during the Second Anglo-Boer War. With his widowed mother he moved home many times, spending much time at Doddington Place Gardens, Kent, which had been purchased by his grandfather and aunt in 1906. Educated at Eton College, Oldfield was commissioned as an officer in the Grenadier Guards in the latter stages of the First World War. In 1920 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge he converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism. He also took an interest in social matters, and began voluntary work at Toynbee Hall in the East End of London and joined the Labour Party in the early 1920s. At the 1929 general election he was elected as member of parliament for South East Essex. With the formation of the Second Labour Government he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Air, Lord Thomson. Thomson was killed when the R101 airship crashed on its maiden voyage in October 1930, and Oldfield returned to the backbenches. With the formation of a National Government in August 1931 the parliamentary Labour Party was split, with supporters of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald forming the National Labour Organisation and the remaining MPs moving to the opposition benches. Oldfield chose to join the latter group, and when a general election was held in October 1931, was defeated with most of his Labour colleagues. He attempted to regain the seat in 1935 without success. Earlier in 1931 Oldfield had been elected to the London County Council to represent Whitechapel and St George's. He remained a member of the council until 1958, later representing Stepney and was vice chairman in 1954–1955. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939 Oldfield attempted to rejoin the forces, but was initially rejected due to his age. He eventually succeeded in enlisting as an able seaman in the Royal Navy. He finished the war with the rank of sub-lieutenant. In 1953 he married Jonnet Elizabeth Richards, and the couple moved to Doddington. There he created a mushroom farm while his wife worked on the gardens of Doddington Place. In 1964 he joined the Conservative Party and was elected to Kent County Council in the following year. He remained on the council until 1981. He died at Doddington aged 100 in December 1999, 68 years after leaving Parliament."

  "text" : "John William Hugill (October 3, 1881 – January 13, 1971) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as Attorney General of the province of Alberta from 1935 until 1937. Born in England, he came to Canada and studied law before setting up a practice in Calgary. He became a prominent resident of that city, and served two years on its city council. In the early 1930s, he was one of the few prominent and respectable Calgarians to support William Aberhart's Social Credit League. He ran as a candidate for it in the 1935 provincial election and, when it won, was named Attorney General by Aberhart. Hugill's time as Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) was dominated by differences of opinion with Aberhart. Hugill did not believe that social credit could be legally implemented by a provincial government and did not support the government's attempts to do so. When asked by Lieutenant Governor John Campbell Bowen whether he considered three of the government's acts to be constitutional, he replied honestly that he did not; this prompted Aberhart to request his resignation. Thereafter Hugill was an outspoken opponent of the Aberhart government, though he did not seek re-election in the 1940 election. He retired from the practice of law in 1949, and died in 1971."

In 1808 or 1809, he was licensed to practice as a physician and began work in Weathersfield, Vermont. He arrived at Buffalo in 1811. During the War of 1812, he joined the Buffalo Light Artillery Company and tended to the wounded during the first assault on Black Rock and during the burning of the village on December 31, 1813, Trowbridge was one of the last to leave, helping to secure the safety of the women and children. On September 22, 1813, he married Margaret Wintermute of Fort Erie, Ontario. He was among the many of Buffalo 's early pioneers who suffered from the economic collapse of 1836–1837, and from the speculation of Benjamin Rathbun. In 1816, he was elected as the first Treasurer of the Village of Buffalo, then elected Supervisor of Buffalo in 1823, 1825, and 1827. He was elected mayor by the Common council and accepted the office of Mayor on March 14, 1837. During his term, several new positions with the city were created, including superintendent of schools and the office of police justice. Also during his short term, the Canadian revolutionary movement, or \"Patriot War\" resulted in so much unrest in the city that it was becoming difficult to keep order. On June 17, 1837 he took a leave of absence and resigned as mayor on December 21, 1837. The council appointed Alderman Pierre A. Barker as mayor pro tem. Trowbridge resumed his medical practice and was actively engaged in his profession for 50 years. In 1839 he was president, and from 1843 to 1853, librarian, of the Erie County Medical Society and, in 1845, served as the first president of the Buffalo Medical Association. In 1847, was elected the first President of the Buffalo General Hospital and was on the medical board of the Buffalo Hospital of the Sisters of Charity. He died September 13, 1862, and was buried from St. Paul's Cathedral to Forest Lawn Cemetery."

Several years later, he moved to Buffalo and established his commission and malting businesses there. Manning was elected mayor in a special election held on January 9, 1883, as the Democratic candidate. He continued the string of vetoes begun by Mayor Grover Cleveland; they saved the city a great financial loss. Manning retired from politics after losing his campaign for re-election. He continued to grow and expand the malting business and built several grain elevators in the 1890s, each with a large storage capacity. On May 30, 1902, the largest fire Black Rock had ever seen consumed Manning's Frontier Canada plant. He died on April 28, 1908 at Brooklyn, New York and is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery."

He resigned as Supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead, N.Y., on Sept. 23, 2013, after nearly 10 years in the position following the Cuomo appointments. Kaiman was the Town's third Democratic Supervisor, following Ben Zwirn and May W. Newburger. North Hempstead is the seventh-largest municipality among 1,500 towns, cities and villages in the U.S. The Town Board elected John B. Riordan, the Town Attorney who had served as Nassau County Surrogate until 2011, to succeed Kaiman until Dec. 31, 2013. Riordan, also a Democrat, is not a candidate for the position. Kaiman had previously announced he would not run for a sixth term and was nominated as a candidate for the Nassau District Court. He later declined the nomination just before he was named to his New York state position. Kaiman, 51, implemented a number of innovative programs for North Hempstead. One, the first suburban 311 constituent-response system, fast-tracks public complaints, speeding up service to constituents and optimizing the workforce. In addition, Kaiman initiated Project Independence, a groundbreaking program designed to assist seniors who want to \"age in place.\" Kaiman was responsible for several environmental-friendly programs such as: North Hempstead's Townwide School Recycling Program, S.T.O.P. (Stop Throwing Out Pollutants/Pharmaceutical Collection Event), Operation Clean Sweep, and North Hempstead’s Earth Day Program, including EcoFest. He also led North Hempstead to green its vehicle fleet by purchasing hybrid and electric vehicles for the town. Kaiman’s tenure resulted in North Hempstead being ranked in Money ’s 2008 listing of the “Best 100 Places to Live in America.” North Hempstead was the highest of three communities within New York state to be ranked on the list."

Other significant programs under Strong’s direction include the administration of almost 13,000 water rights permits allocating some 6 million acre-feet of stream and groundwater, hydrologic studies, licensure of water well drillers, floodplain management, dam safety, and a water quality management program that includes establishment of standards and statewide monitoring of lakes and streams. Strong represents Oklahoma on the Western States Water Council and Chairs its Water Quality Committee, and also serves as Oklahoma’s Commissioner on four Congressionally-approved interstate water Compact Commissions. Strong has served three Governors of Oklahoma in various capacities since 1996: Republican Frank Keating, Democrat Brad Henry, and Republican Mary Fallin.

  "text" : "James Annand (1843 – 6 February 1906) was a Scottish journalist, newspaper editor and Liberal Party politician. Born at Longside, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the eldest son of blacksmith Robert Annand and his wife Margaret Moir, James Annand began his working life following in his father's trade as a blacksmith in Longside. He bought a share of the Buchan Observer and became its editor for about six years. Thereafter, he edited several newspapers in North East England: from 1874 to 1877 he edited the Newcastle Daily Chronicle, from 1877 to 1885 the South Shields Gazette, and finally from 1885 to 1895 was editor of the Northern Weekly Leader. After an unsuccessful bid for a parliamentary seat in Tynemouth in 1892, he was elected at the general election in January 1906 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Aberdeenshire. He died in London sixteen days later, before he had an opportunity to take his seat, thus becoming one of the shortest-serving MPs in history. His brother, Robert Cumming Annand, was also involved in the newspaper industry. James Annand was briefly married to Mary Hannah Burt in 1899 until her death in 1900."

He was a graduate of the University of New Brunswick. LaBossiere was active in many community organizations and deeply committed to many causes.

He was active in business and in veterans' groups, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1955. As the Liberal Member for Kirribilli from 1962 to 1976, he held cabinet posts in the New South Wales Parliament, including Minister for Child Welfare and Social Welfare (later Youth and Community Services), Minister for Health, and Minister for Police and Services.

He was educated at Sharp's Institution, Perth and entered the Inland Revenue in 1866. In 1870 he gained a Board of Inland Revenue scholarship in Science and studied at the Royal School of Mines winning 1st class prize in Organic and Inorganic Chemistry. He was a chemist in the Inland Revenue Laboratory at Somerset House from 1870 to 1874 and then became an instructor in the Chemical Research Laboratory at the Royal School of Mines. In 1879 he began in business as an assayer and mining expert. At the 1885 general election, Cameron was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wick Burghs as an independent liberal, defeating the sitting Liberal MP John Pender. A committed land reformer, he had been nominated by the Wick Radical Workingmen's Association and supported by the Highland Law Reform Association and appears to have been sympathetic to the Crofters Party. He served as a Liberal Party MP and held the seat until his defeat at the 1892 general election by Pender, who was by then a Liberal Unionist."

He was born in Dalzellyie, Kirkoswald, the son of John Brydan and Ann Cooper. Bryden received a certificate in mining and metallurgy and was hired by the Vancouver Coal Mining and Land Company operating near Nanaimo on Vancouver Island. In 1866, he married Elizabeth Hamilton, the daughter of Robert Dunsmuir who was a superintendent for the mine. In 1881, he went to work for a coal mining operation owned by his father-in-law. Bryden became a justice of the peace and served as a captain in the militia. He was president of the Albion Iron Works, treasurer for the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway and vice-president for the Union Colliery of British Columbia. The 1890 Coal Mines Regulation Act, provincial legislation, prevented persons of Chinese origin from working underground in coal mines. Bryden launched a legal challenge against the use of Chinese workers underground by the Union Colliery, with the intent of having the legality of the act reviewed: this resulted in the act being struck down since it was found that it interfered with federal powers. In 1875, he was elected to the Nanaimo City Council and then to the British Columbia assembly; he resigned from the assembly in 1876. Bryden was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1900. Bryden died in Esquimault at the age of 81."

In 1908 he was one of three members of the union who were nominated as parliamentary candidates. In the event he did not in fact contest an election until 1922. By 1915 he had become president of the Shoe and Boot Operatives. By 1919 he had moved to Leicester. In that year he was appointed by the Minister of Labour to the Trade Board for the Shoe and Boot Repairing Trade as a workers' representative. In 1922 he was the travelling organiser for his union and the society's principal negotiator. In the general election of 1922 he was elected to the Commons as member of parliament for the Eccles Division of Lancashire, unseating the Conservative incumbent, Marshall Stevens. He held the seat when a further election was held in 1923. Although his total number of votes fell from 14,354 to 12,227 he was able to increase his majority over Stevens from 1,803 to 1,863 with the anti-Labour vote split by the presence of a Liberal Party candidate. A minority Labour government that was formed following the election collapsed in October 1924, necessitating a further general election. Although he managed to increase his vote, Buckle was defeated in a straight fight by the Conservative candidate Albert Bethel by over 2,000 votes. He died in the following year."

Born in Kentucky, Vineyard settled in Platteville, Wisconsin, in Wisconsin Territory, in the 1840s. During this time, he was elected to the seventh Michigan Territorial Legislative Council for the western area of Michigan Territory; he was then elected to the Wisconsin Territorial Council (the equivalent of the present Wisconsin State Senate). In February 1842, in the course of a heated debate over the appointment of a sheriff for Grant County, Vineyard clashed with Charles C. P. Arndt. After the body was adjourned, Arndt's temper remained heated, he charged Vineyard's desk, and Vineyard shot Arndt dead upon the Council floor. Vineyard had boarded with the Arndt family in Green Bay during the winter of 1835-36, and is reported to have been regarded as almost one of the family; the two men were considered fast friends (even staying at the same boarding house in Madison). He was tried and acquitted of the murder and later served in the first Wisconsin Constitutional Convention of 1846 and was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1848 for one term. In 1850, he moved to California to join the Gold Rush. He settled in Sacramento, California, where he was an Indian agent. There he was elected to the California State Assembly in 1855. In 1861, he moved to Los Angeles, California, and was elected to the California State Senate in 1863. He died in Los Angeles on August 30, 1863."

He was active in the local community and in the local branch of the Country Party for many years. In 1984, following the resignation of the member for the local state seat of Murray, Tim Fischer, to contest the federal seat of Farrer, Small was selected as the Nationals' candidate for the by-election. He was elected without difficulty, defeating his only opponent, independent candidate Ray Brooks, with a 12.96% margin. He held the seat easily until 1999, when it was combined with the solid Labor seat of Broken Hill to create the new seat of Murray-Darling, a marginal National seat. In the event, both Small and Broken Hill MP Bill Beckroge retired, and the seat was won by Labor."

He promotes FairTax on newsradio talk programs, television shows, He speaks at workshops and local conferences, and manages an Internet-based promotional campaign. He has written hundreds of letters to the editor to publications such as The Atlantic explaining his advocacy of FairTax and urging citizens to write their congressperson to support FairTax bills in the House called H.R.25 and Senate called S.1025. He is the co-director of the New Jersey branch of Americans for Fair Taxation. He is a lawyer and lives in Summit, New Jersey. Regarding his advocacy of FairTax, Bennett describes himself as nonpartisan and, along with the FairTax organization, does not support either the Democratic or Republican party but advocates FairTax to leaders of both political parties. Bennett, in a television interview, explained \"Americans for Fair Taxation is a nonprofit grassroots organization that is nonpartisan and it concentrates on one issue and its purpose is to educate the public about the FairTax act.\" He conducted a letter writing campaign to try to persuade members of Congress to reform the tax code. He conducts seminars to explain FairTax to people. He participates in booths at local New Jersey town fairs. Bennett has advocated FairTax to legislative assistants of New Jersey legislators such as Senator Frank Lautenberg."

He was a captain in the West Kent Militia and was a Deputy Lieutenant of London and a Deputy Lieutenant and J.P. for Kent. Whatman was elected at 1852 general election as one of the two Members of Parliament (MP) for the Maidstone, but at the 1857 general election he did not stand again in Maidstone, and instead won one of the two seats for the Western division of Kent. He was defeated in that constituency at the 1859 general election. After a six-year absence, Whatman was returned to the House of Commons at the 1865 election for the borough of Maidstone, and held that seat until he stood down at the 1874 general election. Whatman married Louisa Isabella Ross, daughter of Charles and Lady Mary Ross in 1850."

He had previously stood unsuccessfully in the North Lonsdale at the general elections in January 1910 and December 1910, losing narrowly both occasions. In January 1910, Bliss's campaign team asked for recount after the vote was declared, but were told that the ballot boxes had already been sealed and sent by train to London. He lodged a petition, which claimed that invalid votes for Haddock had been allowed while valid votes for Bliss had been disallowed. The petition was heard in the King's Bench Division of the High Court, before Justice Lawrence and Justice Phillimore. They allowed a recount, in which the Conservative George Haddock's majority was increased to 169 votes (2.0%), and Bliss was required to pay the costs of the hearing. The Cockermouth constituency was abolished at the 1918 general election, when Bliss was one of two sitting MPs who contested the new Lonsdale constituency. The Coalition Coupon went to his Conservative opponent Claude Lowther, who won the seat. Bliss did not stand for Parliament again."

In 1461 at Calais, then belonging to the English crown, he was taken prisoner by the Earl of Warwick whilst on a military expedition during the Wars of the Roses. He there met the future Edward IV and was persuaded to defect to the Yorkist cause and fought for Edward at the Battles of Mortimer's Cross (1461), Barnet (1471) and Tewkesbury (1471). He was subsequently invested by Edward in 1471 as a Privy Counsellor (PC) and later (1484) served as Lord High Treasurer and Commissioner of Array. He was joint commander of the Army and held the office of Master of the King's Dogs in 1471. He died on 26 September 1490 and was buried at Shere, Surrey.

In his youth, his uncle Hugh often worked with his father, Thomas. Thomas built the Buena Vista Furnace in Kentucky, with Hugh as a stockholder, and, in 1856, the Means brothers became directors of the Kentucky Iron, Coal & Manufacturing Company. That spring, they helped organize the Bank of Ashland, and John became cashier, serving as such from 1866 to 1869. In 1856 he helped his father and uncle begin the Cincinnati and Big Sandy Packet Company, starting with one boat, called the Scioto, but soon expanding all the large freighters in the iron region. The Means were responsible also for initiating the ferryboat service in Ashland, Kentucky. John Means was married to Mrs. Harriet Perkins of Marietta, Ohio on October 25, 1854. John bought the land for and laid out Ashland Cemetery, and was a trustee of the graveyard for many years. In 1860, he was elected a trustee of the Town of Ashland, serving several years in that capacity. In 1869 he was instrumental in organizing the Eastern Division of the Lexington & Big Sandy Railroad Company, and in 1870 was elected president of it. The Ashland Furnace Company was owned by the railroad, the furnace being built under John's supervision. When completed, it was the largest in the United States. John's two daughters had the honor of \"firing\" it for the first time on August 30, 1869. When the Ashland Bank dissolved in 1872, and its directors instead organized the Ashland National Bank. With Hugh Means as president, John served as vice-president. In 1874 Means was a candidate for United States Representative of Kentucky.John Means helped organize in 1864 the Ashland Coal Company and also the Hanging Rock Iron & Coal Company.

There, he transferred to the Bank of New Zealand and became manager of the branch in Christchurch. On Coster's initiative, the New Zealand Shipping Company was founded in 1873, and he was its managing executive for many years. He represented the Heathcote electorate from 1884 to 1886, when he died. He was sick during the last two years of his life. Since he returned from a business trip to London in March 1886, he was unable to work, and he died on 17 December 1886 at his residence in Opawa. He is buried at the Heathcote Cemetery."

  "text" : "James Patrick Gardner (5 March 1883 - 25 July 1937) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. Born in Belfast, he was educated by the Christian Brothers there before taking up the trade of architectural sculptor. He moved to Hammersmith in West London, where he became a member of the borough council in 1919. He was also an official in the National Furnishing Trades Association. In 1922 he was chosen by the Labour Party to contest the Conservative-held seat of Hammersmith North. He failed to be elected on that occasion, but when another election was held in the following year he was elected MP for North Hammersmith by the narrow margin of 845 votes. He was unseated after less than a year when a further election was held in October 1924. In 1926, Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, the MP for Hammersmith North, resigned. In the resulting by-election, held against the background of the General Strike, Gardner regained the seat with the substantial majority of 3,611 votes. He retained the seat at the 1929 general election. Following the election the Labour Party formed a minority government. This was subsequently replaced by a National Government in August 1931 leading to a split in the Labour Party. At the election held in October 1931 Gardner, like most Labour MPs opposing the government, was defeated. Gardner did not return to parliamentary politics after his 1931 defeat, but was a member of the Hammersmith council until his death."

  "text" : "Joseph Ward (1817 – 12 November 1892) was a 19th-century member of parliament from Marlborough, New Zealand. Ward was born in Staffordshire, England. He emigrated to Nelson in 1842 on the George Fyfe. He travelled with his wife, Martha, and her family; Henry Redwood and Francis Redwood were her brothers. He was a devout catholic. Since 1854, he had lived in Brookby, a locality some 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) south of Renwick. Ward was a surveyor by trade, and he surveyed parts of the Wairau Valley, and the town and district of Kaikoura. He became a significant runholder who at one point had 50,000 sheep. He joined provincial politics in 1853 when the provinces were set up. For the first five years, he represented the Wairau electorate in the Nelson Provincial Council. When the Marlborough Province split off from Nelson, Ward was elected onto the Marlborough Provincial Council and had continuous representation until the abolition of the provincial system in 1876. Ward's first attempt of getting elected to the general assembly was in the 1872 Wairau by-election, but he was beaten by Arthur Seymour. When Seymour resigned in 1875 prior to a trip to England, Ward won the resulting 1875 by-election and represented the electorate from 21 June to 6 December, when he was defeated for Cheviot. Ward had been ill for a few months prior to his death, and for the last few days was unconscious. He died on 12 November 1892 at his home. He was survived by his wife, six sons, and two daughters. Wards Pass, an alpine pass that lies between the valleys of the upper Acheron and Awatere Rivers, was discovered by Ward and his brother-in-law, Cyrus Goulter, in March 1847, and is named after him."

  "text" : "John Lancaster (1816 – 21 April 1884) was an English Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1868 to 1874. Lancaster was the son of John Lancaster of Prestwich, Lancashire. He was engaged in the coal and iron trades and was chairman of the Lancashire Union Railway. He was a J.P. for Lancashire and a Fellow of the Geological Society. In 1865 Lancaster stood unsuccessfully for parliament at Wigan. At the 1868 general election he was elected Member of Parliament for Wigan and held the seat until 1874. Lancaster died at the age of 67. The Graphic of Saturday, April 26, 1884 recorded \"Mr. John LANCASTER, formerly M.P., for Wigan, who rose from humble beginnings to the ownership of the great mines of Nantyglo Blaina, Monmouthshire. The captain and several of the crew of the 'Alabama', after its engagement with the 'Kearage', off Cherbourg, in 1864, were rescued by Mr. LANCASTER, who, to save them, exposed his yacht to the fire of the Federal war-steamer.\" This recalls the last great sea battle of the American Civil War between the confederate ship Alabama and the union ship Kearsarge. Lancaster married Euphemia Gibson daughter of D. Gibson of Renfrewshire in 1841."

At the 1865 general election he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Great Grimsby, defeating the sitting Conservative MP John Chapman, who was also a director of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Both candidates had canvassed vigorously during the campaign, with Fildes describing himself as a Liberal who had \"ever supported measures conducive to the elevation and improvement of the condition of the people\". At the 1868 general election, there was no Conservative candidate in Grismby. However Fildes was opposed by the Liberal George Tomline, who was described by The Times as a \"formidable opponent\". Tomline won the seat, defeating Fildes with a majority of 211 votes."

In 1768, he married Elizabeth Murray. In 1777, when, as a lawyer, he was required to take an oath of allegiance to the American state, he declared himself a loyalist and left for New York City to join the British. (He was subsequently named in the Massachusetts Banishment Act of 1778.) Upham was an officer, ending the war as a major in the King's American Dragoons. He was named a judge in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in 1784. After the death of his first wife, he married Mary Chandler, the sister of Samuel Chandler and sister-law of Amos Botsford, in 1792. Upham, a slave-owner, voted to uphold the legality of slavery in New Brunswick in 1800. He died at the age of 66 in London, England, where he had gone to lobby the British government to make the salaries of Supreme Court judges in New Brunswick comparable with those in Upper and Lower Canada. His daughter Sarah married John Murray Bliss and his daughter Frances married John Wesley Weldon."

It was a short-lived victory for him and, in a hung parliament, his seat was taken, on 29 October 1924 in the General Election by his Conservative successor, Ian Fraser (later Baron Fraser of Lonsdale). He remained in politics, however, and was re-elected to the St Pancras (North) seat once again in May 1929, holding the seat until 27 October 1931, when he fell prey to again to a hung parliament, the seat being retrieved by Ian Fraser for the Conservatives."

  "text" : "J. Albert Richardson (c. 1938 – April 2, 2002) was a trade unionist and politician who was leader of the New Brunswick New Democratic Party from 1970 until 1976 save for a one month interruption in late 1971. A woods contractor in the Miramichi, Richardson became active in the union movement and was a staff representative with the Canadian Food and Allied Workers union (CFAW) and later served as secretary-treasurer of the New Brunswick Federation of Labour from 1981 to 1986. As NDP leader, Richardson was on the right wing of the party and opposed to the militancy of radicalized university students involved with the NDP. He criticized left winger NDPers who had protested the implementation of the War Measures Act during the 1970 October Crisis and was challenged by the New Brunswick chapter of The Waffle, a left wing faction in the NDP made up of Marxist students as well as older leftist activists. Under the leadership of veteran Fredericton socialist Pat Callaghan, the Waffle narrowly had its manifesto adopted by the New Brunswick NDP at a convention in the fall of 1971. The Waffle took over the party with Callaghan displacing Richardson as leader in October 1971. However, the federal party intervened and called a special convention the next month which routed the Waffle and restored Richardson as party leader. Richardson led the NDP through the 1970 and 1974 provincial elections in which the party ran seats in most of the province's ridings for the first time since the party's inception in 1960 but failed to win any seats or take the party above 3% of the popular vote. He stepped down in 1976 and returned to the union movement. He died on April 2, 2002."

  "text" : "James Baker (January 6, 1830 – July 31, 1906) was an English-born soldier and British Columbia political figure. He represented Kootenay from 1886 to 1890, East Kootenay from 1890 to 1898 and East Kootenay South from 1898 to 1900 in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. He was born in London, the son of Samuel Baker, and was educated at the Collegiate School, Gloucester and at Cambridge University. In 1855, Baker married Sarah Louise White. He entered the Indian Navy in 1845, taking part in a survey of the Arabian coast and the suppression of the slave trade. Baker later joined the British Army and fought in the Crimea. In 1858, he left the army as a very junior subaltern, and was admitted to Magdalene College, Cambridge, being awarded a BA in 1862 and MA in 1865. It was shortly before Baker’s arrival in Cambridge that a decision was taken to form the University Rifle Volunteers and in 1860, Baker was appointed first commanding officer with the rank of Major, being promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel later that year, and Gazetted full Colonel in 1906. During this time, Baker was much involved with the suggestion of a \"military degree\", a scheme supported by the Prince Consort, but lost on his untimely death. Baker also devised a new plan for the mobilisation of the volunteer forces, having them concentrate on railway centres, and which was implemented in part. Like many army officers of the day, Baker acted as a freelance, unpaid, intelligence gather, and Baker was author of the book Turkey in Europe as well has several confidential reports to the prime minister, Lord Beaconsfield. He was employed for a time as one of the private secretaries of the Duke of Westminster. In 1885, he came with his family to British Columbia, settling first at Skookumchuck and later near the present site of Cranbrook. Baker was involved in plans to develop coal deposits in Crowsnest Pass area and later in plans to construct a railway connecting British Columbia and Alberta through the Pass. Eventually, he and his partners came to an agreement with the Canadian Pacific Railway. The choice of a route passing through Cranbrook and bypassing Fort Steele led to the development of Cranbrook as the major centre in the area. Baker served in the provincial cabinet as Provincial Secretary and Minister of Education, Immigration and Mines. In 1900, he retired to England. He died in Inglewood, Parkstone, Dorset at the age of 76. Baker supported a head tax on the entry of Chinese and Japanese person into the province. Over-shadowed by his brothers, Baker's achievements are often over-looked. His brother Samuel was a British explorer and another brother Valentine was a British soldier who served in Turkey. A third brother, John Garland Baker, was the first English tea planter in Ceylon. Over-shadowed by his brothers, Baker's achievements are often overlooked. Baker Street in Nelson and in Cranbrook were named after Colonel Baker."

He was born in Cobourg, Ontario; his parents were natives of Scotland. Kellie acquired the nickname of \"Pothole\" when he was prospecting for gold in Golden around 1884. He was convinced that there was gold to be found in two deep potholes in Canyon Creek. Kellie and his two partners eventually succeeded in diverting the creek, only to find the decaying leg of a mountain goat. In 1889, Kellie and twelve other miners upset with taxation on their mines persuaded John Robson, who was passing through by train, to stop over and listen to their complaints. The outcome was that Kellie was elected to the assembly and was able to sit on the committee drafting a new Mineral and Placer Mining Act. He later served in the cabinet as Minister of Mines. Kellie mined quartz in the Kootenay region. In 1890, he moved to Revelstoke, where he founded the Miners' Association. Kellie retired from politics in 1899 to look after his mining and lumber business interests. In 1913, he moved to Victoria."

In 1860, he was asked to assist William George Cox at Rock Creek near the border with the United States. Later that year, Cox sent Haynes to Similkameen, where he established a customs house. In 1861, he was sent to Osoyoos Lake and he became deputy collector of customs in March of the following year. In 1864, he went to the Kootenay District as a justice of the peace and assistant gold commissioner. He was named to the Legislative Council in 1864. Haynes served briefly as district court judge at French Creek in 1866. In 1870, he was sent to Wild Horse Creek as magistrate and district court judge. Despite his complaints about the insufficient salary and inconvenience of the move, he served there until 1872. He then returned to Osoyoos as justice of the peace and was also employed in the federal customs department. Haynes acquired 20,000 acres (8,094 ha) of land near Osoyoos Lake. He originally established a horse ranch but soon turned to cattle ranching, owning a herd of 4,200 cattle. Haynes was married three times: first to Julia, a native woman from Colville, Washington, then to Charlotte Moresby in 1868 and finally to Josephine Pittendrigh in 1875.

  "text" : "John Stanley (Stan) Verran (24 December 1883 – 30 August 1952) was an Australian politician. Verran was born in Moonta, the son of John Verran, later Premier of South Australia. He went to work in a mine at the age of 11, and later worked as a clerk in Port Adelaide. He was involved in the formation of the Federated Clerks' Union, and served as president of the Australian Government Workers' Association. In 1918, he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as a Labor member for Port Adelaide, at the same election as his father was defeated standing for the splinter National Party. In 1924, he was selected by the party's general plebiscite as one of fifteen Labor candidates for the metropolitan area at the forthcoming election, but was defeated by Frank Condon by one vote in a Port Adelaide electorate committee vote for which two candidates would contest Port Adelaide. He was subsequently chosen to contest the more difficult seat of Sturt and lost. In 1925, the second Port Adelaide MP, John Price, resigned from parliament when he was appointed Agent-General for South Australia. Verran was selected by general plebiscite as the Labor candidate in the resulting by-election, which he won, returning to parliament. A subsequent change in party rules saw electorate committees given the power to determine their own candidates, and in August 1926 Verran lost Labor preselection for the 1927 election to John Jonas. He retired at the election, but tensions around his preselection defeat were touted as one of the reasons behind Condon's defeat by independent Protestant Labor Party candidate Thomas Thompson at that election."

He later worked at placer mining, at railroad construction and as an employment agent. In 1906, he came to Vancouver, where he worked in a stationery store. Paton also spent some time in Prince Rupert where he worked at carpentry and surveying and helped set up the post office; he also was involved in surveying and mining in Whitehorse. From Vancouver, he moved to Eburne, where he became involved in newspaper publishing. In 1908, he purchased the Point Grey Gazette, later the Vancouver Courier. Paton also operated a store where he sold books and stationery and other assorted goods and offered printing, publishing and bookbinding services. He sold the newspaper at the beginning of World War I and enlisted in the 72nd Battalion of the Canadian Infantry, serving in Belgium and France. On his return to Canada in 1918, Paton re-purchased the Gazette. He was elected to the Point Grey municipal council in 1924 and served as reeve from 1925 to 1927. In 1925, Paton and others were charged with involvement in the kidnapping of Wong Foon Sing, accused by some of having murdered Janet Smith, but Paton was acquitted. In 1926, he married Cora May Fraser. Paton sold the Gazette later that year. In 1929, he became an alderman for the city of Vancouver. During World War II, Paton supported the movement of Japanese-Canadians into the province's interior; he also opposed giving them the right to vote. He died in office at the age of 61."

Months passed and creditors grew tired of waiting in vain for a settlement, and violence soon followed. On August 6, 1835, a mob gathered and broke the windows of the house of Reverdy Johnson one of the bank's directors. Jesse attempted to protect his colleague's home, but was unable to prevent the destruction of that and many other bank directors' homes, including - eventually - his own. Hunt, having lost control of the city, resigned five days later, on August 11, 1835."

In the 2013 spring sitting, Wilson furthered his reputation for good humour when he gained access to the government whip's notepad and sent notes to Progressive Conservative MLAs while in the Legislative Assembly, some of which advised MLAs to more enthusiastically applaud their government colleagues. Wilson was an outspoken critic of changes to the funding model for persons with developmental disabilities in the 2013-2014 provincial budget, and called on the government to reduce administrative costs. On December 17, 2014, he was one of nine Wildrose MLAs who crossed the floor to join the Progressive Conservative caucus. Wilson lost his reelection campaign in 2015 to the NDP's Graham Sucha."

He was known as Johnny De Pow by his constituents. Along with Bathhouse John Coughlin and Hinky Dink Kenna, Powers was considered one of the leaders of the \"Gray Wolves\" of Chicago politics. Powers arrived in Chicago in 1872 and began working as an apprentice to a grocer. After opening his own grocery store, he added a tavern next to it and used his exposure there to begin a political career as a ward captain. In 1888, Powers ran for alderman of Chicago's 19th ward and won, after which he closed his grocery, but continued to run his saloon, eventually going into business with fellow an alderman, William O'Brian, to open a larger saloon which included gambling. Powers introduced the practice of distributing free turkeys, ducks, and geese to voters at Christmas, but his inability to keep his ward clean of garbage or maintain the schools led Jane Addams to target him. Addams also focused on Powers' corruption, citing instances of cronyism and bribery. Powers, in turn, used Addams's attacks on him to brand her as anti-Catholic, but he also hired her to be the ward's garbage inspector, the only paying job she ever held. In 1903, Powers ran against incumbent Peter F. Galligan for the state senate. During the campaign, Galligan showed up at Powers's home and attacked him with a brickbat. Powers won the election, but the following year he returned to Chicago and was reelected to serve as the 19th ward alderman, a position he retained until 1927. By the 1910s, the ethnic makeup of his ward had begun to change. Instead of being 90 percent Irish, it was only about 50 percent Irish, with the remainder being made up of Italian and Jewish immigrants. On September 28, 1920, a bomb exploded at Powers' home at 1284 Macalister shortly after he arrived, this proved to be the opening salvo in the 1921 aldermanic election. In 1921, Anthony D'Andrea, who Powers had supported for ward committeeman in 1919, but pulled his support after the Supreme Court negated D'Andrea's initial victory, challenged Powers for his seat as alderman. The election was marked by violence, which continued after Powers won the election by 381 votes. Shortly after the election, D'Andrea was assassinated. This election was the culmination of the Aldermen's Wars. Powers died as his home at 6038 Sheridan Road, on May 19, 1930, suffering from pulmonary edema and anemia, although he had been suffering throat tumors since 1929."

  "text" : "Joseph Schubert (1889 - 7 March 1952) was a Canadian politician, who served on Montreal City Council from 1924 to 1939. Originally from Romania, Schubert was a prominent labour unionist in the city, and was the only Labour Party representative on Montreal's city council. One of his first prominent actions as a city councillor was a speech protesting police harassment of participants in the city's 1924 May Day parade. In 1931, he built a public bathhouse at the corner of Bagg and St. Lawrence, which still stands today as the Schubert Bath (official French name: Bain Schubert). He served for three months as the city's acting mayor, commencing August 29, 1927, under mayor Médéric Martin. (Despite the title \"acting mayor\", however, he was never the city's official leader; in modern terms, his role would be more accurately understood as that of a deputy mayor or a mayor pro tem.) Until the appointment of Michael Applebaum as interim mayor in 2012, he was the highest ranking Jewish official in the history of Montreal's municipal government."

He received his bachelor's degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and his law degree from University of North Carolina Law School. He practiced law. Ramsey served in the North Carolina House of Representatives, as a Democrat, and served as speaker in his final term (1973-1974). He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 but was defeated in the Democratic primary by Mickey Michaux and Tim Valentine, who advanced to a runoff. Michaux was African-American, while Valentine and Ramsey were both white. Ramsey was inducted into the Order of the Long Leaf Pine in 2012 and died the next year at age 81, in Roxboro, North Carolina."

He was educated at the Grammar School at Cullen in Banffshire. He moved to Liverpool in November 1837 to join a firm of merchants. After a year, he was promoted to the firm's head office in London. After his health deteriorated through lung disease, he moved back to Scotland in 1845. After his health did not recover, he sought advice from Sir James Clark, 1st Baronet, the Queen Victoria's physician, who recommended a change in climate and relocation to either Egypt or New Zealand. Towards the end of 1846, he left for New Zealand on the Victoria. After a short period in Wellington, he briefly returned to England for business arrangements, and then settled in Auckland, where he arrived on 17 April 1849. His brother Robert had emigrated to Auckland just before him. The brothers set themselves up as merchants and commission agents. On 3 June 1852 at St Paul's Church, Gilfillan married Gertrude Anne Eliza Davies, the eldest daughter of colonial surgeon William Davies. They were to have five sons and three daughters. Gilfillan was one of the original six appointees from Auckland to the Legislative Council. He was appointed on 6 May 1854 and served until 2 August 1861 when he resigned; then 12 July 1862 to 23 April 1866 when he again resigned. He was voted onto the Auckland Provincial Council. He represented the Suburbs of Auckland electorate in the first council, from 20 July 1853 until 25 September 1855. He then represented the Auckland West electorate in the fifth council from 2 May 1867 until 27 May 1868. He was a member of the executive council for three period (14 March 1854 – 21 January 1855; 8 April 1864 – 4 November 1864; 6 May 1867 – 6 February 1868) and during some of that time, he was Provincial Secretary. Gilfillan died on 1 February 1875 from chronic bronchitis, aged 53 years."

  "text" : "James Marshall (1843 – 9 October 1912) was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council. Marshall was born in 1843 in Scotland. In New Zealand, he first lived in Southland. The West Coast Gold Rush brought him to the West Coast, and he lived in the mining communities of Granville, Orwell Creek, and Nobbs. About 1880, he settled at nearby Totara Flat, a settlement on the Grey River, where he was a farmer. He had previously been a packer, butcher, and publican. He was a member of the Grey County Council from its inception in 1877 until his death. On 28 November 1888, he was first elected chairman of the Grey Council. He chaired the county council for the years 1889, 1900, and 1909. He was a member of the Grey Education Board for 26 years until his death, and for many years served as its chairman. He was a member of the Legislative Council from 18 April 1902 to 17 April 1909; then 17 April 1909 to 9 October 1912, when he died. He was appointed by the Liberal Government under Richard Seddon, who as a fellow West Coaster knew him well. He succeeded James Kerr, who had died on 25 August 1901. James Holmes of Hokitika, another West Coaster, received his call to the Legislative Council on the same day as Marshall. Marshall died at home in Totara Flat, and was survived by his wife Annie, one son, and one daughter. He was buried at Ahaura Cemetery in one of the largest funerals that the West Coast has ever seen, and that despite a special train that was to be scheduled from Greymouth not running. The funeral procession was one or two miles long."

  "text" : "John Ingleby (22 February 1829 - 5 August 1907) was an Australian politician. He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1875 to 1877, representing the electorate of Victoria. Ingleby was born in Staffordshire in England, and migrated to South Australia in 1849. He resided in the Mount Gambier region for nearly fifty years prior to his death, living for many years at Glenburnie before moving to Mount Gambier itself several years before his death. In business, he worked as a commission agent, auctioneer and stock broker in Mount Gambier. He was heavily involved in public life in the town, serving as a justice of the peace, as clerk of the Mount Gambier Local Court and clerk of the District Council of Mount Gambier East, as a member of the original committee of the Mount Gambier Institute, and as master of the Mount Gambier Freemason lodge. His brother, Rupert Ingleby, was a prominent Adelaide lawyer who had migrated two years before him. He was elected to the House of Assembly at the 1875 election, but resigned after only two years, stating that he preferred to focus on campaigning for the division of pastoral lands into smaller properties than carrying out the duties of a member of parliament. His brother Rupert nominated for the resulting by-election, but was very narrowly defeated by Lavington Glyde. He died in 1907, aged 78, at \"Inglehurst\", his Mount Gambier home. He had been in good health until about nine months before his death."

The family emigrated to the United States in about 1868, and settled in Lebanon, Missouri. Although, he was still very young at the time, John began his study of medicine under Dr. Hugh Falconer in Scotland. He continued his studies in America at Missouri Medical College (also called McDowell Medical College) in St. Louis from where he was graduated in 1881. He began to practice medicine in Lebanon, where he resided until 1884. He moved to St. Louis, where he continued his practice for four more years, where he was on the Missouri Pacific Hospital, the railroad hospital. He also served as surgeon for the Missouri Pacific Railroad. In 1888, Dr. Rodley left Missouri for California and located in Chico. In Chico, he practiced medicine, and served on the Chico Board of Trustees, and as its President. He owed four farms, where he raised grains, fruits and nuts. In 1899, Rodley was sentenced to 12 years in prison after being found guilty of perjury in the witnessing of a forged will offered for probate. He was granted parole in 1906."

  "text" : "John Read (also John Reed) (1633 – 1730) was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from Norwalk, Connecticut Colony in the May 1715 and October 1717 sessions. He was the son of James Read. He was an officer in Oliver Cromwell's army, and a soldier from the age of sixteen. When Charles II of England was restored to the throne, Read left for America. He settled first in Providence, Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. In Providence, he married Anne Samson Derby. He later moved to Rye, Province of New York, in 1684, where he lived for three or four years. He then established himself in the western part of Norwalk, at a house he built on the eastern side of the Five Mile River, north of the Old Post Road and nearly two miles from the Long Island Sound at a place called Reed's Farms. His name is found among the records of the town of Norwalk in 1687. John Read was admitted to the bar in 1708 in Norwalk, Connecticut. His house was used for a meeting place for some years. His wife died and he married again to the Widow Scofield from Stamford. He died in Norwalk, in the ninety-eighth year of his age, in 1730, and was interred in a tomb on his own farm."

Halse settled in St Ives around 1790, where in addition to his solicitors's practice, he became town clerk and an alterman. He made his fortune through tin mines, mostly from the Wheal Reeth mine, but also from the St. Ives Consols mine. He used the Consols mine to create a political base for himself, by building the village of Halsetown to accommodate the mine-workers. The village was within the boundaries of the parliamentary borough of St Ives, allowing Halse patronage of the borough's two seats in Parliament. At the 1820 general election, both seats were taken by Halse's supporters, but his rival the borough-monger Sir Christopher Hawkins pursued him with charges of bribery, and at the 1826 election both Hawkins and Halse were elected. He was defeated at the 1830 election by William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley, nephew of the Duke of Wellington, but regained the seat in 1831 and held it until his death. In 1835, he was blackballed by the recently created St. Ives Library and Institution."

His keynote projects have been the creation of a new downtown called City Center, where a new 1,600-seat concert hall, the Palladium, opened five years ago, the redevelopment of the oldest part of town into a new Arts & Design District and building several more city parks and trails. Brainard is frequently asked to speak around the world about city planning, redevelopment and roadway networks. Under his administration, the City of Carmel has eliminated dozens of traffic signals and dangerous intersections, replacing them with roundabouts. Carmel, with 97 roundabouts as of October 2016, has more roundabouts than city in the United States."

Following his short tenure as Chief Justice, he became a Providence legislator, and Speaker of the Rhode Island House of Deputies. In this role he was on a committee to draft instructions to Providence citizens in regards to protesting the egregious Stamp Act passed by the British parliament to tax the American colonists. During the lead up to the American Revolutionary War Cole was privy to the plan and execution of the burning of the British revenue schooner Gaspee that ran aground near Pawtuxet, Rhode Island. He was deeply complicit with Stephen Hopkins and other leading Providence citizens in withholding evidence from the British commission of inquiry that was established to find the instigators of the Gaspee Affair. After a year of collecting testimonies, the court dissolved, having failed to indict a single person. In 1775 Cole became the Advocate General of Rhode Island's Vice Admiralty Court, but died of smallpox just two years later."

Mlacak was born in 1936 in Windsor, Ontario, the son of Croat immigrants. He received a bachelor's and master's degree in engineering from Queen's University. After his education, he began working for the Northern Electric Company, which later became Nortel. He stayed with Nortel until 1995. During his career, he also served as a commissioner with the National Capital Commission and was on the planning committee for the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. In 1964, Mlacak and his wife were one of the first families to move to the new subdivision of Beaverbrook. He was interested in planning issues and was excited about the prospect of beginning a community from scratch, which spurred an interest to enter politics. He served as reeve of the then-mostly rural March Township from 1968 to 1976. The rapidly suburbanizing township would become the City of Kanata in 1978, and would later be amalgamated into Ottawa in 2001. During his retirement, Mlacak focused on a career in painting. He co-founded the Kanata Civic Art Gallery and one of his works was featured in the Croatian Embassy. He was elected as a member of the Society of Canadian Artists in 2009."

Manning was appointed to cabinet by Premier Paul Davis despite not holding a seat in the House of Assembly. Manning's appointment to cabinet came under fire due to her not being an elected member and because she was unwilling to seek a seat in the House of Assembly in three by-elections. Manning stated she intended to be the Progressive Conservative candidate in the district of Placentia—St. Mary's when that seat became available. The seat is currently represented by Felix Collins who had previously indicated he would not seek re-election. On March 12, 2015, Manning was removed from cabinet along with two other ministers. Davis cited cost savings as his reason for reducing his cabinet but also noted he was unwilling to have Manning serve in cabinet for up to a year without her holding a seat in the legislature. Davis said he had originally planned on calling a spring election but that was delayed till the fall by his government's decision to remove eight seats from he House of Assembly. It was later reported that when Manning was appointed to cabinet she and Davis were under the impression that Collins would resign his seat in the near future, creating a by-election for her to run in. However, Collins did not resign his seat and he found himself back in cabinet as Attorney General after Manning's departure due to him being the only lawyer within caucus."

  "text" : "James Alexander Smith (born May 25, 1935) is a Canadian politician. He represented the electoral district of Dartmouth East in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1984 to 2003. He was a member of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party. Smith was born in Liverpool, Nova Scotia in 1935, and grew up in Port Mouton. Smith graduated with a medical degree from Dalhousie University in 1964. He practiced family medicine in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia for almost 30 years. Smith first attempted to enter provincial politics in the 1981 election, but was defeated by Progressive Conservative incumbent Richard L. Weldon. Smith ran again in the 1984 election, defeating Weldon by 903 votes to win the Dartmouth East riding. One of only six Liberals elected, Smith spent the early years of his political career in opposition. He was re-elected in the 1988 election, winning the seat by 253 votes. Smith was re-elected in the 1993 election, defeating cabinet minister Gwen Haliburton by almost 2,500 votes. Following the election, Smith would get to sit in government for the first time, as the Liberals under John Savage won a majority government. On June 11, 1993, Smith was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Community Services. On June 27, 1996, Savage shuffled his cabinet, with Smith being named Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs. On June 6, 1997, Savage announced that Smith would take over as Minister of Health on June 9, when Bernie Boudreau resigns from cabinet to run for the Liberal leadership. Smith remained as Minister of Health when Russell MacLellan took over as premier on July 18, 1997. Smith was re-elected in the 1998 election, and retained the health portfolio, but was also named Minister of Justice. In December 1998, Smith was replaced as Minister of Justice, as MacLellan shuffled his cabinet to reduce the heavy workload of some of the cabinet. Smith was re-elelcted by 265 votes in the 1999 election, but the Liberals were defeated by John Hamm's Progressive Conservatives. Smith served in opposition for one term, announcing on May 2, 2003, that he would not seek re-election in the next election."

The ward was previously represented by Adam Vaughan, who defeated him in a 2014 by-election to the House of Commons of Canada for Trinity—Spadina. He is the son of former Toronto city councillors Gordon Cressy and Joanne Campbell. His birth in 1984 made Campbell the first woman in Toronto City Council history to give birth to a child while serving as a councillor. Cressy studied public affairs and policy management at Carleton University. Prior to his entry into electoral politics, he worked for the Stephen Lewis Foundation and the Polaris Institute, and was campaign manager for Mike Layton's successful campaign for a city council seat in the 2010 municipal election and Olivia Chow's reelection campaign in the 2011 federal election. He was also initially involved in Chow's mayoral campaign in 2014, but withdrew when he decided to run in the Trinity—Spadina by-election."

Prior to entering politics, Mitic served in the Canadian Army as a sniper. He lost both of his legs in a landmine accident while fighting in the War in Afghanistan in 2007. During his recovery, Mitic worked through some of his psychological issues with a computer program named Ellie, which tracks facial expressions and speech patterns to diagnose post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. As part of his physical rehabilitation, Mitic successfully recovered and ran in an Achilles Canada 5-km run with prosthetic legs. In 2013, he and his brother Cory competed in The Amazing Race Canada, finishing in 2nd place. Following his appearance on the Amazing Race, Mitic became a motivational speaker and an advocate for wounded veterans and people with disabilities. Mitic was elected following the departure of long-time city councillor Rainer Bloess. Mitic won with close to one third of the vote, about 1800 votes ahead of his nearest competitor, Laura Dudas. Mitic lives with his wife and two daughters in the Chapel Hill neighbourhood of Orleans. His wife, Alannah Gilmore, had been one of the medics who treated him after his injury in Afghanistan. Mitic wrote a book about his experience in Afghanistan in a memoir titled  Unflinching: The Making of a Canadian Sniper."
