An out-of-court settlement with the woman, known only as 'Annie', was reached later in June 2014 in which Hancock admitted that he \"crossed the line\" into inappropriate behaviour. Hancock's resignation was announced on 18 September 2014. He stood as an independent candidate in the 2014 Portsmouth City Council elections and lost his seat in Fratton Ward to UKIP candidate Julie Swan. The Liberal Democrats lost overall control of the council. Hancock was previously the Member of Parliament for Portsmouth South for the SDP following a by-election in 1984 until 1987."

  "text" : "J. Martin Hattersley (born November 10, 1932) is an Edmonton lawyer and a long-time activist in the Canadian social credit movement. Born in Swinton, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, England, Hattersley earned degrees in economics and law from Cambridge University before moving to Alberta in 1956 where he worked as a lawyer. His parents met at a social credit conference in Britain. From 1962 to 1964, he was director of research of the Social Credit Association of Canada, and personal secretary and speechwriter to Social Credit Party of Canada leader Robert N. Thompson, MP. Hattersley served as national president of the party in the mid-1970s and ran for the party's leadership following the death of Réal Caouette in 1976, placing third. He ran again in 1978 when he was defeated by Lorne Reznowski at the party's national leadership convention by a margin of 356 votes to 115. Hattersley had campaigned on a platform of broadening the party's base and appealing to a wider spectrum of voters but was unable to overcome Reznowski's more doctrinaire approach advocating social credit monetary theory. After the party's remaining five Members of Parliament were defeated in the 1980 general election, he became leader of the party from 1981 to 1983. He resigned after the party voted to reinstatate Jim Keegstra and two others after Hattersley suspended their memberships and tried to expel them because of their anti-Semitic activism, saying \"I simply cannot be leader of a party that has people accepted into its ranks that publicly express views of that sort.\" Hattersley later claimed that Social Credit's association with \"that sort of approach . . . prevents other people from taking it seriously.\" He was also interim leader of the Social Credit Party of Alberta from 1985 to 1988, in the wake of the party's loss of its only remaining seats in the Alberta legislature and has been president emeritus since then. As leader he led an attempt to merge several Alberta parties into the Alberta Political Alliance, which proved to be a short-lived coalition of Social Credit, the Western Canada Concept and the Heritage Party, in 1986 but neither the Alliance nor Social Credit were prepared to run candidates in the 1986 Alberta election. In August 1988, the body of Hattersley's 29-year-old daughter, Cathy Greeve, was found in the bathroom at an Edmonton Transit station. She had been robbed and strangled to death. Ronald Nienhuis, on day parole while serving time for armed robbery, was charged and convicted of the crime. Since his daughter's murder, Hattersley has been involved in an Edmonton victim's support group and has spoken in prisons on alternatives to violence. He has spoken out in favour of prisoners' right to vote, telling the Edmonton Journal that \"[b]eing allowed to vote means you are being treated as a human being and a citizen and that's good from a psychological point of view.\""

  "text" : "Marc Godbout (born June 8, 1951) is the former Canadian Member of Parliament (MP) for the Ottawa—Orléans riding. He was first elected in the 2004 Canadian federal election, representing the Liberal Party of Canada. Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Godbout has a Master's degree in education from the University of Ottawa. Before entering politics, he worked as a high school history teacher. He has been Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for elementary and secondary education in Ontario and Director General and Secretary Treasurer of the Conseil des écoles catholiques de langue française du Centre-Est de l’Ontario. He entered federal politics by running for the Liberal nomination against sitting Liberal MP Eugène Bellemare. Bellemare, who held the riding for several elections, was removed. After his defeat in the nomination, Bellemare retired from politics. Godbout succeeded in beating the Conservative candidate Walter Robinson in the general election of 2004, by a slim majority. He campaigned on bringing more federal government jobs to the east end of Ottawa. In the 2006 general election, Godbout ran on a platform of Liberal support for municipalities and infrastructure. After eighteen years of the riding being held by the Liberals, Godbout was defeated for re-election when the Conservative Party of Canada won the riding under Royal Galipeau in the federal election of January 23, 2006. Godbout, along with a number of former and present Ontario Liberal MPs endorsed party leadership candidate Gerard Kennedy. At the Liberal Party Convention in Montreal, Godbout supported Michael Ignatieff after Kennedy dropped off the ballot. At the final ballot, Ignatieff was defeated by Stéphane Dion. On April 29, 2007, Godbout was nominated to run in the 40th Canadian federal election in a re-match against Galipeau. In the 2008 Canadian federal election, Godbout lost for the second time in a row to Conservative incumbent Royal Galipeau, and this time by an increased majority. The re-election of Galipeau marks the first time a Conservative candidate has been re-elected in the Orléans riding since 1872. In July 2009, Godbout announced that he would not make another run at reclaiming the riding in the next federal election. He said the decision was a professional one, as he wanted to focus on his business, a consulting firm, operating out of the east end."

She also was opposition house leader and caucus whip. Taillieu holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Winnipeg. Before entering public life she was a Registered Laboratory Technologist, and worked in the health care field for fifteen years. Taillieu has also been a successful entrepreneur. She was the founder of the Headingley Headliner, a local newspaper covering developments in Headingley, Manitoba, where she still resides. In 1996, she received a Community Development Award for her work with this newspaper. In the 2003 election, Taillieu was elected to the provincial legislature for the rural riding of Morris, located to the immediate southwest of Winnipeg. This riding is considered safe for the Progressive Conservatives; Taillieu was elected with over 57% of the popular vote, despite the party's poor showing in other parts of the province. In 2003, she criticized the provincial government's funding of a controversial display by Aliza Amihude. In the federal election of 2004, Taillieu campaigned on behalf of Conservative Party of Canada candidate Steven Fletcher. She was re-elected in the 2007 and 2011 provincial elections. Taillieu resigned her seat on February 12, 2013, citing family and health reasons."

  "text" : "Marianne Cerilli (born 1961) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She served as a New Democratic member of the Manitoba legislature from 1990 until 2003, though she was not called to cabinet when the party formed government in 1999. Cerilli was born in Toronto, raised in Winnipeg, and was educated at the University of Manitoba (from which she holds a B.P.E. and a Bachelor of Education degree). Before entering political life, she worked as a high school athletics coach, and was a counsellor in the Winnipeg School Division. She also worked at the Unemployed Health Centre of Winnipeg, and was a consultant to Manitoba Employment and Youth Services for three years. Cerilli initially intended to run for the NDP in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Broadway in the 1990 provincial election, but lost the party nomination to Conrad Santos by one vote. She instead ran in the northeast Winnipeg riding of Radisson, where she defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Mike Thompson by almost 1500 votes (incumbent Liberal Allan Patterson finished third). The Progressive Conservatives won the general election, and Cerilli joined nineteen other New Democrats in the official opposition. At the time she was the youngest woman ever elected to the Manitoba legislature. Cerilli was re-elected in the 1995 provincial election, defeating Liberal Art Miki by 4891 votes to 2401. The Progressive Conservatives won the general election again; during her time in opposition, Cerilli served as NDP critic for Housing, Workplace Safety, Health and Youth. She was regarded as one of the more left-wing members of caucus, and was the only Manitoba MLA to support Svend Robinson, rather than Lorne Nystrom, for the leadership of the federal NDP in 1995. The NDP were victorious in the 1999 provincial election, and Cerilli personally defeated Progressive Conservative Henry McDonald by 5198 votes to 3114. She was not appointed to cabinet, but served as legislative assistant to the Minister of Family Services and Housing. In 2003, she supported Bill Blaikie's campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party. Prior to the 2003 provincial election, she decided to leave her Radisson riding to run for the nomination in Wolseley. She lost to current MLA Rob Altemeyer. She now teaches part-time at the University of Winnipeg, and is operating a community development business. On September 15, 2006, Cerilli officially registered as a candidate for Mayor of the City of Winnipeg in the 2006 municipal election, but lost to incumbent mayor Sam Katz."

Walker was first elected in the ward in 1982. He is viewed as an independent and has never sided with the left or right factions on the city council. His reluctance to choose sides has meant that he has rarely been appointed to important city committees. It was not until the 2003 term of office that he was appointed chair of the Administration Committee. A long-time advocate of campaign finance reform, Walker is also known for being one of only two Toronto City Councillors who did not accept corporate donations."

  "text" : "Mark C. Poloncarz (born November 7, 1967) is the county executive of Erie County, New York. Poloncarz, a Democrat, was elected county executive on November 8, 2011 after defeating the incumbent county executive Chris Collins a Republican by a 53 - 47 percentage point margin. Poloncarz was re-elected on November 3, 2015 with 66% of the vote when he easily defeated the Republican candidate Raymond Walter (33% of the vote) and Green Party candidate Eric Jones (1% of the vote). Poloncarz is only the 2nd Democrat to be elected to the position of county executive in the 51-year history of the position. Entering 2015 Poloncarz was heavily favored to be re-elected county executive; however it was expected he would face a Republican challenge from one of three candidates: incumbent county clerk and former New York Secretary of State Christopher Jacobs, incumbent county comptroller Stefan Mychajliw, or legislator Ed Rath, the grandson of the first Erie County Executive Edward Rath. In the end, all three individuals decided not to run and Walter was chosen by the Republicans. Unlike 2015, when Poloncarz entered the race in May 2011 he was a heavy underdog. However, by focusing on issues of providing efficient, yet cost-effective government, reducing waste, fraud and abuse of the public's tax dollars, supporting the \"People's Mandates,\" and properly funding libraries and arts and cultural institutions, Poloncarz was able to chip away a sizable Collins lead until he won in surprisingly easy fashion. Poloncarz also capitalized on his \"son of a steelworker\" blue collar background against Collins self-proclaimed businessman style. Since taking office as Erie County Executive, Poloncarz worked to change the culture of Erie County government and return it to its core mission: provide the programs and services that residents and taxpayers demand as effectively and efficiently as possible. And as such, he made it a priority to restore funding for what he calls the “People’s Mandates,” which include the rodent control program, parks improvements, road and bridge construction, libraries, summer youth programming and a renewed commitment to arts and cultural organizations. These programs were restored by Poloncarz in a fiscally responsible manner without raising taxes. As evidence of the fiscal stewardship, in 2014, Standard & Poor’s upgraded the county’s credit rating three steps to “AA-” and in 2015 Fitch Ratings upgraded the county's credit rating to \"A+.\" In early 2015, Poloncarz released “Initiatives for a Stronger Community,” his health and human services plan for Erie County. The plan included 49 separate initiatives to address issues of poverty throughout the county, including issues facing the City of Buffalo, which was identified as the 3rd poorest city in America when Poloncarz took office in 2012. Poloncarz also shepherded a pay equity policy through the Erie County Industrial Development Agency requiring all applicants for tax incentives to agree to a policy to provide salary data to the agency to prove they do in fact pay women equally. In 2015, Poloncarz also worked with the county legislature to pass a budget for 2016 that reduced the county's property tax rate from $4.99 to $4.96 per thousand of assessed value, the second year in a row the county's tax rate was reduced. 2014 was a significant year for the Poloncarz administration, including working with the legislature to pass a balanced budget with a small tax cut, opening the Erie County Health Mall, signing an executive order requiring that all contractors with Erie County comply with equal pay laws for women, restructuring the Department of Social Services to address issues with the Division of Child Protective Services, and managing the emergency response to four major weather-related events: two blizzards, flooding in West Seneca and the worst storm to hit the region in nearly 40 years: Winter Storm Knife a/k/a Snowvember Storm. In 2013, Poloncarz announced his “Initiatives for a Smart Economy,” which represents his administration’s commitment to a comprehensive, innovative approach to economic development and provides the “missing link,” tying a host of diverse initiatives into one regional development effort. Specifically, this plan includes a total of 64 initiatives across a dozen areas, representing the economic gears that, working together, will help drive our economic future. More than half of these Initiatives are complete and showing results around Erie County. In fact, since Poloncarz took office as county executive in January, 2012, more than 16,000 new private sector jobs have been created in the Buffalo-Niagara Metropolitan Area, and the county's unemployment rate has dropped from 8.9% in January, 2012 to 4.7% as of December, 2015. Additionally, Poloncarz has stated the key to his administration’s success is to create strong partnerships with other levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors, educational institutions and community groups. Examples include the creation of one of New York State’s first Land Banks, the establishment of the Erie County Medicaid Anti-Fraud Unit, as well as the successful negotiation of a new 10-year lease with the Buffalo Bills that is fair for local and state taxpayers and kept the team in Buffalo following the death of the team's owner Ralph Wilson Jr. At the time Poloncarz ran for county executive in 2011 he was the elected county comptroller in Erie County. Poloncarz was first elected comptroller in 2005 and was re-elected in 2009 in a three-person race by defeating Republican Phil Kadet and Independence Party candidate Michael Abramo by a 52 - 45 - 3 percentage point margin, respectively. Prior to being elected comptroller Poloncarz was an American business and finance lawyer residing in Buffalo, New York. Poloncarz was first elected county comptroller on a platform of restoring fiscal stability and accountability to the county by acting as the taxpayers \"watchdog.\" He is the first comptroller to be elected after a state control board was created and imposed over the county to oversee county finances. While he was the endorsed candidate of the county Democratic party, he defeated 2 challengers in the primary and then a Republican in the general election. Poloncarz has a bachelor's degree from the University at Buffalo and a law degree from the University of Toledo. Poloncarz was the 2003 - 2004 Buffalo and western New York coordinator and spokesman for the John Kerry presidential campaign. He was an at large district delegate for John Kerry at the 2004 Democratic National Convention and to Hillary Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Poloncarz was the founder and first president of the WNY Coalition for Progress, a progressive think tank in upstate New York which today is known as the Western New York Democrats for Progress."

  "text" : "Michael Copps Costello (August 2, 1875 – March 22, 1936) was a Canadian printer, a medical graduate (who never practiced his profession) and the 19th mayor of Calgary, Alberta. William Costello was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1875 to John William Costello and Elizabeth Copps. As a child, he was known as Copps Costello, the name by which he is described in the 1891 census for Calgary, having been enumerated as Michael William Costello in the 1881 census for Renfrew Village, Ontario. In adult life, he changed his middle name to his mother's maiden name, Copps, the name by which he was generally known. Copps arrived in Calgary on the historic first train to the city in 1883. His early education was in Calgary and he became an apprentice printer. After completing his apprenticeship, he began working for the Calgary Herald. He went on to study medicine at Queen's University in Kingston in 1904. He then went to London, England for a year's post-graduate education and continued with further medical studies at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. While in Ireland, he visited his father's birthplace at Trienearagh, County Kerry. He married Pearl Corrigan in Kingston in 1910. On his return to Calgary, Costello entered municipal politics. In 1913 and 1914, he was an alderman on Calgary City Council. In the latter year, he was chosen to carry the responsibilities of acting mayor, during Mayor Sinnott's absence of three months. In the election for the following year, he was elected Mayor of Calgary. He spent four years as mayor - from January 2, 1915 to January 2, 1919. He ran unsuccessfully as a Conservative MLA candidate in the Calgary electoral riding in the 1921 and 1926 Alberta general elections. Following his retirement from the mayoralty, Costello became connected with the Calgary Iron Works, where he worked in an executive capacity for many years before retiring for health reasons. Costello was a founding member of the Southern Alberta Pioneer and Old Timers' Association and served as Grand Knight on the Calgary Council of the Knights of Columbus. He died in 1936, aged 60."

  "text" : "Margaret L. Bridgman (January 10, 1940 – January 4, 2009) was a Canadian politician. Bridgman was a Member of Parliament from 1993 to 1997, representing the Canadian, federal electoral district of Surrey North in Surrey, British Columbia. Born in Kimberley, British Columbia, she was elected to Parliament for Surrey North in the 1993 election as a candidate of the Reform Party of Canada. In 2001, Bridgman unsuccessfully ran for the Reform Party of British Columbia in the riding of Surrey-Newton. Before entering politics, Brigdman was a police constable, a nurse, and a nurse administrator. As a young woman, Bridgman lived and worked in London as a police constable (traffic bobby). Subsequently, she trained in London as a psychiatric nurse, becoming a Registered Nurse (RN) and a Psychiatric Nurse (PN) before returning to Canada. Bridgman went on to earn the Director of Nursing designation from the University of Saskatchewan, rising to become a nurse administrator. In September 1993, the designated Reform Party candidate for Surrey North resigned his nomination. Bridgman was President of the Surrey North Reform Party Constituency Association, and she was selected to run as the Reform Party candidate. On October 25, 1993, Margaret Bridgman was elected the Member of Parliament for Surrey North, unseating the incumbent with a plurality of 6413 votes. Prior to Bridgman's landmark victory, Surrey North and its predecessor ridings had been held either by the New Democratic Party or the Progressive Conservative Party since 1958. Bridgman served as the Reform Party Critic on Health and Assistant Critic on Indian Affairs and Northern Development. She sat as the Reform Party member of the House of Commons Standing Committees on Health and on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, during the 35th Parliament. In her maiden speech in the House of Commons, Bridgman focused on the need for more effective and cost-conscious funding of health care in Canada. Bridgman's interventions in the House of Commons ranged from remarks on health care and Indian Affairs to young offenders, old age security, and the spending priorities of the Canadian parliament. In 1997, Bridgman was successfully challenged for the Reform Party nomination by Chuck Cadman. Bridgman opted not to run as an independent in the 1997 general election, and she did not run, again, in a federal, electoral race. Following the 1997 election, Bridgman returned to nursing in Surrey, British Columbia. After a sustained battle with lung cancer, Margaret Bridgman died at home on January 4, 2009."

  "text" : "Marguerite Alice \"Missy\" LeHand (September 13, 1898 – July 31, 1944) was private secretary to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) for 21 years. According to Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, during FDR's presidency, LeHand became \"the most celebrated private secretary in the country\". Born into a poor Irish-American family in New York, LeHand attended secretarial school, took a series of clerical jobs, and eventually began to work for the Democratic Party's New York office. There she came to the attention of FDR's wife Eleanor during his 1920 vice presidential candidacy and was hired as FDR's personal secretary. After FDR was partially paralyzed by polio, LeHand became his daily companion, to the extent of adopting his favorite hobbies, games, and drinks. She remained his secretary when he became Governor of New York in 1929 and when he became president in 1933, serving until a 1941 stroke left her unable to speak. She moved to her sister's home in Boston and died in 1944. The exact nature of LeHand's relationship with FDR is debated by historians. It is generally accepted that their relationship contained a romantic element, though scholars remain divided on whether the pair had a sexual relationship. LeHand was engaged to U.S. Ambassador William Bullitt in 1933, but never married, later asking a friend, \"How could anyone ever come up to FDR?\""

  "text" : "Michael Di Biase is a Regional Councillor in (and the former mayor of) Vaughan, Ontario, an exurb of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was first elected to the city's council in 1986. Following the death of Mayor Lorna Jackson in 2002, Di Biase was appointed acting mayor by virtue of his position as senior regional councilor (a position he had held since 1988). In the 2003 municipal election, Di Biase won his first official term as mayor. The Globe and Mail newspaper reports that Di Biase received an annual salary of $164,074, making him one of the highest-paid municipal politicians in the country. The next highest paid mayor is Hazel McCallion of Mississauga at $158,704. The mayor of the largest city in Canada, David Miller of Toronto, receives $143,635 per year. The average salary of Vaughan councilors is $102,657 which is second to that of Mississauga at $113,296, while Toronto councilors earn $85,497. In the 2006 municipal election, Di Biase faced Lorna Jackson's daughter Linda Jackson and lost by 90 votes in one of the closest races of the night. After a court-ordered recount completed on April 26, 2007, which had been initiated by Di Biase, it was confirmed that Jackson had indeed won the election. Di Biase has stated he will accept the results. In 2006, he was made a Knight Officer of the Order of Merit by the Government of Italy. In September 2009, an audit was conducted on former Mayor DiBiase's 2006 election campaign. 27 contraventions were revealed in the audit. The largest notable contravention was a $155,000 cash payment made to DiBiase's law firm to pay for legal expenses. DiBiase refused to name the anonymous donor(s), citing lawyer privilege, and was eventually cleared of wrongdoing. He was elected Local and Regional Councillor for the City of Vaughan in October 2010. His term began December 1, 2010. In July, 2011, an auditing committee voted to examine expenses relating to DiBiase's 2010 campaign. It is alleged that due to improper reporting and accounting procedures on DiBiase's part, he improperly kept $32,000 in campaign funds that should have been returned to the city. In April 2015 Vaughan city's integrity commissioner concluded that Di Biase directed \"abusive language\" and \"intimidating actions\" at city staff who resisted his efforts to get confidential information from them about the bidding process for two major construction contracts. Commissioner recommended Vaughan council vote to suspend Di Biase's salary for 90 days, the highest penalty allowed for a code of conduct infraction under the provincial Municipal Act. \"I find that the respondent applied inappropriate pressure to staff with a view to exercising influence or assisting [Maystar General Contractors] with the business of the municipality,\" city's integrity commissioner wrote."

  "text" : "Maynard Sonntag (born January 31, 1956) is a Canadian politician and a former Saskatchewan cabinet minister. He was born, raised and educated in Goodsoil, Saskatchewan. Prior to being elected, Sonntag was a manager in the Credit Union system from 1980-1991. Sonntag was first elected to the Saskatchewan legislature as the member for Meadow Lake in 1991 and was re-elected in 1995, 1999 and 2003. Sonntag was first appointed to cabinet in June 1997 and held various portfolios between then and 2007, including: Property Management and Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority, Post-Secondary Education and Skills Training, Highways and Transportation, Energy and Mines, First Nations and Métis Relations, Industry and Resources, and Crown Investments Corporation. Sonntag was initially declared elected in the 2007 election, narrowly beating former federal Member of Parliament Jeremy Harrison in Meadow Lake, but was subsequently declared defeated after a count error was noted the following day. The count of absentee ballots on November 19 confirmed Harrison's victory - by only 36 votes. This result was later confirmed by a judicial recount."

  "text" : "Myrth York (born June 7, 1946) is a Democratic politician, former Rhode Island State Senator and three-time unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Rhode Island. York was born in Maplewood, New Jersey. She is the daughter of chemical engineer, entrepreneur and philanthropist Otto H. York. She earned her Bachelor of Arts from the University of Denver in 1968 and a law degree from Boston University in 1972. York earned an LL.M. from BU in taxation in 1979. York served in the Rhode Island State Senate from 1991 to 1994, and on the Senate Corporations Committee and the Senate Health, Education and Welfare Committee. During her second term she was chairman of the HEW Committee. In the Senate she was known for being strongly liberal on social issues and defending the rights of women and minorities. York served as a fellow for the Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government during the spring of 1999. York ran unsuccessfully for governor three times. She \"ran a competitive bid in 1994 — a tough year for Democrats nationally — losing to Republican Lincoln C. Almond by 3 percentage points. But she slipped further behind in the two subsequent elections, losing to Almond by 9 points in 1998 and to Carcieri by 10 points in 2002.\" The 2002 campaign was particularly costly to York as she spent $3.8 million of her own money to finance what was to be her last bid for elected office.  A key turning point in the campaign was when York criticized Carcieri for the actions of businesses he had been associated with but refused to answer Carcieri's request that she reveal what companies her personal assets were invested in. In 2006 she endorsed Republican Senator Lincoln Chafee in his unsuccessful bid for re-election. (Chafee's Democratic opponent, Sheldon Whitehouse, had run against York in the 2002 Democratic gubernatorial primary). In the endorsement, York said that Chafee would be the first Republican she voted for since Richard Nixon. York was appointed to the Providence Zoning Board of Review and was re-appointed by incoming Mayor Angel Taveras in 2011. She currently serves as the Board's chair. York has received many awards, including the United Way's Legislator of the Year Award and the Claiborne Pell Award for outstanding service to the arts and people with disabilities."

  "text" : "Mary-Woo Sims (沈明麗) is a social justice activist. Best known as a former chief commissioner of the British Columbia Human Rights Commission, Sims was also a candidate for the New Democratic Party in the electoral district of Port Moody—Westwood—Port Coquitlam in the 2006 federal election. Born in Hong Kong, Sims first came to Canada as a student in 1970. She became a Canadian citizen in 1978. A longtime community activist in both Vancouver and Toronto, Sims was associated with a significant number of non-governmental, union, government and non-profit human rights agencies and commissions. Sims was a founding member of the Women Against Violence Against Women or WAVAW Rape Crisis Centre in Vancouver. Sims participated in the BC Federation of Labour's Women's Rights Committee in the mid-1970s and helped write some of the early anti sexual harassment and affirmative action policies. During her career with the BC Telephone Company, now Telus, she was an active member of the Telecommunications Workers' Union. Sims' labour experience included work with the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union as a union organizer. Sims moved to Winnipeg to start a job with the Canadian Human Rights Commission and eventually moved to its Toronto office where she continued her labour activism becoming the president of her local with the Union of Solicitor General Employees. Before moving on to become the manager of human rights and employment equity with the then Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto or Metro Toronto, Sims was a service representative with the Public Service Alliance of Canada's office in Toronto. While at Metro Toronto, Sims helped draft the first AIDS in the Workplace Policy covering the treatment of employees and members of the public diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. She helped to develop leading and innovative policies and educational programs in human rights, employment equity and anti-harassment. Sims sat on consultation committees that helped to frame Ontario's Employment Equity Act. Sims' work in human and equality rights was recognized through appointments to the Premier of Ontario's Anti-Racism Advisory Committee, the Ontario Human Rights Commission's Board of Inquiry, the provincial pay equity tribunal, the Ontario Employment Equity Tribunal, and the Ontario Civilian Commission on Police Services. Before her government appointments, Sims was co-chair of the Campaign for Equal Families that fought for an omnibus bill that would recognize gay and lesbian partnerships and families in Ontario legistion. Sims moved back to Vancouver in 1996 to accept an appointment as the chief human rights commissioner for British Columbia. In that role, she represented BC at the Canadian Association of Statutory Human Rights Agencies or CASHRA and was elected by CASHRA to represent it at the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance or WCAR. CASHRA also elected Sims to sit on the board of the International Association of Official Human Rights Agencies (IOHRA) as its Canadian representative. At the helm of the commission, Sims hosted IAOHRA's conference \"Human Rights for the next Millennium\" in Vancouver in 2000. An out lesbian, she won the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto’s “Honouring our Heroes” Award in 1993, as well as awards from Gay Asians of Toronto and the Chinese Canadian National Council. Sims has also won other awards recognizing her work in human rights education and in community. Sims' tenure with the BC commission was controversial as she recommended expanding the Human Rights Code to include gender identity, social condition and the re-introduction of terminology that would enable a person to allege discrimination \"unless there was reasonable cause\" to prove otherwise. Sims also defended decisions of the BC Human Rights Tribunal, in particular a ruling of the Tribunal that found that a Jehovah's Witness had been discriminated against when his employer dismissed him because he refused to put up Christmas decorations contrary to his religious beliefs. In 2001, she was controversially fired from the position by Premier Gordon Campbell a year before the end of her appointed term. Sims continued her work in social justice and in community through her work in Ardent Consulting, a firm that did human rights investiagions, mediation and education work for union, corporate and government clients in Canada. She was also a board member of Vancouver Co-op Radio, IAM Cares, the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund and Canadians for Equal Marriage. Sims was also an opinion columnist with the Tri-City News, a local newspaper covering Port Moody, Coquitlam and Port Coquitlam. Sims moved for a time to Australia to look after her father who suffered from Parkinson's related dementia. Sims now spends her time between Canada and Australia and is writing her first book."

He was brought up in County Clare, Ireland, and, finding no employment, he \"drifted to London\" in 1948, aged 15, and worked as a railwayman until he entered politics. He was elected Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Islington North in a by-election in 1969 following the death of sitting MP Gerry Reynolds. He had previously been the secretary of the Constituency Labour Party. His selection over Keith Kyle was the subject of an investigation in the early 1970s by The Sunday Times newspaper. They highlighted his background with a local building company and the local Irish community and questioned the propriety of the tactics of his supporters during his selection as candidate. Regarding Northern Ireland he was staunchly pro-Nationalist and anti-Partition. In his 14 years in parliament, O'Halloran only contributed twice to parliamentary debates. O'Halloran was among the Labour MPs who defected to the new Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981. However, in 1983, the SDP chose John Grant, the MP for Islington Central (which was being abolished in boundary changes), to be its candidate in Islington North. O'Halloran left the SDP to stand as an independent Labour candidate in the 1983 general election. The official Labour candidate Jeremy Corbyn won while O'Halloran came in fourth with 11% of the vote. Grant came third with 22% of the vote. He retired to County Wexford with his wife, and lived there until his death at age 66."

Subsequently, in 1997, she was appointed Canadian Consul General to Boston. From 2002 to 2003, Clancy was president of Burlington College in Burlington, Vermont. Her resignation after less than a year was attributed to her not having raised sufficient money for the college. The 1997 federal election competition between Clancy and McDonough is the subject of the 1999 National Film Board documentary Why Women Run."

  "text" : "Margaret Brent (c. 1601 – c. 1671), an English immigrant to the Colony of Maryland, settling in its new capitol, St. Mary's City, Maryland, she was the first woman in the English North American colonies to appear before a court of the common law. She was a significant founding settler in the early histories of the colonies of Maryland and Virginia. Lord Calvert, Governor of the Maryland Colony, appointed her as the executrix of his estate in 1647, at a time of political turmoil and risk to the future of the settlement. She helped ensure soldiers were paid and given food to keep their loyalty to the colony, thereby very likely having saved the colony from violent mutiny, although her actions were taken negatively by the absentee colonial proprietor in England, Cecil Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore, and so ultimately she paid a great price for her efforts and was forced to leave the colony. With Anne Hutchinson, Brent ranks among the most prominent female figures in early Colonial American history. Hailed as a feminist by some in modern times in advancing rights of women under the laws, her insistent advocacy of her legal prerogatives as an unmarried gentlewoman of property, while notable in its exceptional energy, was consistent on paper with English law. However, in the rough, male dominated world of the colonies, her stance for her rights and her independence was unusual in actual practice and it would have been fairly uncommon back in England in that period."

  "text" : "Margaret McKay (née McCarthy; 22 January 1907 – 1 March 1996) was a British Labour Party Member of Parliament for Clapham from 1964 to 1970. Despite later assertions that McKay was born in 1911, she was in fact born on 22 January 1907 at Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, a daughter of Joseph and Betsy Ann (Catlow) McCarthy. McKay's family moved to New Bedford, Connecticut in her youth, but then returned to England. McKay joined the Independent Labour Party's Guild of Youth, then the Young Communist League, graduating to the Communist Party of Great Britain. She left the party in 1932, joining the Labour Party. She also became general secretary of the National Union of Domestic Workers. After holding various trade union posts, McKay stood unsuccessfully for Labour in Walthamstow East at the 1959 general election. At the 1964 general election, she defeated the sitting Conservative MP Alan Glyn for Clapham, taking the seat with a majority of only 556. At the 1966 election she increased her majority to over 4,000 against the Conservative Ian Gow, but she stood down at the 1970 general election, when the seat was won by the Conservative William Shelton. While in Parliament, McKay became a supporter of Arab interests, creating a mock Palestinian refugee camp in Parliament Square and wearing Arab robes during debates. Jordan issued a postage stamp in her honour. After retiring from politics, McKay moved to Abu Dhabi."

  "text" : "Mark Francis McArdle (born 21 December 1956) is an Australian politician who is Queensland's Shadow Minister for Health and a Liberal National member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland since 2004, representing the electorate of Caloundra. McArdle was the Shadow Health Minister from 12 August 2008, until the LNP's victory at the 2012 election. He was previously the state Liberal leader and the deputy opposition leader. McArdle was installed as a compromise candidate in December 2007 after a deadlock in the caucus between supporters of former leader Bruce Flegg and challenger Tim Nicholls. He had previously served as deputy leader under Flegg from 2006 to 2007. He was made Deputy Leader of the Liberal National Party after the Queensland Liberal Party merged with the Queensland National Party. After the 2009 Queensland election, Mark McArdle vacated his position as Deputy Leader, as did Leader Lawrence Springborg. Days later, John Paul Langbroek was elected Leader with Lawrence Springborg as Deputy Leader. Following the party leadership change, McArdle remained in his position as Shadow Minister for Health. After the Liberal National Party's Queensland state election, 2012 at the 2012 State Election, McArdle was appointed as Minister for Energy and Water Supply by Premier Campbell Newman. In 2013, he revealed that he had prostate cancer, and took time off from his portfolio to battle the disease. At the 2015 state election, Mark McArdle successfully defeated Labor candidate Jason Hunt to retain his state seat, despite a swing of over 20% against him."

Known for most of his life as Murray Robson, he was born in Sydney and educated at Newington College and the University of Sydney, where he gained degrees in arts and law. After working several years as a Solicitor, Robson stood for, and was elected to, parliament on 29 August 1936 at a by-election for the seat of Vaucluse. He served many years on the backbenches, he enlisted in the Second World War and served with distinction during the war, gaining promotion to lieutenant colonel and receiving the Distinguished Service Order for his service. Returning to politics, he had missed the foundation of the Liberal Party of Australia in 1945. When long-time Leader Vernon Treatt resigned the leadership in 1954 and contests between Deputy Leader Robert Askin and Pat Morton became deadlocked he was asked to stand and was consequently elected as party leader and Leader of the Opposition. He served little more than a year before he was deposed by Pat Morton. In 1957 he retired from politics and returned to his legal career before retiring. He died of a heart attack in August 1974."

  "text" : "Lieutenant Colonel Sir Michael Frederick Bruxner KBE, DSO, JP (25 March 1882 – 28 March 1970) was an Australian politician and soldier, serving for many years as Leader of the Country Party and its predecessors. Born in Tabulum in Northern New South Wales, Bruxner was educated at The Armidale School and started studies at University of Sydney but later dropped out to take up employment as a grazier and station agent in Tenterfield. After serving in the Citizen Military Forces from 1911, Bruxner enlisted into the Australian Light Horse upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Serving with distinction in Gallipoli, Egypt and Palestine, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Returning to Australia in 1919, Bruxner sold his business and joined the Progressive Party, being elected to the Parliament of New South Wales for Northern Tablelands at the 1920 election. Bruxner came to political prominence when he led the rural \"True Blues\" faction of the Progressive Party that went against their Leader's decision to form a coalition in Sir George Fuller's short-lived government in 1921. Bruxner emerged as the leader of the reduced Progressive Party, which consisted of the members of his faction, but they nevertheless joined with Fuller's Nationalists to form government in 1922. Bruxner also became involved in the New England New State Movement. Bruxner resigned the party leadership, now for the renamed Country Party, at the end of 1925. At the 1927 election, with the abandonment of proportional representation, he won the new seat of Tenterfield unopposed. Bruxner was included in new Premier Thomas Bavin's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, which included the responsibility for transport. He served until Labor won the 1930 election. In April 1932 Bruxner was elected again as the new party Country Party Leader, which he would hold continuously until 1958. When Sir Philip Game dismissed Jack Lang and called upon the Leader of the Opposition Bertram Stevens to form a caretaker government in 1932, Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Bruxner was also sworn in as Minister for Transport and briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio. Bruxner also worked with his long-time friend and Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish the New England University College in 1938, which was later to become the University of New England. Bruxner was central in ensuring Alexander Mair became Premier after Stevens was defeated in the house in August 1939. The Coalition lost government at the 10 May 1941 election and Bruxner would never again serve in government. The rest of Bruxner's parliamentary career was to be on the opposition benches, leading the Country Party through five more elections and through the instability of the larger opposition parties that eventually united as the Liberal Party of Australia. On 6 May 1958, Bruxner formally resigned as Leader of the Country Party, having served continuously in that role since 1932. He continued to serve in his capacity as Member for Tenterfield for one more term before retiring from politics before the 1962 election. Bruxner was Knighted as a KBE in 1962 and thereafter served in various capacities on boards and continued his passion for horses before his death aged 88 on 28 March 1970."

  "text" : "Minnie Lansbury (1889 - 1 January 1922) was a leading suffragette and an alderman on the first Labour-led council in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, England. Minnie was the daughter of Jewish coal merchant Isaac Glassman and the first wife (married 1914) of Edgar Lansbury, son of George Lansbury, mayor of Poplar and later leader of the Labour Party. (After Minnie's death, Edgar married actress Moyna Macgill and became the father of Angela Lansbury.) Minnie Lansbury became a teacher, and joined the East London Federation of Suffragettes in 1915. She was also chairman of the War Pensions Committee, fighting for the rights of widows, orphans and wounded from World War I. She was elected alderman on Poplar’s first Labour council in 1919, before women received Parliamentary suffrage. In 1921, she was one of five women on Poplar Council who, along with their male colleagues, were jailed for six weeks for refusing to levy full rates in the poverty-stricken area. Due to her imprisonment, she developed pneumonia and died in 1922. She was buried in the Jewish cemetery in East Ham. There is a Minnie Lansbury Memorial Clock on Electric House in Bow Road, Tower Hamlets that was erected in the 1930s. The Memorial Clock was restored in 2008 and re-fitted on Electric House. The clock was restored through a public appeal organised by the Jewish East End Celebration Society and the Heritage of London Trust. From the appeal the Heritage of London Trust raised over £13,000, which was given to Tower Hamlets Council to complete the restoration. Angela Lansbury was among those who made a donation towards the restoration of the clock. The restored clock, now painted green and gold, was officially unveiled in the presence of relatives of Minnie Lansbury and local people on Thursday, October 16, 2008."

She was the first woman elected to the House of Commons from Manitoba. She was the daughter of Robert Arthur Rogers, a businessman, and Edith Rogers, the first woman ever elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. She married Gordon Konantz in 1922. During World War II, Margaret Konantz was an active volunteer for the Patriotic Salvage Corps, Bundles for Britain and the Women's Volunteer Services. In 1944, she was one of four women sent to Great Britain by the Canadian government to work with the Women's Voluntary Service. She was awarded the Order of the British Empire posthumously for her volunteer work in the war effort. Following the death of her husband in 1954, she volunteered for UNICEF, travelling to Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, The Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Rhodesia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and the United Arab Republic on behalf of the organization. She originally stood as the Liberal candidate for Winnipeg South in the 1962 election, but was defeated by Progressive Conservative incumbent Gordon Chown. When the minority government of John Diefenbaker fell the following year, however, Konantz defeated Chown in the 1963 election. In 1964 she was the only woman on a committee of 15 MPs selected by Prime Minister Lester Pearson to choose a new flag for Canada. She served as an MP until the 1965 election, when she was defeated by new Progressive Conservative candidate Bud Sherman. Also in 1963, she was a delegate to the United Nations Third Committee on Social, Economic and Humanitarian Problems. In this capacity, she toured a number of Indian reserves in Canada to study economic and health conditions. Following her electoral defeat in 1965, she became national chair for UNICEF Canada. She undertook several further international tours until her death in 1967."

Mulla Effendi was born into a respected and intellectual family of Islamic scholars who settled in Arbil in the 16th century and spent most of their life learning and teaching Islamic studies at the Great Mosque at the Citadel of Arbil. His family was well known for their piety and learning and influential throughout Kurdistan for hundred years before him. After being educated at the Great Mosque, Mulla Effendi like his ancestors spent most of his time teaching and learning there. During his life he granted more than hundred scientific licenses for scholars from different parts of Iraq, Iran, and the Middle East in general, and sponsored the daily living and study costs of his students. He also contributed to establishing many schools and mosques in Arbil and in many different villages. He became one of the most influential figures in Kurdistan in the late 19th century and until his death. He had an important role in disengaging tribal conflicts during the Ottoman rule where he received the highest recognition by the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II.Throughout the British Mandate and after the creation of Iraq, he played a prominent role in inspiring and directing public opinion, as well as being deeply involved in the political process of the region. In 1924, he strongly urged appending Mosul Wilayah to Iraq in his meeting with the members of the League of Nations commission. He also advocated for the rights of the Christian inhabitants of Ankawa. In the events of 1941, the Iraqi royal family chose his house as the most suitable and safe for their stay, and when King Faisal II returned, he awarded him \"Wisam al-Rafidain\" of the first order as a reward for his services for his country. He also received many honors and tributes both during and after his life."

He was involved with the United Mine Workers of America and was president of Local Union 4521 from 1938 until 1941 when he had to quit mining after being seriously injured in a stone fall. He then worked as a salesman for a bakery in Sydney, Nova Scotia, forming a union and becoming its president. MacDonald was also involved in the co-operative movement helping to found the Reserves Mines Credit Union and serving as its vice-president. He served as a member of the Reserve Mines Volunteer Fire Department for over 60 years having helped found it in 1934. In the 1945 provincial election, he was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly representing the Nova Scotia Co-operative Commonwealth Federation for Cape Breton Centre. He and CCF leader Russell Cunningham were the only two Opposition members in the legislature until the 1949 provincial election. He would remain a member of the assembly for 18 years. MacDonald served as leader of the CCF from 1953 to 1963 leading the party through the 1956 and 1960 provincial election. Despite the fact that the party received almost 9% of the vote in 1960, MacDonald was the only CCFer returned either time. He stepped down as leader in 1963 and James H. Aitchison became leader of the newly formed Nova Scotia NDP. MacDonald lost his seat in the 1963 provincial election and the NDP would not gain another seat in the House of Assembly until 1970. MacDonald also continued his union work as business agent for the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers from 1957 until his retirement in 1975 and was involved with the Cape Breton Labour Council and the Nova Scotia Federation of Labour. He also became active in municipal politics serving on the Cape Breton County Council from 1974 to 1976."

  "text" : "Maurice Lamoureux is a former politician in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. He was an alderman for several years, and served as mayor of Sudbury from 1981 to 1982. Lamoureux was an office supervisor at Falconbridge Ltd. in private life. He retired in 1992, and later worked as a real estate representative with Coldwell Banker Marsh Real Estate. He was first elected as an alderman in the municipal election of 1964. He was twice defeated for the provincial New Democratic Party nomination, and later joined the Progressive Conservative Party. He was chosen as deputy mayor by council in 1978, and became acting mayor in 1981 when Jim Gordon suspended his duties to run for the provincial legislature. Gordon was elected to the legislature in the 1981 provincial election, and members of Sudbury City Council chose Lamoureux as his replacement on March 30, 1981. His only opponent, Sterling Campbell, withdrew before voting took place. Newspaper reports indicate that council declined to hold a by-election, even though almost twenty months remained in Gordon's two-year term. Lamoureux was chosen as mayor at a time of hostile relations between Sudbury City Council and the Sudbury Regional Council. He opposed a round of layoffs at Inco in 1982, and called on local businesses to support striking workers. Lamoureux brought forward what he described as a \"severe attrition policy\" in 1982, cutting 19 jobs to save $500,000 at city hall. Several senior bureaucrats were demoted, and many chose to resign. One of the bureaucrats to lose his job was city engineer Peter Wong, who later challenged Lamoureux for the mayoral position. Wong argued that it was inconsistent for Lamoureux to target the city's high unemployment rate while simultaneously cutting municipal jobs. On election day, Wong defeated Lamoureux for the mayor's position. Lamoureux was later re-elected to city council. In 1987, he argued that the city was losing money from selling surplus land at less than the assessed value. He criticized the federal government's cuts to unemployment insurance in 1989, arguing that it would devastate Sudbury's economy. Lamoureux campaigned for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1993 federal election as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party, and finished third against Liberal incumbent Diane Marleau. In 2000, he was appointed by provincial Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Tony Clement to a transitional board to amalgamate Sudbury and its neighbouring communities into the new city of Greater Sudbury. Board members were paid $400 per day. After his appointment, Lamoureux acknowledged that he was not entirely comfortable with an appointed board imposing terms on elected officials. He supported the board's decision to merge Sudbury Hydro, Capreol Hydro and Nickel Centre Hydro into Greater Sudbury Utilities, and said the board made the right decision in not selling the utilities to Ontario Hydro One. Lamoureux resigned from the transition board in October 2000 to run for the Greater Sudbury Municipal Council in the 2000 municipal election. He defended the work of the transition board, and called for tax cuts through the amalgamation process. He was defeated, finishing fifth in a two-member ward. He later applied to council for a position on Greater Sudbury Utilities, but was not hired. He ran again in the 2003 municipal election, calling for a five-year roads program. He finished sixth in the city's fourth ward. In May 2003, Lamoureux purchased a former nursing home in Sudbury called Garson Manor. He reopened the building the following year as alternative housing for seniors."

A descendant of Captain Théophile de la Cour DesBrisay (1671–1761) whose Huguenot family fled religious persecution in France and settled in Dublin, Ireland before emigrating to Canada, Mather Byles DesBrisay was the great-great-grandson of Thomas DesBrisay, a Lieutenant-Governor of St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island). He was born in Chester, Nova Scotia and was educated in Halifax and Dartmouth. Trained in law, in 1851 Mather DesBrisay was admitted to the Bar of Nova Scotia. He eventually set up a law practice in his native Chester but in 1865 made Bridgewater his home. In 1867, DesBrisay entered provincial politics as part of the anti Confederation movement and in the Nova Scotia general election was voted to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. Reelected in 1874, the following year he was named Speaker of the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia. After 1875 DesBrisay was out of politics and in 1876 he married Ada Adams Harley. Mather DesBrisay served as a County Court judge for Lunenburg, Shelburne and Queens counties until 1897. An avid historian, in 1870 he published his book titled \"History of the County of Lunenburg.\" It marked what became a major pursuit of documentation that saw a revised edition of his book published in 1895. Following his death in 1900, the town of Bridgewater acquired his vast collection of papers and artifacts and established the DesBrisay Museum as a public community history museum. Mather and Ada DesBrisay are buried together in the Brookside Cemetery in Bridgewater."

As City Council President, she became Acting Mayor succeeding Gerald McCann after his removal from office. Roman was the first woman to hold the office of mayor in the history of Jersey City. Roman attended New Jersey City University earning a bachelor's degree in elementary education and a master's degree in urban education. She worked as a teacher and supervisor for the Jersey City Board of Education. Roman became involved in politics as a member of the Everett Terrace Block Association where she served as a representative attending City Council Meetings. At the urging of McCann, she was elected to the Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders in 1984 and served two terms. Running on McCann's ticket, Roman was elected to the city council in 1989. Roman was director of the Education-Business Alliance of the Jersey City Board of Education and president of the City Council when McCann was removed from office following his conviction on Federal fraud charges. Roman continued to fill the vacancy when the city council failed to elect another candidate after 30 days. Roman served as mayor for four months until the city council reorganized and selected a new Council President. Following the announced retirement of Congressman Frank J. Guarini, Roman organized and supported a slate of candidates in the 1992 Democratic Primary. She claimed to organize the ticket to support candidates for the Democratic County Committee farther down the ballot. Roman's candidates were opposed by a slate headed by State Senator Robert Menendez and supported by Hudson County Executive Robert C. Janiszewski. Menendez defeated Robert P. Haney by a ratio of 2-1, and Roman's candidates for Democratic County Committee only won one-third of the seats. The City Council of Jersey City reorganized on July 1, 1992 and selected Joseph Rakowski as the new president. Rakowski also became acting mayor and the third mayor in that year. Roman retained her seat on the city council and completed her term. She ran to fill the remainder of the unexpired term in the special election, but came in third out of a field of nineteen candidates."

A committed Christian, she campaigned strongly against abortion. She was expelled from Call to Australia in November 1988 after a disagreement with the Niles over industrial relations policy.She thereafter held her seat as an Independent Member until the 1991 General Election, when she was one of three sitting Members whose seats were abolished by a Government sponsored Constitutional Amendment Bill which received majority approval at a Referendum held in conjunction with the 1991 General Election . Her legal challenge to the validity of that Bill was unsuccessful in the Courts. Thereafter she did not seek re-election to the Legislative Council."

He was chairperson of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (1983–1986), president of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties (1985–1987), a member of the Criminal Law Sub-Committee of the Bar Association of Queensland and of the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council (1988–1989) and National President of the Labor Lawyers Association (1989). In 1989, Foley was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as the Labor member for Yeronga. From 1992 onward, Foley served as Attorney-General of Queensland and Minister for the Arts, among other roles, in the Wayne Goss Government. In opposition from 1996-1998, Foley was Shadow Attorney-General. When Labor won government under Peter Beattie in 1998, Foley was appointed Minister for the Arts, Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. At the 2001 election, his seat was abolished and he successfully contested Yeerongpilly. Judge Roslyn Atkinson has credited Foley, in his role as Queensland Attorney-General, with making the Bench more inclusive and representative of wider society, and specifically appointing more women to the Bench.  After the election, he became Minister for Employment, Training and Youth, keeping his responsibility for the Arts but leaving his legal portfolios. Foley retired from politics in 2004."

Following the Communist coup in 1978, Mirwais Yasini worked actively to combat the Soviet invasion, and went on to oppose the Taliban from 1993 to 2001 as a social and political activist. After the fall of the Taliban regime in 2002, Yasini began his political career as the Director of Foreign Relations and Economic Evaluation for Afghanistan's Ministry of Finance, and as a prominent member of the Emergency Loya Jirga, which met in Kabul. Since that time he has held several high-level political posts, including such titles as the First Deputy Speaker of the Constitutional Loya Jirga and Director General of the Counter Narcotics Department. In 2005, Yasini was elected to the Lower House of the Afghan Parliament, and became the leader of its largest parliamentary party. In March 2009, he announced his candidacy for Afghanistan's Presidential Elections in opposition to the sitting incumbent, President Hamid Karzai."

Wilson was the son of Mathew Wilson, a solicitor of Eshton Hall and his wife Mary Clive Wilson. His father and mother were first cousins. He was educated at Harrow School and Brasenose College, Oxford. He became a J.P. at the age of 22, and became the longest serving magistrate in Skipton's history at the time of his death aged 88. Wilson was elected in 1841 as Member of Parliament for Clitheroe but was unseated in 1842. He stood again in 1847 and regained Clitheroe, but after the 1852 election was unseated again in 1853. Notwithstanding these incidents of electoral malpractice, he was created a baronet on 28 February 1874 and later that year was elected as MP for West Riding of Yorkshire North. He held the seat until it was split up under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. In the 1885 general election, he was then elected for Skipton which he held until his defeat in 1886. He also became Deputy Lieutenant and Chairman of the Board of Guardians. He married, June Louisa Emerson Amcotts, only daughter of Sir Wharton Emerson Amcotts, Bart, of Kettlethorpe Park, Lincolnshire, on 15 June 1826. They had a son Mathew (1827–1909) who succeeded to the baronetcy. She died in 1833 and many years later Wilson married Frances Pedler. His son Mathew married Gratiana Mary Thomas, daughter of Admiral Richard Darton Thomas (1777–1857). Wilson died at Brighton aged 88."

  "text" : "Michael \"Mickey\" Cafagna (July 26, 1943 - April 11, 2009) was the third elected mayor of the city of Poway, California, serving from 1998 until his death in 2009. Cafagna was born in Detroit, Michigan, the third son of Italian immigrants. He moved to Poway (then an unincorporated part of San Diego County) circa 1975; following a successful career as a real estate developer, he was appointed to the Poway City Council in 1992, eventually winning the mayoral election in November 1998. As Mayor, Cafagna represented Poway in the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), serving for a time as its chairman. His other contributions include the construction of Poway's city hall and of the South Poway Business Park on Scripps Poway Parkway, his efforts to fund much-needed improvements to freeways and transit systems, and his leadership during the Cedar and Witch Creek fires of 2003 and 2007, respectively. He was most known for his outgoing personality and his ability to make deals for the benefit of the city. His genial manner also aided him in public situations; Deputy Mayor Don Higginson recounted an incident at the 1998 World Series between the New York Yankees and the San Diego Padres where Cafagna - just before his election as Mayor - invited Higginson and about a hundred others to travel to New York for the first two games. During Game 1, the Poway contingent sat among the Yankee fans, who booed them and threw beer on them. While others got up and left, Cafagna remained and offered to buy the Yankee fans a beer. By the end of the game, they were applauding him; when the party returned for Game 2, the Yankee fans cheered him. Even his political opponents, such as Poway's first mayor Bob Emery, acknowledged that while they had been opposed to his philosophies at first (Cafagna was a real estate developer, while Emery advocated slow-growth policy), they began to see things from his point of view, just as he saw things from theirs, and they grew to respect his character and his genial attitude. Cafagna had in fact avoided doing his development business in Poway to avoid conflicts of interest, and as Mayor opposed helter-skelter sprawl throughout the region (often with the \"How much do we have to grow before we destroy the reasons we live here\" speech, as Emery termed it). In 2005, Cafagna was diagnosed with kidney cancer and underwent an operation to remove it. However, it returned nearly four years later, having spread to his lungs. His illness prevented him from conducting day-to-day city government, and as a result Deputy Mayor Higginson became acting mayor. Cafagna was admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla on March 5 from what was previously thought to be pneumonia, but later determined to be septic shock; he died there on April 11, at the age of 65. After services at St. Michael's Catholic Church, he was buried a week later at Dearborn Memorial Park in Poway. Cafagna was survived by his wife of 43 years, Sharon Green Cafagna, as well as their two children, Kevin and Stacy, and five grandchildren."

  "text" : "Mike McLarnon is a former Canadian politician, who represented the electoral district of Whitehorse Centre in the Yukon Legislative Assembly from 2000 to 2002. McLarnon was born and raised in Whitehorse, Yukon and operated several businesses in Whitehorse until assuming political office in the Yukon Legislature. While in office, he served as the Deputy Speaker of the Yukon Legislature and the Chair of the Committee of the Whole. He also served on the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on behalf of the Yukon. He was elected as a member of the Yukon Liberal Party in the 2000 election. In that election, he beat out the incumbent MLA Todd Hardy, who was the NDP candidate, and Vicky Durrant, the Yukon Party candidate, by a wide margin. However, in 2002 he was one of three MLAs, along with Wayne Jim and Don Roberts, who resigned from the Liberal Party caucus in 2002 to protest the leadership of Pat Duncan, effectively reducing Duncan's government to a minority. He continued to sit as an independent until the time that the following election was called. Analysts claim that the Liberal party's newfound minority party status and subsequent pressure from the opposition is what eventually led to the end of the Liberal party's position in the legislature. In the resulting 2002 election, McLarnon ran as an independent candidate and was defeated by New Democratic Party leader Todd Hardy. Prior to operating his own business and eventually running for political office, McLarnon pursued his higher education at Carleton University (Ottawa) and the British Columbia Institute of Technology (Vancouver). While at Carleton University, McLarnon served in the House of Commons Page Program. McLarnon is married and continues to maintain residence in Whitehorse. He is a recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal for his work in representing the political interests of Yukoners."

  "text" : "M.G.Sankar Reddiyar, a visionary and a legendary philanthropist was an entrepreneur turned politician with the vision to serve the rural masses. He served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly thrice during his lifetime. He was elected to Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly from Nanguneri constituency in 1952, 1957 and 1962 elections as an Indian National Congress candidate. Born to Shri.Kuruvaiya Reddiar and Smt.Subbammal, he went to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to pursue his studies. The entrepreneurial spirit within him inspired Shri. M G Sankarto venture into a soft beverages business. His beverages branded as “Vimto House” won the hearts of the British Army who were serving in the island during that time. His business grew and gathered roots in the island. On his return to India, he settled down near Nanguneri and continued his acts of entrepreneurship and philanthropy. He played a key role in the construction of Manimuttar dam which was proposed by the British Government and was left untouched. Now Manimuttar dam feeds more than 30 thousand acres in Naguneri and Rathapuram taluks, without which the whole area would have been dry and unimproved. Shri.Sankar was the key influence behind the ChittaruPattinangal Water Scheme that was developed in Rathapuram taluk by the then Government. His untiring efforts made this scheme happen which came as a boon to the erstwhile rain fed areas in the taluk, helping irrigation and human consumption. He invested his time and resources in building schools for the economically deprived. He constructed a building for the school at Naguneri and donated it to the government. Today the school has grown to become a Higher Secondary School bearing his name. He also made the following contributions in the field of education: • In addition he donated 26 acres of land to the government in construction of buildings in the name of Guru Sankar Government High School. Now it has become a Higher Secondary School.                      • He has also contributed 25 acres of land and constructed buildings for basic teachers training school which is now functioning as “DIET” District Institute of Education and Training. On the social front, Shri. M G Sankar was instrumental in constructing link roads between villages. The drinking water wells were provided under rural development scheme under his leadership are still yielding. He also created vast acres of farms to encourage agriculture in the region that helped the otherwise arid region become self-reliant. Thousands of families benefitted from the employment opportunities the farms provided. Shri.Sankar virtually brought about an economical revolution in the little town of Nanguneri in Tirunelveli district and the surrounding villages though his undaunted efforts and spirit of social consciousness. Service to humanity was the sole purpose of Shri. M G Sankar’s life and this prompted him to join the Indian National Congress and he went on to become the representative of the local people. He was elected as the member of legislative assembly of the then Nanguneri Constituency thrice and worked tirelessly for the upliftment of the people and his constituency. Sankar Reddiar died on 25 December 1962 while serving his third term."

She was elected to the position on August 14, 2009, at the 40th General Council of the church after five ballots, and was installed as Moderator the next day. Tindal was raised in the rural village of Victoria Square, Ontario, and earned a MA in psychology from the University of Toronto. Before her election, Tindal was already well-known within the United Church of Canada as the co-host of a United Church television program, Spirit Connection. She was also an adult educator, author, video producer, led pilgrimages to Iona (Scotland), was involved in continuing education in Jamaica, and just prior to her election, was Executive Director of Five Oaks Centre, one of the United Church’s education centres. In her remarks to the Council following her election, Tindal spoke of entering into a covenant with the church “as we live into ministry together.” Meeting with reporters afterwards, her first wish was to support the church in its desire to live in covenant relationship with God and with each other in a caring stewardship of Creation. “I am committed to encouraging young leaders... I am deeply committed to [a] right relationship with creation, in and beyond our faith community... I will be inviting the church to imagine new ways of caring for creation ... We are called to portray the integrity of creation.\" Speaking about the United Church's current struggles with declining membership and depleted financial resources, Tindal said, \"What's most important is to discern what's faithful, set a course, trust in God's abundance, and invite people into it.\" Tindal currently lives in Toronto, Ontario with her husband. She has two children, Chris, a candidate in the 2010 Toronto municipal election, and Alex, a comedy writer and performer."

On July 27, 1998, Manikrao along with R R Patil demanded that the Justice Shrikrishna Commission report be tabled on the floor of the assembly. This forced an adjournment of the assembly. His relentless criticism of the then government in the legislature ensured that when the government lost its mandate. Manikrao was made minister of state in the home ministry of Maharashtra during 1992-1995 and again 1999-2003. As minister of state for home, he headed a committee that recommended police reforms such as time-bound promotions. He also admitted to the poor state of jails in the state. He was later given the energy portfolio during 2003-2004 and in July 2004, he was one of 22 ministers to be dropped as minister by the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra Sushilkumar Shinde."

  "text" : "Alhaji Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu also known as MD Yusufu or MD Yusuf (November 10, 1931 – April 1, 2015) was a Nigerian policeman, Inspector General of the Nigerian Police Force, public servant and politician.Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu rose to the position of Inspector General of the Nigerian Police, a post he held from 1975 to 1979 during the military rule of Generals Murtala Mohammed and Olusegun Obasanjo. He was appointed chairman of Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) in 1994.In 2003, he ran as a presidential candidate. Dikko Yusufu was chairman of Nigeria LNG in 1994 when a consortium led by Halliburton's KBR subsidiary was bidding for a contract to construct a LNG export facility in competition with the US corporation Bechtel. In a letter to Yusufu in September 1994, the oil minister Don Etiebet said that the NLNG board had \"seriously tinkered with the integrity of the pending contract award\". He considered that there had been breaches of commercial confidentiality, that may have benefited the consortium led by KBR. During a probe into alleged bribes by KBR, a London-based consultant, Mr Jeffrey Tesler said he had advanced money to Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu in the form of a repayable loan.The $70,000 loan was made during a visit by Yusufu to London in 1998 or 1999.Attempts were made to implicate US Vice-President Dick Cheney in the corruption scandal, which involved over $180m of bribes on behalf of a consortium led by Halliburton. Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu headed the Grassroots Democratic Movement in Nigeria during the period of transition to democracy launched by General Sani Abacha in 1997–1998. The organization had a left wing orientation.In 2000, he became chairman of the Arewa Consultative Forum, a Northern cultural and political association. After the April 2003 elections, both Muhammadu Buhari of the ANPP and Dikko Yusufu, who had run as presidential candidate of the Movement for Democracy and Justice (MDJ), challenged the election victory by President Obasanjo.However, in June 2003, Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu, said that defeated contestants who were not ready to go to court should accept their defeat in good faith. In November 2003, Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu said the grant of asylum by President Olusegun Obasanjo to the deposed Liberian president, Charles Taylor could not be defended on the ground of either justice or commonsense, and was therefore impeachable. MD Yusufu died on April 1, 2015 in Abuja."

From 2007 to 2009, he served as Speaker of the Assembly. Huebsch, his wife, and family live in West Salem, Wisconsin. While in the State Assembly, he and fellow Republican representative and future governor Scott Walker were involved in the \"Wisconsin witch hunt\" in 2001–02, in which they attempted to terminate the employment of state employee Jamyl Witch because of her beliefs as a Wiccan. Walker claimed that Witch's hiring as a prison chaplain raised \"both personal and political concerns\" because she \"practice[d] a religion that actually offends people of many other faiths\". Huebsch likewise said that \"Taxpayers shouldn't be forced to accept this hocus-pocus,\" proposing to delete the state appropriation which funded Witch's position, although in the past he had repeatedly advocated increasing state funding for prison chaplains. Walker and Huebsch were ultimately unsuccessful in terminating Witch's employment. Huebsch resigned from the Assembly after Walker, now Governor-elect, appointed Huebsch as Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Administration on December 30, 2010. In a special election on May 3, 2011, the District 94 Assembly seat he had held for eight terms went to Democrat Steve Doyle. In early 2015 Huebsch was moved to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. His position as Secretary of Administration is now held by Scott Neitzel. Huebsch will serve six years as is one of three commissioners."

In 1980, Panzer was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in a special election to replace fellow Republican James R. Lewis (who had been convicted of perjury). (She had almost defeated then-incumbent Lewis in the 1974 Republican primary.) She served until 1993, when she was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in another special election. Panzer eventually rose to be the majority leader of the senate. In the Republican primary election in September 2004, Panzer was herself defeated for renomination by Glenn Grothman, who alleged that she was not sufficiently conservative for the modern-day Republican Party. Grothman won with a vote of 79% to 21% for Panzer."

While the 18th district leans only slightly Democratic, having a Cook PVI D+4, Cardoza only faced serious competition in 2002, when he was first elected to the seat. This race is considered competitive in 2010 because of Mike's experience in local agriculture, his family name, and the current political climate. Berryhill comes from a Republican political family that's well known in the San Joaquin Valley. Mike’s Uncle, Clare Berryhill, served in both houses of the California State Legislature and also served as director of the California Department of Food and Agriculture under Governor George Deukmejian. His first cousins, Tom and Bill Berryhill, currently represent the 25th and 26th districts, respectively, in the California State Assembly. Mike was president of Young Farmers and Ranchers of California and elected to the Turlock Irrigation District Board. He also served several decades on the Ceres School Board, and, in 2005, Berryhill Elementary School was named in honor of Mike and other members of the Berryhill family who served on the school board."

  "text" : "Mirza Mohammad Afzal Bég was a Kashmiri politician and lieutenant of the late Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Sheikh Abdullah. He was also the president of the Plebiscite Front and was arrested as one of the accused in Kashmir Conspiracy Case. In later years, he was Sheikh Abdullah's representative in talks with the Indian government in 1974, inking the 1974 Indira-Sheikh accord. Afzal Bég hailed from Anantnag and was the son of mirza Nizamudin Beg, brother of Mirza Ghulam Qadir Beg and nephew of the landlord, Mirza Ghulam Mohammad Bég, of Anantnag. He died on 11 June 1982. He was popularly known as 'Fakhr-e-Kashmir' (pride of Kashmir) and was the architect of the legendary 'land to the landless tiller' legislation which uplifted the masses of J&K. His legal acumen and genius was admired by friends and foes. He was also known as the brain behind Sheikh Abdullah. His legal acumen was lauded by the imminent legal luminary G.S.Pathak who later became the Vice President of India, who proclaimed \"Beg Sahab, you come out of politics and be a permanent part of the legal profession, you can be a jewel of any Bar\" (after hearing his arguments in the Kashmir Conspiracy case). He was immensely popular amongst his people and was perceived as the successor to Sheikh Mohd. Abdullah. He served as the first Deputy Chief Minister of the state of J&K and was seen discharging the most important functions in the State with his sheer brilliance. Historians of JK Politics hold him solely for National Conference's landslide win in the 1977 assembly elections when he single handedly ran the NC's campaign. He is survived by three sons and three daughters. His eldest son Dr Mirza Mohammad Aijaz beg is a very renowned medico and has served state government for about forty years and retired as Deputy director health services. He is the only son who has been residing at ancestral place throughout. He was never interested in politics and has got a great rapport of being pious and honest administrator and human being .His second son Mirza Mehboob Beg took on his father's mantle and is also a widely respected and envied politician in the state. The Beg family enjoys a very good rapport with the people and are widely respected for their honesty and integrity."

  "text" : "Mary Fragedakis (born April 22, 1971) is a Canadian politician, who was elected to Toronto City Council in the 2010 city council election to succeed Case Ootes in Ward 29. Prior to her election, Fragedakis was involved for the previous nine years with Open Dialogue, a conference and seminar organizing company. She is also one of the founders of the Broadview Community Youth Group. Fragedakis graduated from the University of Toronto in 1996 with a Master of Arts in political science. According to the Toronto Sun, Fragedakis \"doesn't shy away from the title of being the NDP candidate in the ward.\" The Sun also reported that she sees eye-to-eye with Mayor Rob Ford on several of his campaign pledges including cutting the personal vehicle tax and the land transfer tax. She has since indicated via her Twitter account that this was not accurate, and she does not agree with those positions. Fragedakis was critical of the KPMG report recommending cuts to services and programs without studying the implications of the proposed cuts."

Redfern graduated from the Akitsiraq Law School before becoming the first Inuk to be offered a clerkship at the Supreme Court of Canada. She was selected by outgoing Justice Louise Arbour to clerk under her replacement, Justice Louise Charron. Redfern has been a businessperson, consultant and social advocate in Iqaluit, and was most recently the executive director of the Qikiqtani Truth Commission, looking into the legacy of historical effects of federal government policies on Eastern Arctic Inuit during the period from the 1950s through the 1980s. She ran as a candidate for the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut in the 2008 territorial election in Iqaluit Centre, but lost to incumbent MLA Hunter Tootoo. She is an outspoken critic of Nunavut's government. \"We live in a chilly banana republic,” she said of the territorial government, a short time before becoming mayor. On July 24, 2012, Redfern announced at a meeting of the Iqaluit Municipal Council that she would not run for re-election in the next election."

During his term in office, the municipal council embarked on the town's first major public works projects, awarding contracts to M.N. McCarthy and W.H. Plummer for the construction of sewage, waterworks and electrical systems. However, the projects faced numerous delays, including a strike for higher wages by workers on the waterworks project, a cost overrun which forced the council to hold a referendum for authorization to spend the additional funds, and scheduling problems which resulted in the projects' completion being delayed by almost a year after the council voided the penalty clause which was its only mechanism for ensuring that the contractors finished the project on time. As a result, in that fall's municipal election, Biggar was defeated by former mayor Stephen Fournier. Following his defeat, Biggar disappeared from Sudbury in 1896, abandoning his law practice and his family. He was rumoured to have drowned in Lake Ramsey, but Sudbury resident Gus Harwood found him living in San Francisco in 1898. He had gone briefly to Yukon to prospect in the Klondike Gold Rush, but then moved to San Francisco after failing to stake a mining claim."

Montiljo was born on May 16, 1928 in Sarajevo to a poor Sephardic Jewish family of Isak and Sara (née Papo) Montiljo. His ancestors emigrated from Spain and settled in Sarajevo 500 years ago when they fled the Spanish inquisition. In 1941, during World War II, Montiljo and his family were imprisoned at the Sarajevo camp. Montiljo later escaped to Dalmatia, where in 1943 he was again imprisoned, but this time at the Rab concentration camp. After successful escape in September 1943, he joined the Partisans. After the war, Montiljo attended and finished the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb. For more than 30 years he worked on the protocol and consular affairs for the Socialist Republic of Croatia government. He was engaged in international public law as a consultant and assistant foreign relations. From 1990 to 1992, Montiljo worked as assistant to foreign minister of Croatia. Montiljo founded the \"Croatian-Israeli society\", choir \"Lira\", and was active member of the Jewish Community in Zagreb before he founded the Jewish community \"Bet Israel\" with Ivo and Slavko Goldstein. For his cultural contribution, Montiljo was awarded with Order of Danica Hrvatska by President of Croatia Stjepan Mesić. Montiljo died in Zagreb on December 17, 2006 and was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery."

At the time of its closure the waste facility was the third largest in North America near the heart of Vaughan, the fifth largest city in the Greater Toronto Area. The waste landfill site became the centre of a 14 year battle between the citizens of Vaughan and both the Province of Ontario and the City of Toronto, which owned and operated the site. Mr. Ferri co-founded Vaughan CARES, an activist group that became prominent in the fight to close the waste facility. As a community organizer Ferri also contributed to numerous cultural organizations and helped organize large events, as well as administering community recreational facilities in Toronto, Vaughan and other surrounding communities. In his roles as a York Region Separate School Board trustee, municipal and regional councillor and deputy mayor he undertook several community campaigns and frequently acted as a spokesperson for the school board, the City of Vaughan and for York Region. In October 2014 Ferri was elected to his fifth term as a councillor for the City of Vaughan and his third term as a councillor for the Region of York, Ontario."

A facilities director at the Murphy's Community Centre in Charlottetown, he won the leadership over activist Trevor Leclerc on October 13, 2012, following the resignation of James Rodd. Under Redmond's leadership, the party — which has only ever elected one MLA, Herb Dickieson, to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island — had seen significant increases in voter support, moving into second place in public opinion polls, ahead of the Prince Edward Island Progressive Conservative Party, for the first time in its history. This voter support drastically changed after a late campaign decision by Redmond to change potential ridings was seen as a sign of desperation and weakness."

  "text" : "Michael \"Mike\" Ertel (born November 29, 1969) is the Republican Supervisor of Elections of Seminole County, Florida, serving since he was appointed by Governor Jeb Bush in 2005. Ertel was born in Jacksonville, and grew up in Seminole County, attending Lake Howell High School and then later attending the University of Maryland University College. After high school, he joined the United States Army, where he served first in the Infantry and then as a public affairs representative, and took place in Army operations during the 1992 Los Angeles riots; during Operation Able Sentry, in which the United States established a base in Macedonia to monitor sanctions against Serbia; and in Bosnia during the Bosnian War. After completing his term in the Army, Ertel returned to Seminole County, where he continued his work in public affairs. In 1999, following a vacancy on the Oviedo City Council, Ertel applied for an appointment, but was ultimately not selected, in part due to concerns about a county employee being a city council member. Afterwards, he was contracted by Visit Florida, which was closely affiliated with the Florida Commission on Tourism, to work as their post-disaster public relations director. When Seminole County Supervisor of Elections Sandy Goard resigned from her office in January 2004, Dennis Joyner was appointed as her replacement. Ertel, along with fellow veteran Charles Gambaro, Jr., challenged Joyner in the Republican primary later that year. He criticized the incumbent for increased office spending, noting, \"When you spend beyond your means, then ask the county for more money, that tells me that the current administrator doesn't know how to budget,\" and declared that he would \"hold the line on the budget in his first year in office and then cut the budget in each of the succeeding three years.\" Ultimately, however, Ertel lost to Joyner in the primary. However, in 2005, following his election to the post, Joyner announced his resignation as Supervisor of Elections in a letter to then-Governor Jeb Bush, noting, \"My physicians have advised that I [resign] immediately,\" which was effective on January 10. Ertel, along with a number of other individuals, applied for the appointment to fill Joyner's position, and he was appointed by Governor Bush to serve a two-year term until the next general election. In 2006, Ertel ran for re-election, and was opposed by Democratic activist Marian Williams, who had run two years prior. He was endorsed by the Orlando Sentinel, which praised him for the fact that he \"has run elections well and has taken creative approaches to voter registration and streamlining of office operations.\" In the end, Ertel defeated Williams by a solid margin, winning 59% of the vote. In 2008 and 2012, Ertel was re-elected without opposition. In 2012, when Governor Rick Scott purged thousands of voters that he claimed to be non-citizens from the voter rolls, Ertel spoke out, asserting, \"It's frustrating that we're put in this situation that we are the ones having to contact our neighbors and say, 'Some other person's database says you may not be a citizen and we're the ones having to ask you if you are, even though we were the ones standing in the back of the room when we registered you to vote!'\" He noted that since there were so many instances in which the purged voters were actually legally eligible voters, \"[T]he list [of purged voters] should have been vetted quite a bit more before they were given to us.\" In 2013, Ertel received the International Electoral Ergonomy Award from the International Centre for Parliamentary Studies for his work as the Seminole County Supervisor of Elections; specifically, they praised him for the fact that the Voter Trust Plan he implemented increased voter confidence, increased turnout, and was \"exemplary for election management bodies worldwide.\""

In 1852, he was the Whig Party candidate for mayor of New York City. He was born in New York City in East Broadway on October 23, 1806. He was a profitable brass founder and added to his income by real estate speculation. Morgans was the leader of the Whig Party in the Seventh Ward of New York. He was elected assistant alderman in 1849, and represented the ward as alderman from 1850 to 1851. During his term as alderman, he was president of the board of aldermen, and was Acting Mayor during the temporary absence of Ambrose Kingsland. In 1852, he was nominated by the Whigs as a candidate for mayor of New York City, but lost to Jacob Aaron Westervelt. He retired from his business in 1857. In 1859, he moved to Stamford, Connecticut, where he built a residence. He lived in Connecticut for eight years, and during that time was a member of both the Connecticut House and Connecticut Senate. Upon leaving Connecticut, he settled in Cutchogue, New York, where he had previously spent his summers. He remained in Cutchogue until the death of his wife, after which he lived with his son James at 373 Monroe Street in Brooklyn until his death."

  "text" : "Matthew Canfield (also seen as Matthew Campfield) (1604 – 1673) was a founding settler of Norwalk, Connecticut and Newark, New Jersey. He served as a deputy of the General Court of the Connecticut Colony representing Norwalk in the sessions of May 1654, May 1655, May 1656, May 1657, May 1658, May 1659, May 1660, May 1661, May and October 1662, October 1663, May and October 1664, May and October 1665, and May and October 1666. He was born in Harleston, Northamptonshire, England and baptized in Saint Andrews Church on February 27, 1604. He was the son of Gregory and Joan Camfield. He came to the New Haven Colony from England prior to 1637. He was a collector for Yale College in 1645. He served as an officer in the Cavalry Troop of Connecticut from 1650-66. In February 1652, Camfield sold his home lot in New Haven. That year, he moved to Norwalk, becoming one of the area's original settlers. He lived in Norwalk for fourteen years, becoming one of the settlement's and the colony's prominent citizens. He was a deputy of the Connecticut General Court from Norwalk in 1654. In 1662, he was a magistrate and judge for the court in Fairfield. He was one of the 19 signers of the Petition to King Charles II for the Charter of the Colony. In 1666, Matthew removed to Newark, Province of New Jersey along with Robert Treat, where he was one of the founders of that town. His home lot was located at about the present north-west corner of Washington and Market Streets. Apparent his departure from Norwalk is based upon some dissatisfaction with the union of the New Haven and Hartford colonies. Canfield Island in East Norwalk is named for him. He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founding settlers of Norwalk in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery."

Educated in Montreal at Sir George Williams University and Collège Sainte-Marie de Montréal, he was a telephone technician. In 1962, he married Claudia June Burns. After serving two years on Halifax County Council, MacKay entered provincial politics in the 1978 election, defeating Liberal incumbent George Doucet in the new Sackville riding. He was re-elected in the 1981 election. In the 1984 election, MacKay was defeated by New Democrat John Holm, finishing third behind Liberal Bill MacDonald. Controversy arose during the campaign, when MacKay admitted he used a false address to claim expenses as a member living away from the capital. In April 1985, an Auditor General's report asked MacKay to repay over $7,000 in extra expenses. The money was paid back and MacKay was not charged criminally. In February 2004, a political comeback bid ended when MacKay's candidacy for the Conservative nomination in Halifax West for the 2004 federal election was rejected by the party. MacKay attempted to return to provincial politics in the 2006 election, running for the Nova Scotia Liberal Party in Hants East, but finished third."

During his term he became embroiled in a controversy when James Edwin Robertson was declared ineligible for election to the Canadian House of Commons after winning a seat in the 1882 federal election, on the grounds that he was still a sitting member of Prince Edward Island's legislative assembly, and therefore ineligible to run in the federal election. According to Robertson, in accordance with the process for resigning from the legislature he had submitted his resignation notice to two fellow MLAs, McFadyen and Peter McLaren, but a procedural error in McFadyen and McLaren's handling of the document had left the resignation improperly registered."

He was educated at Shelton State Community College and earned his bachelor's degree from New England School of Theology in 1949. He served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1965 to 1968, representing Roxbury, Massachusetts. He has also been a member of the Boston Mayor's Committee on Violence and the Attorney General's Advisory Committee on Drug Addiction. He was pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury from 1964 to 2004. During the 1960s and 1970s Haynes played an active role in the civil rights movement. In 1965, he helped plan Martin Luther King Jr.'s entrance into Boston when he came to speak on Boston Common that spring. The major focus of King's speech on April 23 was school desegregation in Boston. The Haynes Early Education school located in Roxbury was aptly named in his honor. On 9 November 2006, Northeastern University President Joseph E. Aoun met with members of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Massachusetts at the People's Baptist Church (830 Tremont Street, Boston) to discuss possible collaborations between Northeastern and Lower Roxbury clergy. During the meeting, Reverend Michael E. Haynes suggested the University create a history of the African American community in Lower Roxbury. As a result, President Aoun appointed Joseph D. Warren, at that time Special Assistant to the Director of Government Relations and Community Affairs, to oversee the Lower Roxbury Black History Project. Warren appointed an advisory board consisting of Rev. Michael E. Haynes, formerly of Roxbury's Twelfth Baptist Church, Massachusetts State Representative Byron Rushing, Northeastern University Archivist Joan D. Krizack, and Northeastern University history professors."

  "text" : "Marius Llewellyn Fransman is a South African politician who served as the Chairman of the African National Congress in the Western Cape, until 16 September 2016. He was appointed in February 2011 and November 2010, respectively. As Leader of the ANC in the DA-led Western Cape, Fransman has come under fire on several occasions for his controversial canvassing methods, which have included distributing food parcels to potential voters and promising large sums of cash to Coloured voters before the 2014 general election. In 2016 Fransman was accused of sexual harassment. Fransman is alleged to have sexually assaulted his personal assistant while en route to the ANC’s 104th birthday celebrations in Rustenburg in January 2016. On 1 February 2016 the African National Congress Secretary General Gwede Mantashe announced that Fransman will be replaced as provincial party leader while the party and the police investigate allegations of sexual harassment against him."
