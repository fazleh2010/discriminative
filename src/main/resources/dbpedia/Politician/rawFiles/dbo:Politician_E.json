  "text" : "Elwin Norris Hermanson (born August 22, 1952) is a Canadian politician, best known for being the first full-time leader of the Saskatchewan Party. In 1993 he was elected as a Reform Member of Parliament in the Saskatchewan riding of Kindersley—Lloydminster. He was the Reform Party House Leader from 1993 until 1995. Due to redistribution his hometown was located in the new constituency of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar for the 1997 election. He ran against fellow incumbent Chris Axworthy of the New Democratic Party for the new seat and lost. Hermanson sought the leadership of the newly founded Saskatchewan Party in 1998, and defeated Rod Gantefoer and Yogi Huyghebaert in a one member one vote election. He was elected to the provincial legislature for Rosetown-Biggar in the 1999 provincial election and became Leader of the Opposition. While the party reduced the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party to a minority government, it was almost nonexistent outside the rural areas; it was completely shut out in Regina and won only one seat in Saskatoon. Ultimately, this left the Saskatchewan Party five seats short of making Hermanson Premier. Hermanson was widely expected to lead the party to victory in 2003. However, he came up short again in the provincial election that November, in which the NDP actually won a bare majority. While the Saskatchewan Party scored a net gain of two seats, both in Saskatoon, it was shut out of Regina once again. Hermanson resigned days after the election and was subsequently succeeded by Brad Wall. Hermanson remained the MLA for the new constituency of Rosetown-Elrose. On Friday, June 23, 2006, Hermanson announced that he would not be seeking re-election to the legislature."

  "text" : "Edson Jonasi Zvobgo (2 October 1935 – 22 August 2004) was a founder of Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF, was the Patriotic Front's spokesman at the Lancaster House in late 1979, a Harvard-trained lawyer, and a poet. His name is often misspelled by the media, either as Eddison instead of Edson or Zvogbo instead of Zvobgo. He was born in then Southern Rhodesia in 1935, near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo), where his father was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1960, Zvobgo won a scholarship to Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts aged 25. After taking a bachelor's degree there in 1964, he returned home to be arrested and detained for political activism against white rule in Rhodesia, along with Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo. Zvobgo was freed in 1971, and he spent a period in exile in Canada. He then studied law at Harvard and international relations at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, followed by a position as associate professor teaching criminal law at Lewis University College in Illinois. Zvobgo played a key role in international negotiations at Lancaster House that ended the bitter bush war and led to British-sponsored all race elections ahead of independence in 1980. He was the Zanu-PF spokesman, and impressed many in the international press with his quick repartee and astute analysis of the negotiations. In the 1980 elections, he won a seat in parliament for Masvingo, which he continued to hold until his death. An influential member of Zimbabwe's first fully independent cabinet, Zvobgo was minister for local government and housing until 1982, and minister for justice until 1985. As minister of parliamentary and constitutional affairs, in 1987 he made several amendments to the Constitution that concentrated power in the hands of the president and moved Zimbabwe towards a one-party state. Initially a staunch supporter of Zanu-PF policies, in later years he criticised Robert Mugabe's autocratic rule. In 1992 Zvobgo was moved to the less influential post of Minister of Mines. In 1996 he survived a car accident, in which both his legs were broken. This accident was considered suspicious by many. Shortly after the accident Mugabe demoted Zvobgo further to Minister Without Portfolio, and, in 2000, he was dropped from the cabinet altogether. In the 2002 presidential elections, he refused to campaign for Mugabe, but did not endorse the opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). He also voiced his opposition to the sweeping media law, passed the same year, calling it \"the most serious assault on our constitutional liberties since independence\". Despite his criticism, Zvobgo eventually voted for the legislation, which was used to close off Zimbabwe's only privately owned daily newspaper, The Daily News, and to arrest at least 31 independent journalists. He became the subject of an internal party disciplinary inquiry in 2003 for his refusal to campaign for Mugabe and after describing the laws as a weapon to stifle opposition to the government, but allegations of disloyalty were eventually dropped. Zvobgo had also been accused of holding private talks with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change as the ruling party abandoned formal dialogue between the two parties. Zvobgo died on 22 August 2004 after a lengthy battle with cancer. His wife Julia Tukai Zvobgo, a former Zanu-PF MP, died in February 2004 at the age of 67. He is survived by his seven children, Kerina, Edson Junior, Tsungirirai, Jonasi, Esther, Tendai and Farai Emily."

  "text" : "Emery Oakland Barnes, OBC (December 15, 1929 – July 1, 1998) was a Canadian professional football player and politician. Born in Louisiana and raised in Oregon, Barnes was a gifted athlete, and was an alternate high jumper for the 1952 US Olympic Track and Field team. He played football at the University of Oregon (from where he received his B.Sc) and was selected by the National Football League's Green Bay Packers in the 1954 NFL Draft (10th round, 207th overall.) He played two games for the Packers in 1956, but had much more success in the Canadian Football League with the B.C. Lions. He played 3 years, from 1962 to 1964, for a total of 30 games and was champion in 1964 (though an injury prevented him from playing in the Grey Cup game.) He also received a Bachelor of Social Work degree from the University of British Columbia. Barnes worked as a social worker before entering politics. First elected to the British Columbia legislature in 1972, and re-elected four consecutive times, he served the people of British Columbia until 1996. Barnes and fellow NDP MLA Rosemary Brown were the first black politicians elected to a legislative office in British Columbia in the 20th century. He was particularly concerned with issues relating to social justice, human rights, and poverty. Elected Speaker of the Legislature in 1994, he was also the first black person to hold this position in any Canadian province. The city of Vancouver has named a park after him in his memory: Emery Barnes Park at 1100 Seymour Street. Barnes was appointed to the Order of British Columbia in 1995. He is buried in Robinson Memorial Park Cemetery, in Coquitlam, British Columbia. The headstone shows his full name as \"Emery Oakland Barnes.\" Constance Barnes, a daughter of his, was an elected member of the Vancouver Park Board and is standing for the 2015 federal election with the NDP in the riding of Vancouver Centre."

  "text" : "Edmond Anthony Lapierre (25 January 1866 – 20 June 1960) was a Liberal party member of the Canadian House of Commons. He was born in Montreal and became a sales representative. Lapierre attended St. Mary's Academy in Montreal. He worked with Greenshields in that city for 18 years. Moving to northern Ontario, he became a member of Sudbury's Board of Trade and was a director of the Mattawa Fur Company, and served on various associations. He was first elected to Parliament at the Nipissing riding in the 1921 general election after an unsuccessful campaign as a Laurier Liberal there in the 1917 election. Lapierre was re-elected in 1925 over Conservative candidate John Ferguson, and in 1926 over Conservative candidate and former Sudbury mayor Alfred Laberge. He left federal politics at the end of his term in the 16th Canadian Parliament and did not seek another term in the 1930 election. He was subsequently a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for the provincial Liberals from 1934 to 1937."

Luard was educated at Felsted School and King's College, Cambridge where he gained a First in Modern Languages. In 1950, Luard joined the Foreign Service and after learning Chinese he was stationed in Peking from 1952 to 1954. In 1956 he resigned from the diplomatic service in protest at Britain's involvement in the Suez Crisis. He became a research fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford in 1957 where he was able to research Chinese relations with Britain. He was a Labour councillor on Oxford City Council 1958–61. Luard was Member of Parliament (MP) for Oxford from 1966 to 1970 and again from October 1974 to 1979 for the Labour Party, having first contested the seat in 1964; he was the only Labour member ever to represent the constituency in its original form. He served as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Foreign Office from 1969 till 1970 and again from 1976 until Labour left power in 1979. Luard joined the SDP soon after its formation, and contested the 1983 General election for the party in the newly formed constituency of Oxford West and Abingdon. He was de-selected in 1987 in favour of Chris Huhne. Luard is also known for his sociological theories including the hierarchy theory. His exhaustive study of war, War in International Society: A Study in International Sociology, was published in Britain in 1986 and by Yale University Press in the United States in 1987."

The eldest of John and Mary Fullerton's 20 children, Eddie emigrated to Scotland at the age of 18, and then moved to England. He became involved in Irish republicanism in Birmingham, where he also met and married his wife Diana. They returned to Ireland in 1975. He was elected to Donegal County Council for Sinn Féin in 1979, and held his seat until his assassination at age 56. At two o'clock in the morning, on 25 May 1991, Fullerton and his wife were woken by the sound of their front door being knocked in with a sledgehammer. Ulster loyalist paramilitaries shot Eddie six times from the stairs as he left the bedroom to investigate the noise. A month later, a documentary on British television revealed that a police file from Royal Ulster Constabulary intelligence containing Fullerton's photograph and details was found in the possession of the UDA in Derry. The weapon used to kill him was recovered two years later. The perpetrators were never found. The Fullerton family has long campaigned for an independent public inquiry into the events surrounding his death. This was the third assassination of an elected representative in the Republic of Ireland since its independence from the United Kingdom."

  "text" : "Edmund Leverett Morris (4 February 1923 – 3 January 2003) was a Canadian politician, broadcaster and university administrator. Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Morris attended school at Saint Mary's Boys School. After graduating high school, he pursued an undergraduate and graduate degree in political science from Dalhousie University. After graduation he went to work for a local radio station in Halifax. He was married to Lorraine Ware and had six children. In the 1953 federal election, Morris made his first attempt into politics when he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the electoral district of Halifax. Although he lost, he continued to be involved in politics at the local level, and offered himself for election again in the 1957 election, in which he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada. Between 1957 and 1963, Morris represented the riding of Halifax in the House of Commons. He held the positions of Parliamentary Secretary to the Postmaster General, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Commerce. In 1963, Morris was appointed as chief assistant to the President of Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Saint Mary's, a Catholic university administered by the Society of Jesus, saw Morris serving as one of the few lay persons on staff. Morris was instrumental in large scale building programs at the university throughout the 1960s as well as the eventual change of the university to non-denominational institution in 1970. Morris served as Interim President of Saint Mary's University during the school year 1970–1971. Between 1974 and 1980, Morris served as Mayor of the City of Halifax. After stepping down as Mayor of Halifax, Morris, entered provincial politics by standing as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the urban riding of Halifax Needham, during a by-election, on 6 May 1980. Morris won the seat by 26 votes. Morris was re-elected in 1981 and 1984. Morris served as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Municipal Affairs, Fisheries and Social Services. Morris received an honorary degree, Doctor of Civil Law, from Saint Mary's University in 1986. Morris died on 3 January 2003, at age 79."

A member of the Reform Party, Harper was the only MP from that party ever elected anywhere east of Manitoba. He defeated Liberal candidate Janice Laking, the incumbent mayor of Barrie, by a margin of 123 votes. Ironically, political analysts largely credited his victory over Laking to her popularity rather than his, suggesting that many voters in Barrie switched their votes only because they didn't want Laking to step down as mayor. Harper did not stand for reelection in the 1997 election. Before being elected to Parliament, Harper was a businessman in Barrie."

  "text" : "Edgar Crow Baker (September 16, 1845 – November 3, 1920) was a Canadian politician from British Columbia. Baker was born in Lambeth, then part of Surrey, England, the son of Edward William Whitley Baker, and was educated at the Royal Hospital School in Greenwich. In 1860, he entered the Royal Navy, serving as a navigating lieutenant and retiring at the rank of major in 1878. In 1869, he married Frances Mary Jones. He settled in Victoria, British Columbia and became a prominent accountant, real estate conveyancer and notary. Baker, often known as Crow Baker professionally, prospered and became one of the wealthiest men in the city. Baker served as the Grandmaster of the Masonic Grand Lodge of British Columbia. He entered civic politics as an alderman in Victoria. Baker switched to federal politics when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald vacated his seat in the Victoria district to return to an Ontario seat. He was elected to parliament as a Conservative, along with colleague Noah Shakespeare in the 1882 federal election. Baker was re-elected in 1887 but would later resign his seat, in 1889."

  "text" : "(For other people named Edward Drummond, see Edward Drummond (disambiguation).) Edward Drummond (30 March 1792 – 25 January 1843) was a British civil servant, and was Personal Secretary to several British Prime Ministers. He was fatally shot by Daniel M'Naghten, whose subsequent trial gave rise to the M'Naghten Rules, the legal test of insanity used in many common law jurisdictions. Drummond was a scion of the family who owned and ran Drummonds Bank. He was the second son of Charles Drummond, a banker, and his wife, Frances Dorothy (herself the second daughter of the Reverend Edward Lockwood). He joined the civil service in June 1814, becoming a clerk at the Treasury. He was Private Secretary to a succession of British Prime Ministers: George Canning, Lord Goderich, the 1st Duke of Wellington, and Robert Peel. On 20 January 1843, while serving as Personal Secretary to Peel, he was shot by Daniel M'Naghten (or McNaughton), who had developed delusions about the Tory government. Drummond emerged from Peel's house in Whitehall Gardens at about 4pm, and set off to walk to his apartment in Downing Street. M'Naghten mistook him for Peel and shot him in the back. The ball passed through his chest and diaphragm, lodging in his abdomen. The ball was removed later that day, but despite medical treatment, Drummond died five days later, at Charlton, near Woolwich, and was buried in the vaults of St Luke's Church, Charlton on 31 January. M'Naghten was later tried for murder but found not guilty by reason of insanity. The M'Naghten Rules developed by the House of Lords after his trial were to establish the basis for the insanity defence in all common law countries."

Byrne was forced to step down from cabinet in 2006 after it was revealed that he and several other legislators had exceeded their constituency allowance claims, which led to a criminal investigation. He resigned from the Assembly at the end of that year. In 2009, he was convicted of defrauding the Crown of in excess of CAD$100,000 and influence peddling (known more formally in Newfoundland and Labrador as fraud against the government)."

  "text" : "Edwin Gerald \"Ed\" Allen (March 8, 1920 – January 10, 2001) was a New Brunswick politician. He served in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1978 to 1987 and again from 1991 to 1995. His son, Mike Allen, later became a member of the Canadian House of Commons. He was first elected to the then-safe Progressive Conservative seat of Fredericton North in the 1978 election that produced a nearly deadlocked legislature. He sat as a backbench supporter of Premier Richard Hatfield until after the 1982 election, in which the Conservatives won a large majority, when he was named to the cabinet as Minister of Supply and Services. He was defeated in the 1987 election which saw the PC Party lose all of its seats. Following his defeat, he became a member of the new Confederation of Regions Party, known as CoR, which was formed by many anglophone conservatives. Running under the CoR banner he was re-elected to his old seat in 1991. CoR formed the official opposition and he became house leader. He did not seek re-election in 1995."

  "text" : "Hoos was born in Neuwied am Rhine, Germany on August 31, 1850. He was an upholster and after immigrating to the United States, started a furniture business in Jersey City. His wife Dora Wilkins, of Hanover, Germany, died in 1890. In 1897, he was pushed by Democratic political boss, Robert Davis, to run for Mayor of Jersey City. The mayoral election of 1897 was very controversial. The Republican controlled state legislature passed the McArthur Act which postponed Jersey City and Newark's elections from the Spring to November to make them coincide with the state elections. The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that this was unconstitutional. The Republicans appealed the Supreme Court's decision to the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals. Since the decision was under appeal, the Republicans claimed that the elections planned for April 14 should not be held at that time until the court ruled on their appeal and if they were held then their results would not be valid until after the appeal was ruled on. The Democrats claimed they would be held and their results would be valid. Hoos won the election against Republican J. Herbert Potts, 15,264 votes to 12,018. however, Mayor Peter F. Wanser refused to vacate the mayor's office claiming the election was not valid until their appeal was heard in court. Hoos had to formally demand Wanser to leave the office on May 3, 1897. The New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals ruled in September in favor of Hoos. Hoos won re-election over Republican Edward M. Watson by an even bigger margin of 7,000 votes on April 11, 1899. Hoos had served two terms (May 3, 1897 to December 31, 1901), but Boss Davis knew the voters wanted a change and dumped Hoos from the ticket in 1901 in favor of Edward L. Young (New Jersey), son of Edward Faitoute Condict Young (Davis' financial backing). It did not matter to the voters who swept in Republican Mark M. Fagan as mayor. Hoos died on October 24, 1912 and was buried in New York Bay Cemetery in Jersey City alongside his wife and three of his children."

Seymour ran a butter and egg business in New York City. He was one of the founders of the Bayonne Democratic Club. He was also a leader of the Volunteer and Exempt Firemen of Bayonne. He was chairman of the Board of Directors of Bayonne Hospital. Seymour died on February 6, 1921 in his home of influenza at age 70. He is buried in Bayview/New York Bay Cemetery in Jersey City.

  "text" : "Edwin George Gooch (15 January 1889 – 2 August 1964) was a British Labour Party politician and trade union leader. Gooch was born in Wymondham, Norfolk. He was appointed an Alderman for Norfolk County Council. Later, in 1935, when Wymondham Urban District Council was created, Gooch became the first Chairman of the new UDC and held the office for most of the period up to 1946. His wife, Ethel Gooch, became the council's first lady member in 1935 and its first lady Chairman in 1951. Gooch was elected President of the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers in 1928 and held the position until his death in 1964. At the 1931 general election, he was an unsuccessful candidate in the Conservative-held South Norfolk constituency. Gooch did not contest the 1935 general election, but at the 1945 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament for North Norfolk, defeating the Conservative MP Thomas Cook. He held the seat until his death shortly before the 1964 general election, aged 75. He was chairman of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee from 1955 to 1956."

Villiers was the son of Reverend Charles Villiers of Croft, Yorkshire, and his wife Florence Mary (née Tyssen-Amherst). His great-grandfather, the Hon. George Villiers, was the third son of Thomas Villiers, 1st Earl of Clarendon. Educated at Uppingham School and Peterhouse, Cambridge, he was ordained as an Anglican priest. After three years as a curate in Halifax, he became rector of Haveringland, Norfolk. Villiers married the Hon. Elaine Augusta, daughter of Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, in 1898. The couple had 2 sons and 2 daughters. He resigned from holy orders to pursue a political career, and was elected to the House of Commons for Brighton at a by-election on 5 April 1905 caused by the appointment of one of the two members as a minister. He won the by-election by 817 votes and held the seat at the 1906 general election, increasing his majority to 853, but then chose not to contest the January 1910 general election. Villiers died at his residence, Speen Court, Newbury, Berkshire in September 1923, aged 59. He was buried in the graveyard of Speen Parish Church."

She defeated Liberal candidate Sidney Buckwold, a mayor of Saskatoon who had also lost to Henry Jones in the 1963 election. She sat as a member of the Progressive Conservative caucus. Jones did not stand for reelection in the 1965 election, returning instead to her work as a psychiatrist."

Fage was forced to take a leave of absence from the party caucus in January 2007 after allegations that he had engaged in criminal behaviour following a car accident on November 24, 2006. Fage was subsequently charged criminally with leaving the scene of an accident. Witnesses reported that Fage smelled of alcohol at the time of the accident, but he was not charged with an alcohol-related offense due to lack of evidence. He was found guilty of leaving the scene of an accident, and fined $800, on December 18, 2007, and it was subsequently announced he would not be allowed back into caucus. Prior to the verdict Fage said he planned on running in the next election. He continued to sit as an independent MLA until the 2009 election, when he was defeated by Brian Skabar — notably, however, Fage finished in second place ahead of Keith Hunter, his replacement as the Progressive Conservative candidate. He had also previously been involved in a controversy around a government loan to a potato farm with which he had a personal business connection."

Miles served in a loyalist unit during the American Revolution and came to New Brunswick after the war, settling in Maugerville. In 1779, he married Frances Cornwell, a descendant of Thomas Cornell.  Miles was a captain in the King's New Brunswick Regiment from 1793 to 1802. He married Elizabeth Harding in 1800 after the death of his first wife. He was elected to the provincial assembly in 1802 after a number of voters who had voted for Samuel Denny Street were found to be ineligible by the sheriff. Miles was an unsuccessful candidate in 1809 but was elected in the three elections that followed. During his time in the assembly, Miles never opposed measures introduced by the government. He was a magistrate for Sunbury County and served as a justice for the Inferior Court of Common Pleas. Miles died in Maugerville at the age of 78. His son Thomas also represented the county in the provincial assembly. Although Miles himself was a member of the Church of England, his son Frederick William Miles became a Baptist minister and was president of the first Baptist seminary in the province."

He became a trade union organiser in 1928 and worked in that role until 1941 when he was elected unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Doncaster, having unsuccessfully contested the seat of Rossendale in 1935 and having been prospective candidate for West Toxteth in 1939. From 1944 to 1945 he was parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of National Insurance. Re-elected in the 1945 general election, he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of Food, and served in this role until 1946. In 1947, in the course of an investigation by the parliamentary Committee of Privileges into claims that Labour members had given information to journalists about confidential meetings of the Labour Party in return for payment, Walkden admitted revealing information to the Evening News. He was found guilty of breach of privilege by the Committee and reprimanded by the Speaker. Another MP, Garry Allighan, was expelled from the House, but Walkden was not as he admitted the offence and had paid tax on the money he had been paid. He resigned the party whip and sat as an independent until the 1950 election, in which he did not stand. Lord Robens commented after his death that Walkden was \"an able Trade Union official and an able Parliamentarian and worked hard to bring about reforms in the rationing systems during the war. He was a thorn in the side of the black marketeers and his activities led to the closing of many loopholes.\""

It has been alleged that on February 28th 2002, he was killed by a mob armed with machetes when he pleaded with them to spare the lives of the women and children who had taken refuge in his home. The Special Investigating Team concluded that he was killed after he fired at an agitated mob outside his house. His widow Zakia Jafri has subsequently argued that the state of Gujarat and its then Chief Minister, now the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, was partly responsible for the violence and for the lack of police intervention in favor of the victims at Gulbarg Society. This argument has been rejected by a Special Investigation Committee which concluded that Modi had no responsibility for the incident."

Ignatius Chombo, the Minister of Local Government, had not sworn in the new local administrations, and because the elected Harare councillors were not allowed to meet at Harare's Town House, they met elsewhere to elect Chiroto. On the night of June 16, Chiroto's house in the suburb of Hatcliffe was attacked and destroyed by ZANU-PF supporters; Chiroto believed that petrol bombs were used. Chiroto's wife, Abigail, and his four-year-old son were taken away by the attackers, although his son was delivered to a police station on June 16. Chiroto himself was not present when the attack occurred. His wife was later found murdered on June 18, 2008 at a farm in outlying Borrowdale. Chiroto went into hiding following this incident."

He was the son of John William Hatch of London and Matilda Augusta Snell of Callington, Cornwall. Following a private education, he went into business as a wine merchant, and in 1894 established Hatch, Mansfield and Company. Hatch was unsuccessful Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Gorton Division of Lancashire at a by-election in 1889 and at the succeeeding general election in 1892. On his third attempt, in the 1895 election, he was elected as Gorton's MP. Hatch remained as Conservative member for Gorton until 1904, when his disagreement with Joseph Chamberlain over free trade led to him crossing the floor to the Liberal Party. At the next general election in 1906 he had little support from Liberal activists for his candidature, and accordingly withdrew. In 1908 he was created a baronet, \"of Portland Place, in the Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone\". He was appointed chairman and treasurer of University College Hospital, London During the First World War he chaired the Government Commission on Belgian Refugees, and was made a commander of the Belgian Order of the Crown. He was also Chairman of Council of the Beyond Seas Association for Reception of Officers and Relatives from beyond the seas, and for this he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1920 New Year Honours. Ernest Hatch married Lady Constance Blanche Godolphin Osborne in 1900, aunt of John Osborne, later Duke of Leeds. They had one daughter, and the baronetcy became extinct on Sir Edward's death in 1927."

  "text" : "Edward Ryley (or Riley) Langworthy (1797 - 7 April 1874) was a British businessman and Liberal politician. Langworthy was born in London, the son of a Somerset merchant. After spending some years in South and Central America, he moved to Salford, Lancashire in 1840 to establish a cotton business with his brother, George. Langworthy Brothers and Company was established at Greengate Mills. When Salford was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1844, Langworthy was elected as the first alderman for Trinity ward. He was the borough's fifth mayor, elected for two consecutive terms from 1848 to 1850. His term as mayor saw the establishment of the free public museum and library at Peel Park In January 1857, Salford's Liberal member of parliament, Joseph Brotherton, died. Langworthy was selected as the party's candidate for the vacancy, and as the only nominee, was elected unopposed on 2 February. Following his election he gave a speech outlining his political views: he supported the temperance movement, free trade and civil and religious freedom, the reform of parliament, strengthened local government, but opposed any increase in the size of the country's armed forces. He was only Salford's MP for a matter of months, as he did not stand at the subsequent general election later in the year. Langworthy retained his connection with Salford Corporation, and on his death in 1874 left £10,000 to the museum and library he had helped establish. Langworthy Road, constructed shortly after his death, was named in his memory by Salford Borough Council."

  "text" : "Eleanor Elizabeth Tucker Norrie (born 1942) is a former teacher, restaurant owner and politician in Nova Scotia, Canada. She represented Truro-Bible Hill in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1993 to 1998 as a Liberal member. Norrie was born in Tatamagouche Mountain, Nova Scotia and was educated at Colchester County Academy and the provincial normal school. Norrie entered provincial politics in the 1993 election, defeating former Progressive Conservative MLA Jack Coupar by 187 votes in the Truro-Bible Hill riding. In June 1993, Norrie was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of the Civil Service. She became Minister of Human Resources later that year when the Civil Service Commission was replaced with the Department of Human Resources. In March 1995, Norrie was shuffled to Minister of Housing and Consumer Affairs. In March 1996, Norrie was named Minister of Natural Resources. She was dropped from the cabinet when Russell MacLellan took over as premier in July 1997. Norrie reoffered in the 1998 election, but was defeated by Progressive Conservative Jamie Muir. She later served as the president of the Liberal association for the federal riding of Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley."

  "text" : "Ebenezer Walden (1777–1857) was mayor of Buffalo, New York, serving in 1838–1839. He was born in 1777 in Massachusetts. In 1799, he graduated from Williams College, then made his way to Oneida County, New York where he studied law. In 1806, he was admitted to the New York State bar and moved to Buffalo. For nearly two years Walden was the only lawyer west of Batavia. He invested heavily in real estate in this area, owning what became known as Walden Farm at what is now Fillmore and Walden Avenue. In 1812, he married Suzanna Marvin. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Cattaraugus, Chautauqua and Niagara Co.) in 1812. During the War of 1812 Walden leased land to the Federal government and the Buffalo Barracks are erected. The front portion of the barracks later became what is the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site. He was one of the few who stayed behind during the burning of Buffalo and trying to save as many lives as possible. Walden's home was used by General Winfield Scott as his headquarters. After the war, he erected the first brick dwelling in Buffalo. He was one of the four original trustees of the village of Buffalo and served as a member of the Buffalo Harbor Company, which improved Buffalo's harbor to attract the village as the western terminus of the Erie Canal. Walden became the first judge of Erie County Court in 1823 and held the position for five years. He was a presidential elector in 1828. On March 13, 1838, the Common Council met and made Walden its choice for mayor. During his term, the entire school system was reorganized. After his term as mayor, Walden retired to his farm in Lake View, New York. He died there on November 10, 1857, and was buried in the Myer-Walden mausoleum in Forest Lawn Cemetery."

He was appointed city attorney in 1845, and again in 1851. He was elected mayor on March 1, 1853, as the Democratic candidate. During his term the city charter was revised to make the mayor's term two years and the Common Council would elect its own presiding officer; the mayor would no longer be president. Additionally, many of the city offices that were filled by Council appointment were now to be elective. The charter also annexed Black Rock into the city of Buffalo. He was reelected for a second term on November 8, 1853, as the first two-year Buffalo mayor, and the first mayor to serve consecutive terms. After serving as mayor he returned to his law practice.

Myers graduated from teacher's college and taught school for several years. He went on to study medicine at Queen's University, graduating in 1908. After graduating, Myers practised medicine with his cousins who operated a clinic in Moncton, New Brunswick. In 1910, he travelled west, planning to set up practice in Saskatoon. He was persuaded instead to come to Rosetown. In 1913, he opened a private hospital there which closed the following year after the Rosetown Hospital was opened. Myers also owned a farm where he raised horses, some as racehorses. He was defeated by Archibald M. Carmichael when he ran for reelection to the House of Commons in 1921. Myers retired from his practice in 1948, although he continued to see the occasional patient. He is said to have delivered over 4,000 babies during his career. In 1950, he was given a life membership by the Saskatchewan College of Physicians and Surgeons for his many years of service. He died in Rosetown at the age of 82."

Joyce was first elected in the 1989 election — however, as party leader Clyde Wells had been defeated by Lynn Verge in his own riding despite leading the Liberal Party to victory, Joyce stepped aside to allow Wells to contest the seat in a by-election. He worked in the executive offices of Wells and his successor as Premier, Brian Tobin, until the 1999 election, when he ran for office again in Bay of Islands. He won the seat and served until the 2007 election, when he was defeated by Terry Loder. In October 2010, Joyce announced that he would re-seek the Liberal nomination, and in the 2011 provincial election he defeated Loder to reclaim his old seat. On July 18, 2013 Joyce was named Leader of the Opposition and interim Liberal leader, replacing Dwight Ball who resigned to run for the provincial leadership permanently in the party's 2013 convention."

  "text" : "Ebenezer Hamlin (1844 – 4 June 1900) was a member of parliament in New Zealand, and an independent conservative. Hamlin was born in Orua on the Manukau Harbour to the Rev James Hamlin, a missionary who had arrived in New Zealand in 1823 with the Church Missionary Society. He was the ninth and youngest son of the reverent. He fought in the New Zealand Wars in the 1860s, and was a Major in the Territorial Army. On 28 April 1868, Hamlin married Sarah Grace Barriball, the daughter of Charles Barriball of Waiuku, at his father's house near Waiuku (Barriball Road in Waiuku commemorates the location of the family's land). Electors from Waiuku presented a requisition to Hamlin in November 1869 to stand for election in the Raglan electorate for the Auckland Provincial Council, which he accepted. Three representatives were elected on 20 December, and of four candidates, Joseph May came first and Hamlin came second. Hamlin remained a member of the provincial council until the abolition of provincial government in 1875. He represented the South Auckland seats of Franklin in the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1876 to 1881; and then the replacement electorate of Franklin South from 1881 to 1890. He then represented the reconstituted Franklin electorate from 1890 to 1893 when he retired. He was never defeated. He served as Chairman of Committees from 1882 to 1890. He died at his residence in the Auckland suburb of Remuera on 4 June 1900. He was survived by his wife, three sons, and seven daughters."

His father's family were publishers to the University of Edinburgh. After receiving a good education, McGlashan worked in the book trade. Inspired by his brother's work as secretary for the Otago Association, he decided to emigrate and left in 1848. He went to Adelaide in South Australia, then Melbourne and finally Sydney, where he sold the books that he took with him for a good profit. There, he purchased provisions that he took with himself to Dunedin in 1850, which he could once again sell at a good profit. In 1853, he was joined in Dunedin by his older brother, John McGlashan. Edward McGlashan worked at first as a registrar at the Supreme Court under Justice Sidney Stephen. He then leased a flour mill from William Henry Valpy on the Water of Leith. He also had a store and auction room in Princes Street. From 1858 until 1862, when the Otago Gold Rush began, he was in partnership with W. Carr Young, and they traded as Young and McGlashan. McGlashan visited England in 1862. Edward McGlashan stood for election in the first Otago Provincial Council, and represented the Dunedin Country electorate from 28 September 1853 to 15 September 1855. He was unsuccessful at some later provincial elections. In 1865, he contested the superintendancy, but was beaten by Thomas Dick. He would later represent the North Harbour electorate in the 6th and 7th council, from 17 March 1871 until the abolition of the provincial governments on 31 October 1876. He represented the City of Dunedin electorate from the 1860 general election to 1862 when he resigned; and then the Roslyn electorate from the 1871 general election to 1875, when he resigned. McGlashan had various business interests later in life. He dealt in stock and farmland, and owned Mount Stokes station. He owned steamers and was milling in The Catlins. He started to manufacture paper, but was unsuccessful in making it from tussock grasses. He moved to Timaru for some years and was a director of a number of companies, including a major shareholder in the New Zealand Shipping Company. After a long visit to England from 1881, he returned to Dunedin to live in St Clair. McGlashan married twice, and his second wife was Henrietta, the daughter of George Bell; they married on 10 March 1880. McGlashan's health was poor for his last few years. He died on 31 July 1889 at his residence in St Clair, and was survived by his second wife."

  "text" : "Edmund Barff (5 March 1833 – 29 June 1882) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament from the West Coast, New Zealand. Barff was born in the English county of Kent on 5 March 1833, probably at Lee (now part of Greater London), where he was baptised five months later. He first came to New Zealand to join the West Coast Gold Rush in the mid-1860s. The West Coast was initially part of the Canterbury Province and following a requisition in October 1865, he was first elected as the member of the West Coast Goldfields electorate in the following month. Barff and Evan Prosser, who was elected at the same time, were the first members from the West Coast on the Canterbury Provincial Council. In July 1866, Barff became a member for the Westland electorate. He remained a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council until December 1867. The Westland district separated from the Canterbury Province on 1 January 1868, and Barff joined the Westland County, which was the predecessor to Westland Province. During the existence of Westland County (January 1868 – November 1873), Barff represented the ridings of Westland, Ōkārito, and Arahura. He did not join the Westland Provincial Council, but stood for the first election in January 1874 as one of three candidates in the two-member Arahura electorate (incorrectly referred to as 'Waimea' in some sources). Much to his surprise, he was defeated with 120 votes by Richard Seddon and Houlahan, who were equal at 145 votes. He represented the Westland South electorate in the House of Representatives from 1868 to 1870, when he was defeated for Hokitika by John White. He then represented the Hokitika electorate from 1876 to 1879, when he was again defeated. Barff died in Kumara in 1882; he had never married."

He narrowly lost to Labour Party candidate Phil Woolas for the Oldham East and Saddleworth seat in the 2010 general election, but the result was overturned by an election court, which found that Woolas had knowingly lied about Watkins' personal character. Watkins had stood down as a councillor representing Healey Ward on Rochdale Council in order to contest the general election. He was selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for the constituency in late 2007. In 2008, during his time as a Rochdale councillor, Watkins said he was planning to seek legal advice after Phil Woolas' election agent suggested he had \"abandoned his constituents and moved to the Middle East to work for a multi-billionaire sheikh\"."

His prominent North Knoxville mansion, Greystone, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A Union officer during the Civil War, Camp arrived in Knoxville in 1865. In 1868, he killed Confederate colonel Henry Ashby in a notorious shootout in downtown Knoxville. Camp first rose to prominence as U.S. District Attorney for East Tennessee, serving from 1869 until 1871. During the late 1860s, he organized the Coal Creek Coal Company, which in subsequent decades grew to become one of the major coal producing companies in the region. In the 1890s, Camp helped establish Knoxville's Florence Crittenton Home and Camp's Home for Friendless Women."

  "text" : "Edgerton Winnett Day (November 26, 1863 – February 11, 1919) was a Canadian politician and pioneer settler in the area that became province of Alberta, Canada. Born in 1863 in an area later incorporated into the Canadian province of Ontario, Day completed his education, and took up a job as a stagecoach driver. Soon after, he would find employment at the Massey-Harris company, an agricultural equipment manufacturer. During this time, Day first surveyed the land that he would eventually settle later on in his life. After briefly working as a loan company, Day moved to the west, after having aspirations of doing so since his youth. As the Canadian Pacific Railway gained entitlement to a portion of land in the prairies, Day became interested in purchasing a large portion, and did so in 1904. He then completed plans for what would later become the town that bears his name, Daysland, in present-day Flagstaff County, Alberta. Daysland was formed in 1905, when the railway line to the area was completed. Soon after, a large colonial-style house was built as a home for Day and his wife. Fitted with the latest appliances and technology at the time, it soon became the centre of the town, serving as an ice rink and tennis court, and hosting events, including auctions. After the opening of a post office in 1907, Daysland was officially incorporated as a town, with Day elected its first mayor. He would continue to serve in the capacity until his resignation in 1910. Two years later, Day moved to Edmonton, where he served as a major in the Army Reserve until his death from a long illness in 1919."

Pimbury apprenticed in the drug business and, unable to purchase a business in England, travelled to Portland, Maine and then to Portage, Wisconsin, where he established a business. In 1856, following a downturn in the economy, he journeyed to California, but finding his opportunities there limited, went prospecting for gold in Arizona. He then left for British Columbia with his brother. Pimbury farmed for a time with his brothers near Victoria but then took a job in a drug business in Victoria. After eleven years, he returned to farming. He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the assembly in 1871. Pimbury later established a retail business selling drugs, books and stationery at Nanaimo. He did not run for reelection in 1882 due to the demands of his business. Pimbury was a director of the Waterworks Company at Nanaimo and also served as a justice of the peace. He died in Duncan at the age of 75."

Washer and Christopher Lawne represented Lawne's Plantation as burgesses in the first assembly of the Virginia House of Burgesses, the lower house of the colonial Virginia General Assembly, in 1619. \"Ensign\" is a military grade or rank, not the colonist's first name, and there is some suggestion that he was a lower ranking military officer before he arrived in Virginia. He also would have been a member of the local militia after his arrival in Virginia. Sources seem to be uniform in their identification of Washer as \"Ensign\" and only one source has been found which states that his name was \"Thos\" (Thomas). Even if this is true and can be verified, the colonist is shown as Ensign Washer here because that is how he is shown in sources which identify him as a member of the first session of the House of Burgesses. Before 1619, Ensign Washer, Captain Nathaniel Basse and Giles Jones received patents for land along the Pagan River. Captain Christopher Lawne then settled near the mouth of Lawne's Creek in the same vicinity. Although the area was known as Lawne's Plantation and its representatives were listed as representatives from the plantation, the colonists also had named the area \"Warresqueak County\" after the Native American tribe who lived there. Washer and Christopher Lawne represented Lawne's Plantation in the first assembly of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1619. In 1620, a movement began to change the name of \"Warresqueak County\" to \"Isle of Wight County\" but this was not done until 1637. The Daughters of the American Revolution state that Ensign Washer had a daughter named Margaret (Polly). Little if anything more is known about Ensign Washer or what may have become of him. Records do not show him as among the dead of the Indian massacre of 1622 nor do they list him in the muster of 1624. Yet his name survives as a member of the first representative assembly in the areas that would become both the State of Virginia and the United States of America."

He resigned in 1918 to become Agent-General for South Australia, a role he held until 1925. Lucas was born in County Cavan, Ireland, and was educated at Bailieborough. He worked as a draper's apprence in Dublin, before migrating to South Australia in 1878. He initially worked for John Martin & Co., but established his own drapery in North Adelaide in 1882, and built a partnership with several stores. Lucas moved to Gawler in 1886, purchasing the business of J. & J. Wilcox, which he operated until 1901; he also maintained stores in Adelaide, Hamley Bridge and Balaklava, only selling the latter in 1918. He was mayor of the Corporate Town of Gawler in 1893 and 1894, served as president of the Gawler Institute, and was involved with the School of Mines, School Board of Advice, and the committee supporting the Barossa Water Scheme. He married Frances Louisa Johnston in 1885, but she died following the birth of their first child. He remarried in 1890, to Mabel Florence Brock. Lucas was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council in 1900, representing the Midland District. He was involved in the merger that created the state's first united conservative party, the Liberal Union in 1910, and served as its leader in the Legislative Council from 1913. During World War I, he was a member of the State War Council and was vice-chairman of the State Recruiting Committee. In 1918, he was appointed Agent-General in London, serving until 1925. In this role, he was tasked with representing South Australia in England through the aftermath of the war; while there, he was knighted in 1921, and was a commissioner of the British Empire Exhibition in 1924. He was involved in a wide range of community organisations, including the Navy League, which he served as state president of for many years, the District and Bush Nursing Society, the Prisoners' Aid Society, and the YMCA. He was a lay preacher in the Methodist Church, and represented it on the Council of Churches. He made a final bid for political office at the 1928 federal election, unsuccessfully contesting a Senate seat for the Nationalist Party. Lucas died in 1950 at his home in Medindie, aged 93, and was buried in Payneham Cemetery. His death was reported in newspapers nationally. He was survived by two daughters; his second wife, one son and one daughter predeceased him."

He represented Similkameen in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1953 as a Social Credit member. Gunderson served as president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Alberta in 1936. He was first elected to the assembly in a 1952 by-election held after Harry Denyer Francis resigned his seat to allow Gunderson to run for a seat in the assembly. Gunderson served briefly in the provincial cabinet as Finance Minister. Although he was unsuccessful when he ran for reelection in the general election held in 1953 and a subsequent by-election later that year, Gunderson continued to serve as financial adviser to W.A.C. Bennett's government. He also served as vice-president of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway and as a director of the British Columbia Toll Bridge and Highways Authority, of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, of Black Ball Ferries Ltd. and of Deeks-McBride Ltd., a cement and gravel supply company. Gunderson was a member of the board of governors for the University of British Columbia from 1957 to 1968. In 1967, he was named provisional chairman of the Bank of British Columbia. Gunderson also served on the board of directors for BC Hydro until the NDP came into power in 1972; he was removed from the board of directors of BC Rail at the same time. He died in Vancouver at the age of 80."

In 2001, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, \"for public and community service\". He first entered parliament as an MP for Nukufetau in a by-election in October 2003. At the time, Prime Minister Saufatu Sopoanga was struggling to retain a majority in parliament. There are no political parties in Tuvalu, and Pita was elected without having said which side of parliament he would join. He considered the matter for several days after his election, then joined the government's side, helping it maintain a majority. In August 2004, however, he crossed the floor, providing the Opposition with the majority it needed to topple the government through a motion of no confidence. Over the following weeks, Opposition leader Maatia Toafa and ousted prime minister Saufatu Sopoanga formed an unexpected alliance. Pita seized the opportunity to challenge for the premiership. A vote in parliament on 11 October made Toafa prime minister with eight votes, Sopoanga serving as his deputy. Pita received seven votes, and became the leader of the Opposition. He held the position until the 2006 general election, after which he sat as a backbencher. From 2008 to 2010, as MP, he was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. He lost his seat in parliament in the 2010 general election, with Enele Sopoanga (brother of the former Prime Minister) replacing him. He subsequently served as Chief Executive of the Tuvalu National Private Sector Organisation, lobbying for \"stronger ties between the private sector and the government\". He was selected as the Opposition's candidate for a crucial by-election in Nukufetau on 28 June 2013, which would determine which side of parliament had a majority. Pita pledged, if elected, to enable the Opposition leader Enele Sopoanga, the man who whose election ousted Pita from parliament, to bid for the premiership. He won the seat with more than two thirds of the vote, and the Opposition immediately asked for parliament to be reconvened. After the subsequent vote of no confidence in the government of Willy Telavi, Elisala Pita was appointed Minister for Works and Natural Resources on 5 August 2013 following Enele Sopoaga becoming prime minister. Following the Tuvaluan general election, 2015 Elisala Pita was re-appointed as the Minister for Works and Natural Resources. Pita died on 22 August 2016 in Funafuti."
