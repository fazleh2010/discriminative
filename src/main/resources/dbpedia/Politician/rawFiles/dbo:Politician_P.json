  "text" : "Philip Francis Little (1824 – October 21, 1897) was the first Premier of Newfoundland Colony between 1855 and 1858. He was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Little studied law there with Charles Young and was admitted to the bar in 1844. He came to Newfoundland in 1846 and articled in law. He got involved in politics only a few years after. He helped lead the charge for responsible government along with John Kent. After it was granted in 1854, he went on to run a successful campaign as leader of the predominantly Roman Catholic Liberal Party. He became Newfoundland's first Premier in 1855 and served concurrently as the colony's Attorney-General. Little only remained in office until July 15, 1858, when he resigned to be succeeded by John Kent. In that time, he managed to secure Newfoundland's autonomy, in making sure Newfoundland had a say over its own destiny. Then Britain and France came with a plan involving the west coast of Newfoundland. Little objected and in a dispatch in 1857, the British cancelled the deal which would have been unfavourable to Newfoundland. He resigned in 1858 saying \"I go now before the milk of Human kindness goes sour for me\". He was right in that Newfoundland was about to enter an era of sectarian strife. Little was appointed as appointed assistant justice on the Supreme Court of Newfoundland in September 1858 and became Chief Justice two months later. In 1861, riots broke out over disputed election results from Harbour Grace. Little, as Chief Justice, played a prominent role in dispersing and calming the crowds. He married into a wealthy Anglo-Irish family in 1864 and retired to Ireland in 1868 and did a great deal for the home rule movement there. He died at the age of 73 in 1897 while living in Monkstown, Ireland. He married Mary Jane Holdright in 1864 and they had 13 children. Their youngest child Patrick Little was a senior Irish politician."

  "text" : "Peter Ernest Hume (born June 19, 1963) was a city councillor in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He represented Alta Vista Ward in the south end of the city. He was considered by some to have been \"the most respected politician in Ottawa\". Hume grew up in the Canterbury area of Alta Vista Ward. He attended Hawthorne Public School and Canterbury High School before graduating with a degree in Economics from Carleton University. He would then work as an assistant to Canterbury Ward councillor Michael McSweeney and then Alta Vista Ward councillor Darrel Kent. Hume was first elected as a city and regional councillor in 1991. In 1994 he was elected to the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton council (when it became an independently elected position). He was re-elected in 1997. In the 2000 Ottawa election, he chose to run against Ottawa city councillor Allan Higdon for city council, as the City of Ottawa and the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton were set to amalgamate the following year. He was able to defeat Higdon, and was acclaimed three years later in the 2003 Ottawa election. In 2002, Hume contributed $362.26 to the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party leadership campaign of Jim Flaherty. Hume is generally considered to be a \"red Tory\", who \"votes in favour of social spending, but talks convincingly about fiscal responsibility.\" In 2004, Hume allowed a private developer to hold a private party to raise money to pay off a debt Hume had received from running for President of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. Both Hume and the host of the party has refused to reveal the guest list to that event. Hume would later serve as President from 2008 to 2011. Hume was easily re-elected in the 2006 municipal elections with 70% of the vote and again in 2010 with 59% of the vote. Hume is currently the Chair of the City of Ottawa's Planning Committee, a position he has held since 2003. On August 22, 2014, Hume announced he would not be seeking re-election as councillor. In 2015, Hume partnered with former Minto vice-president, Jack Stirling, in a \"strategic partnership to pursue development projects and to advise both the private and public sector.\" Stirling, the old City of Nepean’s last planning commissioner before amalgamation, is well-known as another former local bureaucrat who jumped the fence in 2001 to work for Minto as vice-president of development, using his experience to stickhandle development proposals through the city’s Byzantine approvals process."

Kline, a member of the Republican Party, lost re-election as attorney general to Democratic challenger, Johnson County District Attorney Paul Morrison, on November 7, 2006, 58%-41%. Having been appointed by the Republican County Central Committee over Steve Howe to fill the vacancy left by Paul Morrison's election as Kansas Attorney General, Kline became the district attorney of Johnson County on the day he left office as attorney general, essentially switching jobs with Morrison. Kline then ran for a full term as district attorney, but was defeated by Howe in the August 5, 2008, Republican primary. On October 18, 2013, Kline's Kansas law license was indefinitely suspended by the Kansas Supreme Court, which held in a written opinion that there was \"clear and convincing evidence\" that Kline committed 11 violations of conduct rules while he was the state's top law enforcement officer from January 2003 to January 2007 and later as Johnson County's District Attorney. While in office, Kline served as Chairman of the Republican Attorneys' General Association, Co-Chairman of the National Violent Sexual Predator Apprehension Task Force, President of the Midwest Association of Attorneys General, Prosecutor of the Year for the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill and Executive Committee Member of the National Association of Attorneys General. Kline was a polarizing figure in state politics, largely surrounding the issue of abortion. He filed charges against Dr. George Tiller, a late-term abortion provider, and led a years-long effort to prosecute Planned Parenthood in Kansas, which he said had failed to submit reports when young women (15 and younger) came to get abortions."

  "text" : "Paul Egerton Piesse is a former co-leader of the Alliance, a New Zealand political party, and union activist. Piesse has been heavily involved in the union movement, and has held a number of senior organisational roles. He was originally a supporter of the Labour Party, and in 1969 stood for Labour in the Rangiora electorate, coming second. He joined NewLabour in protest at the economic policies Labour pursued (\"Rogernomics\") in the late 1980s. NewLabour eventually helped form the Alliance, and Piesse became involved in the new party. In the 1999 election, he stood as the Alliance candidate in the Christchurch East electorate, winning 6.7% of the vote. He was ranked 58th on the Alliance list. Following the splintering of the Alliance, Piesse sided with the Harré-McCarten faction. In the 2002 election, he stood again as an Alliance candidate, gaining 0.5% of the vote in Waimakariri. He was not on the party list. After Harré and McCarten also left the Alliance, Piesse was elected co-leader, alongside Jill Ovens. In the 2005 election he also stood for the Alliance. Piesse was elected President of the Alliance Party at the 2007 national conference held in Dunedin. In the 2008 election he contested the Christchurch East electorate and was number 4 on the Alliance Party list. He fared poorly, coming eighth with only 119 votes. The Alliance also did badly, winning only 0.08% of the party vote nationwide. In the 2011 election he also stood for the Alliance. As of 2015 Piesse has been a sitting member of the Executive Committee of Converge, a left-wing online community network  as well as being an active participant in Hobgoblin, a similar enterprise. At this time his current activities with the Alliance Party are unknown, the most recent statements of his role as president being in 2011."

  "text" : "Pete Sorenson is a County Commissioner in Lane County, Oregon. Born in Washoe County, Nevada, Sorenson is a lawyer and a progressive member of the Democratic Party. From 1977 to 1979, Sorenson served as a Special Assistant to the Secretary of Agriculture during the Carter Administration. While in private law practice from 1982 to 1995, Sorenson also served as a member of the Board of Education at Lane Community College in Eugene Oregon. During his tenure at Lane Community College, Sorenson advocated strongly for dislocated workers' retraining programs and for childcare for staff and students. In 1993, Sorenson was appointed to the Oregon State Senate, and was elected to a full Senate term in 1994. He was elected Assistant Minority Leader during the 1995 session. Because Oregon term limits at that time prevented Sorenson from running for reelection as a State Senator, he ran for County Commissioner in 1996 and was elected to his first term. He ran successfully for reelection as a County Commissioner in 2000, 2004 and 2008; in 2008 he ran unopposed. In 2009 he was elected by the four other commissioners as Chair of the Board of Commissioners, a position he has held before. Sorenson has always run on a \"pro-environment, pro-education, pro-senior, pro-regular taxpayer, pro-child, pro-civil rights, pro-civil liberties, and pro-people\" platform. In January 2005, Sorenson announced he would challenge incumbent Governor Ted Kulongoski, also a Democrat. Sorenson was defeated in the May 2006 Democratic primary for Governor, receiving 16.27% of the vote. In July 2007 Pete Sorenson and Kim Leval were married. Kim is the Executive Director for the Northwest Center for Alternatives to Pesticides. Sorenson has two grown children: Jennifer, a child welfare worker for the state of Oregon, and Erik, an accountant for Sansome Street Advisors in San Francisco California."

He was voted into council for Ottawa City Council in the Rideau-Rockcliffe Ward at the 2010 municipal election. In January 2011 he expressed in local media he believes safety for pedestrians and cyclists is a priority in the city. He supports the bridge to be built over the Rideau river (in his ward), and said this will create a connection to the Laurier Bike Lane to be built if the draft budget is approved. Earlier he indicated Ottawa has to become a city with 21st-century transportation. He also supported the green bin introduction, despite his reputation for fiscal conservatism."

Wriedt is the daughter of former state Labor leader and Whitlam Government Minister for Agriculture Ken Wriedt. Wriedt was appointed Minister for Education in 1998, becoming the youngest ever female member of Cabinet in Tasmania. As Education Minister, in December 2000, she launched \"Learning Together\", a major policy on education, training and information provision for the state of Tasmania. Learning Together promised a complete overhaul of the state's education system, introducing the Essential Learnings Curriculum as a trial way to assess and teach students. Wriedt also funded the establishment of a number of child care centres co-located with government primary schools, and saw the raising of Tasmania's school leaving age from 16 to 17 years. In 2002 she also became Minister for Women. In 2005, Wriedt initiated the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women to recognise the significant contribution that women have made to Tasmania throughout history. In the 2006 Tasmanian state election Wriedt suffered a decline in her primary vote, almost losing her seat to Liberal challenger Vanessa Goodwin, after criticism of the government over the Essential Learnings Curriculum. After the election, she became Minister for Tourism, Arts and the Environment, while David Bartlett assumed her Education portfolio. Following a cabinet reshuffle in January 2008, Wriedt was appointed Minister for Economic Development and Tourism."

He was the nominee for the Republican and Conservative parties ultimately losing to incumbent Borough President Helen Marshall. Sica's earliest education was at St. Stephen's Elementary School. Sica graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School. He then went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts from Pace University (Government and Business), a B.A. from Atlantic Union College (Religion), attended New York Law School, and did religious graduate work with Andrews University. Sica served New York City in various capacities. He worked in the New York City Department of Hospitals, which is now called the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. He was a senior investigator for the New York City Department of Finance, a NYC Housing Authority Assistant, a detective-investigator for the Queens County District Attorney's Office, and Marshal for the City (mayoral appointment). In 1980, Sica's career changed when he became a minister of various Seventh-day Adventist Churches in the city. Prior to running for borough president, Sica ran for the State Assembly's 24th district in 2000, and lost to Mark Weprin (72% to 28%). Sica then went on to run for Council District 23 in 2001 and lost to David Weprin (Mark's brother) 69% to 31%. During his run for the Council District, Sica outlined his wishes to promote a reduction in crime, the lowering of taxes, and reform of the city's education system through increased investment by the state. In the race for the State Assembly, Sica received the support of the Republican Party, the Conservative Party, and the Right to Life. In his 2001 bid for the City Council, he was additionally endorsed by the Independence Party. Sica was unopposed for the Republican and Conservative parties' nomination in the race for Queens Borough President. Additionally, Borough President Helen Marshall ran unopposed for the nomination of the Democratic and Working Families parties. After counting the absentee ballots and affidavit ballots cast either for Marshall or Sica, the result turned out to be seventy-five percent for Marshall and twenty-five percent for Sica. Sica's strongest assembly district was A.D. 23 (comprising Howard Beach, Ozone Park, and Far Rockaway) where he garnered 39% of the votes cast. Sica is married to Naomi (Jungling) Sica, Ed.D. Sica has four adult children and four grandchildren. Sica is active in the American Legion, having served in the Army's Military Police. On September 18, 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to continue representing the Republicans of the 24th Assembly District in the New York Republican State Committee. In October 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to be a Vice-Chairman of the Queens County Republican Party and is again serving as its Chaplain."

  "text" : "Paul Ainslie (born February 4, 1967) is a city councillor in Toronto, Canada. In 2006, he was appointed as an interim councillor in ward 41, and was then elected as the councillor for Ward 43 in Scarborough East. On February 1, 2006, City Council appointed Ainslie to fill the vacancy in Ward 41 that was created when Bas Balkissoon was elected in a provincial by-election in the riding of Scarborough-Rouge River. A condition of the appointment was that he would not run as a candidate in the 2006 election. However, when councillor David Soknacki announced his intention not to run in Ward 43, Ainslie put his name forward as a candidate to replace him. Ainslie used to be an executive assistant to Soknacki. Soknacki supported Ainslie's candidacy. During the election campaign in 2006, a video surfaced which showed Ainslie promising to Toronto City Council not to run. \"I will not run in Ward 41, or any other ward in the city.\" His campaign literature urged voters to \"return\" him to city hall. He said that his campaign team suggested using the word \"re-elect\". Ainslie said, \"I didn't think it was proper.\" Despite the controversy, he elected in Ward 43. In April 2007, he determined that it costs $20,000 annually to provide councillors and staff at City Hall offices with free coffee every day. He moved a motion in committee to remove the expense, but it failed to pass. During the Rob Ford drug allegation scandal, Ainslie was removed as chair from the city's government management committee and appointed as chair of the parks and environment committee. On October 11, 2013 he resigned from the mayor's executive committee and his role as chair of the parks and environment committee over differences with Ford's longterm strategic direction for the city. On May 3, 2013, Ainslie was stopped by a RIDE check on Kingston Road and was given a three-day licence suspension."

  "text" : "Peter John Batchelor (born 21 September 1950) was an Australian politician before retiring at the Victorian State Election on 27 November 2010. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly since 1990, representing the electorate of Thomastown. He served most recently as Minister for Energy and Resources and Minister for Community Development. He was Minister for Transport from 1999 to 2006. Prior to entering politics he was the state secretary of the Australian Labor Party from 1983 to 1990. Before that he worked for a time at the Furnishing Trades Union. While state secretary of the Labor Party, Batchelor was involved in a scandal surrounding the 1985 Nunawading by-election. He was accused of distributing misleading how-to-vote cards which claimed to be a vote for \"nuclear disarmament\", leading voters to conclude they were voting for the Nuclear Disarmament Party.  Unilateral nuclear disarmament was a popular cause within the Left during the 1980s. Police investigated the matter and Batchelor was not charged with any criminal offence. The biggest project undertaken in transport while Batchelor was minister was the $750 million Regional Fast Rail project. In 2000 the State Government approved funding to upgrade rail lines to provide fast rail passenger services between Melbourne and Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and Traralgon. The Victorian Auditor General noted that in spite of money spent, the \"average journey time savings for all passengers using these services are likely to be more modest than implied by the government’s target journey times\". On 7 October 2010, Batchelor announced that he would not re-contest his seat at the 2010 state election and he retired at that election. In February, 2012, Peter Batchelor was appointed President of the Community Broadcasting Foundation. The Foundation, based in Melbourne, is the independent funding body for Australian community radio and television, distributing more than $15m of federal grant monies annually."

Jenkins, a hotelier, first ran for the territorial legislature in 1989 but lost to NDP cabinet minister Art Webster. In that vote, Jenkins' campaign manager was future Liberal Premier Pat Duncan. Prior to entering provincial politics, he served as mayor of Dawson City from 1980 to 1994, earning the nickname \"Pirate Pete\" after he registered for satellite television service under the name of a dead local pioneer and then redistributed the television signals to residents of Dawson City for free. Jenkins was first elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly in the 1996 election in Klondike for the Yukon Party. He defended his seat in the 2000 election, the only Yukon Party member to do so. He assumed the leadership of the party after the election. He held the position as sole MLA and leader until May and June 2002, when Dennis Fentie crossed the floor from the NDP and won the leadership party's leadership, defeating Jenkins and former party president Darcy Tkachuk on the first ballot. He defended his seat successfully in the 2002 general election and was sworn into cabinet in November, serving as Health Minister and Deputy Premier until November 28, 2005 when he resigned from the party and cabinet. Jenkins said this was because \"the heart and soul of my community has been ripped out by the inefficiences of government at the municipal level, the territorial level.\" Fentie told the press at the time it was due to the ongoing loans file, which involved Jenkins owing $300,000 to the territorial government he was a part of. This eventually was cleared off the books in March 2006. Jenkins sat as an Independent MLA in the Assembly until dissolution, and chose not to run in the 2006 general election. Jenkins later ran for another term as mayor of Dawson City in the 2009 municipal election, defeating incumbent John Steins by seven votes. He was defeated in the 2012 municipal election by Wayne Potoroka."

  "text" : "Philip Christian Koperberg AO AFSM BEM (born 28 April 1943), is the Chairman of the New South Wales Emergency Management Committee, responsible for advising the New South Wales government on emergency response strategies, since 2011. Koperberg is a former Australian politician, was the New South Wales Minister for Climate Change, Environment and Water between 2007 and 2008; and was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, representing the electorate of the Blue Mountains for the Australian Labor Party between 2007–2011. Prior to his political career, Koperberg was the Commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) in Australia between 1997–2007. \"An expert in risk and crisis management, Phil Koperberg was the overall emergency controller during the 2001 Christmas/New Year fires, when Australia faced its longest and most intense bush firefighting campaign. In 1994 Phil Koperberg was also the overall emergency controller, as firefighters battled to control over 800 New South Wales fires covering in excess of 800,000 hectares. In 1999, his expertise was again called upon during the severe hail storms which damaged more than 30,000 properties.\" In September 1997, Koperberg was appointed the RFS Commissioner when the Service was formed under the Rural Fires Act. Before this he had been Director-General of the New South Wales Bush Fire Service from May 1990. In March 2007 he was elected to State parliament and appointed to the Ministry. However, in December he was forced to stand aside due to a police investigation regarding domestic violence allegations from 1987. The NSW Director of Public Prosecutions declined to press charges and Koperberg was reinstated to the Ministry. He resigned from the Ministry on 22 February 2008. Koperberg did not recontest the 2011 state election."

During his tenure the size of the currency notes oF denomination 5, 10 and 100 were reduced in size for economic reasons.

She is a Hindi poet and social worker. Thakur was a member of 12th Lok Sabha from Ajmer constituency in Rajasthan from 1998 to 1999. In 2009, she was openly critical of the Left Front rule of the state of Bengal, saying that crimes against women have been growing in the previous 33 years of rule. In 2014, she was part of a group of women who supported an Aam Sabha for the 33% Women's Reservation Bill. She stated that the bill would help \"empower Indian women socially, economically and politically.\" Thakur has spoken out on other women's issues, calling for stricter anti-rape provisions in India. Thakur was also a supporter of laws against 'honour killings.' She has responded to comments about implementing dress codes to combat incidents of rape and has been quoted saying, \"The question is not about the dress code, but the mentality of men. What the girls should wear should be the concern of the girl, her parents and her family only. I don't think there is a need for anyone else to say anything about how a girl should behave.\" Thakur believes instead, that as more women see rapists being dealt \"justice,\" they will be more likely to file cases against assailants. She has previously spoken out about the amount of violent crime against women in Delhi."

He was in large part responsible for consolidating elements of the Cook County Democratic Party into a political machine. He evolved from a local sewage contractor to a political boss by carefully selecting his political allies. His prominence stems from the death of Anton Cermak and his political career is intertwined with that of Edward Joseph Kelly. The success of this machine was attributed to its decision to be more inclusive than its predecessors. This meant that Nash had success at dealing with a variety of politicians such as William L. Dawson."

Born in Carrigallen, County Leitrim, Galligan attended school at St. Patrick's in Cavan. As a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Irish Volunteers, during the Easter Rising Galligan cycled from Dublin to Wexford carrying James Connolly's battle orders to ensure that the volunteers in the area rose to support those in Dublin. When the volunteers disbanded he cycled back to Cavan but was arrested at the family home. He was elected unopposed as the Sinn Féin MP for Cavan West at the 1918 general election. The following month, in January 1919, Sinn Féin MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called Dáil Éireann, though Galligan did not attend as he was in prison. He was arrested again in September 1920  and re-elected as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cavan constituency at the 1921 elections. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted in favour of it. He did not contest the 1922 general election and retired from politics."

He graduated from St. Anthony Village High School and the University of Minnesota before attending the University of Minnesota Law School. He worked for several years as an attorney before seeking public office. He also served on the Metropolitan Council from 1983–1986. He won election to the House in 1986 from Brooklyn Center, representing District 47B, which included portions of Hennepin County. He also maintained a private practice and served as prosecutor for the city of Shorewood during this same time period. While in the House, Carruthers served as chair of the Metropolitan Affairs Subcommittee on Government Structure, the Local Government and Metropolitan Affairs Subcommittee on Metro Affairs, the Judiciary Subcommittee on Data Privacy, the Rules and Legislative Administration Committee, and the Rules and Legislative Administration Subcommittee on Administration. In 1993, Carruthers was chosen to be Majority Leader when Irv Anderson became Speaker. He served as majority leader during the next two legislative sessions and became chair of the Rules and Legislative Administration Committee. When Anderson stepped down from the House leadership in 1997, he succeeded him as Speaker. He remained in that position until 1999, when the DFL majority was defeated by the Republican Party, and Steve Sviggum succeeded him as Speaker. He served one more term in the House before retiring in 2001."

  "text" : "Paul T. Jordan (born c. 1941) is an American physician and Democratic Party politician who served as the 37th Mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey. He succeeded interim mayor Charles K. Krieger. Being 30 years old at the time of his election, Jordan is the youngest mayor in the history of Jersey City. After graduating from medical school in 1968, Jordan ran a drug rehabilitation center in Jersey City. His political involvement began when he joined a local reform group called the Community Action Council. Jordan was first elected as a reform candidate in a special election following the resignation of Thomas J. Whelan after Whelan's conviction for extortion and conspiracy. Jordan's election was hailed as an end to machine control of Jersey City politics, and was credited to support from a large number of young voters. He was re-elected to a full four-year term in 1973. Jordan was the first mayor to propose a major redevelopment of the Jersey City waterfront. During his term, Jordan appointed Shirley Tolentino as the first African-American woman to serve as a full-time municipal court judge in New Jersey. In 1977, Jordan simultaneously ran for reelection in Jersey City's non-partisan May election and for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New Jersey, with the primary held in June. Jordan used an aggressive television advertising campaign that was estimated to cost up to $200,000. After losing the mayoral election, he withdrew from the gubernatorial primary and supported incumbent Governor Brendan Byrne. Jordan's campaign later received a $30,000 campaign contribution from Byrne's campaign, allowing him to retire 25% of his campaign debt. Jordan retired from politics and returned to his medical career following his withdrawal from the primary. He later served as the Chairman of Emergency Medicine at Trinitas Hospital in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Jordan currently serves as a member of the New Jersey State Board of Human Services and served as its chairman from 1991 until 1996. He is also the treasurer of the State Board of Medical Examiners."

When a general election was called in January 1910, P W Raffan was selected as Liberal candidate for Leigh in south Lancashire. John Brunner, the sitting Liberal member of parliament, had chosen to stand in Northwich. The constituency contained a large number of coalminers, and Raffan was opposed not only by the Conservatives, but by Thomas Greenall of the Labour Party, who was a leader of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation. Leigh was one of the few seats where Labour and Liberals ran against each other. Raffan won the seat easily. In the Commons Raffan became secretary of the Land Values Group who sought reform in property taxation. He supported women's suffrage, disestablishment of the Church in Wales and the temperance movement. At the 1918 general election Raffan was re-elected at Leigh as a Liberal and received the \"coupon\" despite being an opponent of the Coalition Government. At the 1922 election he stood unsuccessfully for election as a Liberal at Ayr Burghs. At the succeeding 1923 general election he successfully contested Edinburgh North for the Liberals, unseating the Unionist MP, Patrick Johnstone Ford. He only held the seat for one year, with Ford regaining the seat in the 1924 general election."

He is the only person in the state's history to serve as both Chief Judge of the Minnesota Court of Appeals and Chief Justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. Popovich was born in Crosby, Minnesota in 1920. He earned degrees from the University of Minnesota and William Mitchell College of Law (then the St. Paul College of Law) in 1942 and 1947, respectively. He was in private practice in the Twin Cities from 1947 to 1983, while also serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1953 to 1963. Upon the creation of the state Court of Appeals in 1983, Governor Rudy Perpich appointed Popovich to be Chief Judge. Perpich elevated him to the Supreme Court in 1987, and named him Chief Justice in 1989. Popovich resigned as Chief Justice in late 1990, having reached mandatory retirement age. Following his retirement from the Supreme Court, Popovich joined the Minneapolis law firm of Briggs & Morgan. He died in early 1996 at the age of 75."

When the order came to hand him over, he was kept hidden by his fellow prisoners. He was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) for the Tipperary constituency at the 1923 general election. He did not take his seat in the Dáil due to Sinn Féin's abstentionist policy. He did not contest the June 1927 general election. He emigrated to the US where be became a businessman, still supporting Irish nationalist campaigns, he died in America on 21 January 1944. His family were heavily involved in Irish nationalism and the GAA, his father was a local GAA official. His uncle was the priest and GAA figure Canon Michael Kennedy Ryan, and his brother Martin Ryan served as a Fianna Fáil TD for Tipperary from 1933 to 1943.

  "text" : "Philip Roy (Phil) Gray (born 20 April 1947) is an Australian politician. He was a Labor member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 2006 to 2009. Born in Brisbane, Gray attended state schools before becoming a teacher, studying at the University of Queensland and the University of New England. A member of the Australian Labor Party, he was elected as the member for Gaven in the 2006 state election, defeating National Party member Alex Douglas, who had won the seat against Gray in a by-election earlier that year. In late 2008, Gray earned himself some bad publicity when he was accused of two separate instances of \"bullying\", both of them against elderly women. In the first instance he threaten to sue an outspoken constituent who, at a public meeting in November 2008, said she would not be voting for Gray. This was followed in December by a legal threat against a Labor member, from whom he demanded $10,000 and an apology, for criticising him in an internal party report. His behaviour was denounced by Premier Anna Bligh and Gray was forced to publicly apologise for his actions. The 2009 state election pitted Gray against Alex Douglas for the third consecutive time. On this occasion, Douglas, running under the banner of the newly formed Liberal National Party, narrowly emerged as the victor. Following his defeat, Gray angrily slammed what he perceived as negative and \"biased\" coverage of him by the Gold Coast Bulletin."

Prior to his employment with Hanafin he was employed in a number of NGO roles including as a Director of Support Services for the Special Olympics World Summer Games. O'Brien has been appointed by Hanafin to a number of organisations including the National Children’s Advisory Council, Dún Laoghaire Local Drugs Task Force and the Dún Laoghaire Young People’s Facilities and Services Fund. In November 2008, O'Brien was selected alongside sitting Fianna Fáil Councillor Cormac Devlin to seek election in the Dún Laoghaire Local Electoral Area. During the course of the election O’Brien became embroiled in a number of embarrassing controversies. In late April the Mail on Sunday ran a story claiming Hanafin improperly used Oireachtas envelopes, which are provided at taxpayer expense, to promote O’Brien’s campaign launch in a local Dalkey Hotel. On 17 May 2009 O'Brien became very publicly embroiled in a bitter dispute with a local pensioner over the placement of election posters he erected in his local area. Throughout the Local Election Campaign, O'Brien attracted the strong support of Minister Mary Hanafin, with one newspaper commenting Hanafin was trying to \"shaft\" the sitting Fianna Fáil County Councillor Cormac Devlin. On 26 May 2009, O'Brien became embroiled in further controversy when a national newspaper ran a story claiming Hanafin's office went as far as using tax payer funded resources to promote him in correspondence to voters in the Dún Laoghaire constituency. O'Brien secured 647 (3.6%) first preference votes on polling day and failed to get elected."

  "text" : "Pir Mazhar Ul Haq (Urdu:  پیر مظہر الحق ‎) is a politician in Pakistan who comes from the spiritual family of Bhan Syedabad and is a descendant of Makhdoom Moosa, 5th son of Hazrat Makhdoom Sarwar Nooh of Hala. Pir Mazhar who is considered one of the most loyal members of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has offered many sacrifices for the party. He has faced jail and exile as a result of the political victimization campaigns run by those governments who were brought in power (directly or indirectly) by the military dictators but he never compromised on principles. He joined the PPP when other activists had started jumping off the PPP ship after the imposition of Gen Zia's martial law in the late 1970s. During the PPP governments in 1988 and 1993, Pir Mazhar was inducted as minister for housing and town planning, and law and parliamentary affairs respectively. He is currently the Parliamentary leader of Pakistan Peoples Party in Sindh Assembly, a member of the Central Executive Committee of Pakistan Peoples Party and the Senior Minister in the Sindh Provincial Government, holding the portfolios of Education, Literacy and Criminal Prosecution Service. Pir Mazhar Ul Haq was first elected to the Sindh Assembly from PS-74 Dadu-IV in Dadu, Sindh, Pakistan in 1988 and has continued winning all the elections he has contested since then from this constituency. This is one of the most politically influential families of Sindh. His paternal grandfather was Pir Ilahi Bux who was nominated the Chief Minister of Sindh province by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Pir Sahib was always proud to have been nominated as the Chief Minister of Sindh by no less than the Quaid-e-Azam himself. He also remained minister for 10 years, holding the portfolio of Education. Pir Mazhar's maternal grandfather was Qazi Akbar who was one of the longest serving provincial minister in Sindh holding several portfolios including the Home department. His aunt (Qazi Akbar's niece) is Fahmida Mirza who served as the Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan. His uncle is Zulfiqar Mirza who is also Fahmida Mirza's husband served as the Home Minister of Sindh. His daughter Marvi Mazhar contested in the 2002 general elections from Dadu constituency and got elected as the first women member of parliament to be elected from Dadu District. His Son in Law is Jam Ikram Dharejo who got elected as a member of parliament (MPA) by defeating the Mahers of Ghotki (also one of the powerful political and tribal families of Sindh). His eldest son Pir Mujeeb is currently serving as member of parliament from the Dadu constituency. He is also the great nephew of Qazi Abdul Majeed Abid, who has held numerous Federal Ministries, including Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting, and Federal Minister for Water and Power. Pir Mazhar is an articulate lawyer and if he had not jumped into politics, he would have been among the top lawyers of the country. He is also considered as one of the closest aides to the Late Benazir bhutto and her husband (current President of Pakistan) Asif Ali Zardari. During his more than three decades of association with the PPP, he suffered incarceration in 15 prisons (including the dreaded Machh Jail), Torture, kidnapping, and exile but he steadfastly clung to the party and did not succumb to any pressure put on him to change his loyalties. His eldest son Barrister Pir Mujeeb Ul Haq is an office bearer of the Pakistan Peoples Party in Dadu District and has his own law practice with the name of P.I.B. Law Associates having chambers in Karachi, Hyderabad and Dadu. He is also an elected member of Parliament from the Dadu Constituency. His second son Pir Danish Ali is currently serving Pakistan Peoples Party as its President in Dadu city which has been the ancestral constituency of the Pir family since before the independence of Pakistan."

  "text" : "Percival Hillam Quirke (29 July 1898 – 25 March 1972) was an Australian politician. A farmer and soldier prior to entering politics, Quirke contested the normally safely conservative federal seat of Wakefield in a 1938 by-election as an independent. He finished a distant third on the primary vote, with 22.8 percent behind former Liberal and Country League Premier Richard Layton Butler and Labor challenger Sydney McHugh. However, on the second count, almost 83 percent of his preferences flowed to McHugh, enough for McHugh to decisively defeat Butler with 56 percent of the two-party vote. Quirke later won the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Stanley, serving from 1941 as a Labor member, before leaving Labor in 1948, representing the seat of Burra as an independent until 1963, then the LCL until he resigned from politics in 1968. Quirke and the other independent in the legislature, Tom Stott held the balance of power at the 1962 election. They both provided confidence and supply to the Playford Liberal and Country League (LCL) as a minority government in the hung parliament, allowing Playford to remain in power for what would be his final term. Stott became Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly following the election. In 1963 Quirke ceased being an independent, joined the LCL, and served in the Playford LCL ministry in the portfolios of Irrigation, Lands, and Repatriation until the LCL lost government at the 1965 election."

He was an active member of the Nova Scotia Teachers Union, serving as president of the Halifax Local. He also served as President of the Heritage Trust of Nova Scotia. Delefes attempted to enter provincial politics in 1997, but lost to Liberal Ed Kinley by 165 votes in a byelection for the Halifax Citadel riding. He ran again in 1998, and appeared to defeat Kinley by 125 votes on election night, however, there was some confusion over the calculation of poll results and the margin of victory was reduced to 40 when official results were announced. A judicial recount was held on April 14, and Delefes was officially declared elected by 37 votes. In the 1999 election, Delefes and Kinley ran against each other for the third time in 19 months, but Progressive Conservative Jane Purves won the seat, defeating Delefes by 434 votes. Delefes tried to regain the seat in the 2003 election, but both he and Purves were defeated by Liberal leader Danny Graham."

Born in Pence, Wisconsin, Alfonsi graduated from University of Wisconsin–Whitewater, and then taught school. Alfonsi served in the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1933-1939 and 1959–1969 and was speaker of the Assembly in 1937. Alfonsi ran, unsuccessfully, in an attempt to gain the Progressive Party nomination for governor in 1940, but was defeated by Orland Loomis. In 1942 he switched parties and ran, once again, unsuccessfully in the Republican primary against Alvin O'Konski. Following this defeat, he enlisted in the United States Army during World War Two. Upon being discharged, he returned to teaching and became the Principal of Minocqua High School. Alfonsi returned to the state assembly, this time as a Republican, in 1958, and went on to serve as the assembly majority and minority leader. In 1967, Alfonsi was convicted of bribery. However, the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the conviction. Then Alfonsi was retried, but was acquitted. Alfonsi died in Madison, Wisconsin on November 22, 1989."

  "text" : "Philip Henry (Pat) Morton (28 October 1910 – 18 January 1999) was an Australian businessman and politician. Born in Lismore in Northern New South Wales to a prominent political family and educated at Lismore High School, Morton left school at fourteen to be employed in a legal firm, before branching out into various businesses. Moving to Sydney, Morton first entered politics in 1944 as an Alderman on Mosman Municipal Council, rising to be Mayor in 1946. Morton then entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 3 May 1947, representing the Electoral district of Mosman for the Liberal Party of Australia. Morton soon rose through the party ranks, becoming touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested the leadership in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton then stood, but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take the leadership. Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected to succeed him as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition. Morton contested as Leader the 1956 and 1959 elections, gaining seats each time but failing to defeat the long-standing Labor Government. A few months after the 1959 election, Morton was deposed as Leader by now-Deputy Leader Askin in July 1959. He remained on the backbenches until Askin led the Liberal Party to its first electoral victory in May 1965, whereupon Morton was appointed as the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Highways. He served in the cabinet, becoming prominent and controversial in his role in the reorganisation of the City of Sydney as Local Government Minister and state planning regulations, until he retired from parliament in June 1972. He died in Mosman aged 88 in 1999."

  "text" : "Peter Fenton (May 12, 1886 – October 5, 1953) was a Canadian politician, who served as mayor of Sudbury, Ontario from 1930 to 1932. He was the 17th mayor of Sudbury since its incorporation in 1893, and the first mayor of Sudbury after it was granted city status in 1930. On November 27, 1929 he was acclaimed mayor of the city due to the lack of candidates running for office in the 1929 election. In 1930 he stood again for mayor. During the election campaign he promised to build a new town hall and a subway under the Elm Street rail line, along with improving the local utilities in conjunction with municipal services. His campaign slogan was \"Sudbury is a progressive city; we should be optimists and boasters, not pessimists and knockers\". Fenton was widely regarded as a populist mayor and a worthy political opponent. On December 1, 1930, he won the election with 1,373 votes, the largest win in a municipal election in Sudbury at that time. He was successful at incorporating the city and building the Sudbury Jail, and did the best he could to enable the City of Sudbury to provide relief to citizens affected by the Great Depression. He converted the former jail into a flop house, and was able to provide relief to 4,142 recipients in December 1930. However, in an effort to encourage the recipients to \"find work\", meals were gradually cut back from three meals to one meal per day by March 1931. Despite his attempts at advocating for the impoverished citizens of Sudbury, his spending and confrontational style eventually thrust him out of office amid some controversy. Known for unilaterally making decisions on council and running a deficit, he was defeated in 1932 by W. Marr Brodie. Brodie was successful at demanding stricter practices in administering the city's welfare programs, the issue which cost Fenton the election. The ballots cast were 3,138 to 1,591, a clear margin of victory for Brodie."

Galloway is a member of a number of medical committees, and was the past Chairperson of the Marathon Republican Party. She was elected to the Wisconsin Senate in 2010. She had been facing an effort to recall her from office. However, on March 16, 2012, Galloway announced her resignation from office due to health issues in her family, leaving the Senate evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Galloway's seat was filled in the recall election, which had already been scheduled. She was succeeded by fellow Republican Jerry Petrowski. Galloway relocated to Warsaw, Indiana where she announced in May 2015 that she would make a bid for the United States House of Representatives and run for Marlin Stutzman's seat in Indiana's 3rd congressional district. As of July 2015 she raised $51,423 in campaign contributions, with $50,000 coming from loans she made to herself."

  "text" : "Patrick Michael Callaghan (1927 – January 5, 2009) was a politician in New Brunswick, Canada who was briefly leader of the New Democratic Party of New Brunswick. Callaghan was born in Scotland and raised in Dunbarton and the Red Clydeside area of Scotland which was known for its radicalism. As a youth he joined the Scottish National Party followed by the Labour Party. In 1954, he emigrated to Halifax, Nova Scotia and then moved to New Brunswick where he settled in Fredericton, established a window cleaning business, and joined the province's Co-operative Commonwealth Federation which became the New Democratic Party in 1962. He was a candidate for the federal NDP in 1965 and 1968. In 1970, he was approached by a group of young radical socialists active at the University of New Brunswick and established a riding association in York—Sunbury with himself as president. The group soon became involved with the Ontario-based Waffle movement, a left wing socialist faction within the NDP and helped found the New Brunswick chapter of the Waffle in late 1970. The Waffle became a dominant force in the New Brunswick NDP in 1971 and Callaghan announced his intention to seek the party's leadership. Due to conflicts between Wafflers and anti-Wafflers over the legitimacy of the party's fall convention at which the New Brunswick Waffle manifesto had been approved, the party split into two, on October 16, 1971, with one faction led by Callaghan and a second, non-Waffle faction led by J. Albert Richardson with both men claiming to be NDP leader. The federal NDP intervened on November 12, 1971 by suspending the New Brunswick NDP and calling a special convention for November 21 to resolve the dispute. The Wafflers were demoralized by this and Callaghan spoke of leaving the NDP and reviving the CCF. Callaghan and many other Wafflers did not attend the special convention which saw the re-election of J. Albert Richardson as party leader. The Waffle declined and was inactive by the end of the year."

  "text" : "Peter Dawson (April 11, 1892 – March 24, 1963) was a Canadian minister, politician and member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Dawson was born in 1892 in Scotland. After attending schools and briefly working as a labourer and an apprentice to a butcher in Maybole, Dawson immigrated to Canada at the age of 18 with his brother, James Dawson. Shortly after arriving, he took up residence in Ontario where he worked in the automobile profession for 7 years until moving west to Alberta in 1918. Following his decision to settle in Calgary, he found employment as a butcher and interest in missionary work. His residence in Calgary, however, didn't last long, as 5 years later, he moved to the nearby capital city of Edmonton, where he attended Prebysterian schooling. Ordained as a minister of the United Church in 1927, he soon was called in 1928 to Sedgewick, where he remained for two years, before getting called to Champion. Although not intending to have a career in politics, a group of citizens persuaded him to run in the 1935 election, in which he defeated United Farmers Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Oran McPherson by 66% of the vote. In 1937, Dawson was appointed Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. During his 26-year tenure, from 1937 until his death in 1963, he witnessed and presided over many events, such as the first instance of crossing the floor in Alberta and naming a fellow MLA for remarks made at a provincial official. He also witnessed 2 royal visits to Alberta from two different monarchs, King George IV in 1939, and Queen Elizabeth II 20 years later, in which he presided over the installation of a fountain in the Legislature's rotunda. After dying in office in 1963, Dawson was honoured with a state funeral, attended by many prominent citizens of Alberta."

The official return for the 1931 election lists him as Pepene Tango Eketone; the middle name is not mentioned in his Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Eketone was politically active and contested his first general election in 1887, when he stood in the Western Maori electorate; he came third out of five candidates. In the 1890 election, he came second after the incumbent, Hoani Taipua. In the 1896 election, he was one of 13 candidates in the Western Maori electorate and came seventh. He had one last (unsuccessful) attempt of getting elected in the Western Maori electorate in the 1931 general election; of the six candidates, he came fourth."

  "text" : "Pavlo Mykolayovych Kyshkar (Ukrainian: Павло Миколайович Кишкар, born 22 September 1980) is a Ukrainian politician. He worked as a financial controller at a tourist company in Thailand until 2014, when he returned to Ukraine and became an information coordinator for the Donbass Battalion. Appearing seventh on the party list of Self Reliance, he was elected to the Verkhovna Rada in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election. Kyshkar was expelled from Self Reliance on 31 August 2015 for his support of amendments to the Ukrainian Constitution that would lead to decentralization and greater powers for areas held by pro-Russian separatists. On 31 March 2016 he joined the Petro Poroshenko Bloc parliamentary faction."
