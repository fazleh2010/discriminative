Thereafter, Molloy sat out the remainder of her term as an independent before being defeated at the 2006 state election.

I Should Know.\" In it, he sought to debunk right-wing commentators who claimed that President Barack Obama was a secret socialist. Wharton wrote: \"The funny thing is, of course, that socialists know that Barack Obama is not one of us. Not only is he not a socialist, he may in fact not even be a liberal. Socialists understand him more as a hedge-fund Democrat.\" The article led to increased media attention that resulted in multiple appearances on Fox Business News and a series of radio interviews including a segment on the CBC. Since then, Wharton's articles have consistently been published in on-line left-wing publications such as \"Counterpunch,\" the \"MRZine,\" \"Dissident Voice,\" \"In These Times,\" \"Counter Currents\" and \"The Indypendent.\""

He was born on a farm in Hebron, Nebraska, the son of Frank Herman Kemper and Louisa Haulker. In 1906, Kemper found work with a survey crew working on the railway west of Edmonton, Alberta. He returned home later that year but, in the summer of 1907, he traveled north again and worked on a farm near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. Later in 1907, he settled on a homestead south of Gull Lake. Kemper returned to Nebraska and married Mina Burwell in 1911. The couple returned to Saskatchewan later that same year. After working on a farm near Moose Jaw, they were able to purchase land not far from his original homestead. Kemper served on the rural municipal district council for Arlington. He was also a director for the Saskatchewan section of the United Farmers of Canada. Kemper was elected during the Saskatchewan general election, 1934, representing Gull Lake as a member of the Farmer-Labour Group (FLG). The FLG was founded in 1932. In 1935, it changed its name and officially became the Saskatchewan section of the national Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF. During the eighth provincial election on June 19, 1934, the FLG had five elected members come to office, including Kemper. He was defeated when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in Gull Lake in 1938 and in the Maple Creek federal riding in 1940. In 1953, Kemper sold his farm and retired to the town of Shaunavon. He died in a car accident near Tompkins while travelling to a CCF rally."

  "text" : "(For those of a similar name, see Susan Davis (disambiguation).) Susan Margaret Davies (born 14 March 1954) is a former Australian politician. She was born in Mirboo North, Victoria, to parents Richard Llewellyn (dec) and Jean Margaret Davies (dec). She attended Leongatha High School (1966–70) and Watsonia High School in 1971, when she completed her Higher School Certificate. She received a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education in 1976 from Latrobe University. She subsequently became a secondary school teacher, and began farming in addition to this in 1989. Davies joined the Australian Labor Party in 1993, as part of the rural protest against Kennett government funding and service cuts, and was the Labor candidate for Gippsland West in the 1996 Victorian state election. Sitting Liberal MP Alan Brown resigned less than a year after the state election, precipitating a by-election. Labor declined to stand a candidate for this very safe Liberal seat; it and its predecessors had been in the hands of a conservative party for more than a century and a half. Davies resigned from the Labor Party and contested the by-election as an independent, emerging victorious. She retained her seat in the 1999 state election, and held the balance of power with two other rural Independents when a significant, mostly rural, and very anti-Kennett-government swing led to a hung parliament. Davies played a key role in developing the \"Independents' Charter\", which the three independents used as a basis for backing Steve Bracks and the Labor Party as the new minority government. She served on the Public Accounts and Estimates committee during the following parliamentary term. Prior to the 2002 election, Gippsland West was essentially replaced by the newly created seat of Bass, which was notionally Liberal in a traditional matchup. Davies contested Bass, but lost to the Liberal candidate, former MLC Ken Smith. She later rejoined the Labor Party and contested the 2004 federal election as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of La Trobe. She was defeated by the Liberal candidate, Jason Wood. Davies now runs a small farm in South Gippsland, is part of a local food producers' network and Korumburra Landcare, and is a director on several organisations, including Chairing Energy Innovation Co-operative Ltd, which promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency measures as a response to climate change and peak oil."

He was the national chairman of the Reform Party, and a frequent candidate on their ticket. He has since become a member of the Democratic Party. He is probably best known for his frequently running for mayor of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He has sought the office in 2005 and 2009. O'Hara first ran for Governor of Mississippi in 1991 as the Reform Party candidate. He received 11,253 votes, or 1.58%. He ran as the Reform Party candidate for the United States Senate in Mississippi in 2000. He received 7,315 votes, or 0.74% of the vote. In 2002 he ran for the U.S. Senate again and was the lone challenger to Thad Cochran. He received 97,226 votes, or 15.42%. While a member of the Reform Party, O'Hara supported the candidacy of George W. Bush. After his party nominated Ralph Nader as presidential candidate in 2004, O'Hara said he hoped Nader could spoil the election: \"I’m doing everything I can to make sure John Kerry never gets around the White House.\"This sentiment, and the fact that O'Hara was a supporter of the Ku Klux Klan's Samuel Bowers, and his statements that he had once favored the execution of abortion doctors, put O'Hara odds with other Reform Party members. In 2003 he was the Reform Party candidate for Governor of Mississippi and received 4,070 votes for 0.46% of the vote. In 2007 O'Hara ran as a Democrat for state treasurer and received 284,789 votes (39.47%). O'Hara sought the Democratic Party nomination for the United States Senate in 2008, however, he was defeated in the primary by Erik R. Fleming 65.8% - 34.2%. O'Hara ran for the seat in Mississippi's 3rd congressional district as a Democrat. Much to the chagrin of Reform Party members, O'Hara returned to their party in 2011. He announced he would run for governor on their ticket, and also filed to run for state treasurer as both a Democrat and a Reform Party candidate. He received 26,290 votes, or 3.01%, in the race for state treasurer. In Mississippi's 2012 election for U.S. Senate, O'Hara ran as the Reform Party candidate and received 13,194 votes, or 1.06%. He ran for Governor of Mississippi in the 2015 election, finishing last with less than 2% of the vote."

He was born on 7 February 1853 at Beadnell, Northumberland, England and after training to become a blacksmith moved to Queensland in 1877. He became a mining speculator on the Croydon goldfields and then set up his own forge in Tambo, Queensland to service mining operations in the local region. He became involved in local politics for the Australian Labor Party, and in 1893 he was elected to represent the electoral district of Barcoo in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and served in that post until 1909. He rose to senior positions within the party, culminating in his election as leader of the Queensland Parliamentary Labor Party in 1904 after the death of his predecessor William Henry Brown. Kerr's leadership was complicated by a split in the party in 1905 in which he and other senior Labor figures opted to form a coalition with the Liberal Party to achieve statewide reforms. Although initially he commanded the confidence of the party, a state conference of the party in 1907 rejected Kerr's leadership and the Liberal-Labor coalition, opting to go into the 1907 state election alone. Kerr continued in parliament as an independent Labor member but was challenged by official Labor candidates until his defeat in his seat in 1909. He died on 18 January 1930 in Brisbane and was buried in Toowong Cemetery."

He was the nominee for the Republican and Conservative parties ultimately losing to incumbent Borough President Helen Marshall. Sica's earliest education was at St. Stephen's Elementary School. Sica graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School. He then went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts from Pace University (Government and Business), a B.A. from Atlantic Union College (Religion), attended New York Law School, and did religious graduate work with Andrews University. Sica served New York City in various capacities. He worked in the New York City Department of Hospitals, which is now called the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. He was a senior investigator for the New York City Department of Finance, a NYC Housing Authority Assistant, a detective-investigator for the Queens County District Attorney's Office, and Marshal for the City (mayoral appointment). In 1980, Sica's career changed when he became a minister of various Seventh-day Adventist Churches in the city. Prior to running for borough president, Sica ran for the State Assembly's 24th district in 2000, and lost to Mark Weprin (72% to 28%). Sica then went on to run for Council District 23 in 2001 and lost to David Weprin (Mark's brother) 69% to 31%. During his run for the Council District, Sica outlined his wishes to promote a reduction in crime, the lowering of taxes, and reform of the city's education system through increased investment by the state. In the race for the State Assembly, Sica received the support of the Republican Party, the Conservative Party, and the Right to Life. In his 2001 bid for the City Council, he was additionally endorsed by the Independence Party. Sica was unopposed for the Republican and Conservative parties' nomination in the race for Queens Borough President. Additionally, Borough President Helen Marshall ran unopposed for the nomination of the Democratic and Working Families parties. After counting the absentee ballots and affidavit ballots cast either for Marshall or Sica, the result turned out to be seventy-five percent for Marshall and twenty-five percent for Sica. Sica's strongest assembly district was A.D. 23 (comprising Howard Beach, Ozone Park, and Far Rockaway) where he garnered 39% of the votes cast. Sica is married to Naomi (Jungling) Sica, Ed.D. Sica has four adult children and four grandchildren. Sica is active in the American Legion, having served in the Army's Military Police. On September 18, 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to continue representing the Republicans of the 24th Assembly District in the New York Republican State Committee. In October 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to be a Vice-Chairman of the Queens County Republican Party and is again serving as its Chaplain."

Together with other Danish communists, Larsen had to go into hiding in 1941 when the Danish police began arresting all party members. After the liberation of the Second World War Larsen became a minister in the interim government, and subsequently led his party to its best-ever result in the October 1945 election, in which it took 10% of the vote. The election however, resulted in a Liberal government, and Larsen's party was mostly shunned by the other party leaders. Following the rising in Hungary in 1956, Larsen condemned the Soviet Union's action. This led him into conflict with the members of the party leadership who had a greater loyalty to Moscow; a conflict that ended with his expulsion in November 1958. Larsen's reaction was to establish the Socialist People's Party (Socialistisk Folkeparti), which, thanks to Larsen's personal popularity, entered parliament at the 1960 election at the expense of the Communists, who from then on played only a very peripheral role in Danish politics. Aksel Larsen -- who was especially in later years highly respected among politicians, even if his party was seen as somewhat irresponsible -- remained as leader of the Socialists until 1968, when he handed over to Sigurd Ømann. He remained an MP until his death in 1972. In 2005, the Danish Institute for International Studies concluded that Larsen held a secret working relationship between 1958 and 1964 with one of Denmark's allied partners in the Cold War, stating that \"Larsen... obviously was an agent of a Western intelligence service.\""

  "text" : "Alison Nampitjinpa Anderson (born 1958) is an Australian politician. She was member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 2005 to 2016, representing the electorate of Namatijra (known as MacDonnell until 2012). Currently an independent, she has previously served as a minister for both the Australian Labor Party and Country Liberal Party and been territory leader of the Palmer United Party. Anderson entered the Northern Territory Assembly as a star candidate for the Australian Labor Party at the 2005 election. She was re-elected unopposed as the Member for MacDonnell in the August 2008 Territory election and with the subsequent return of the Henderson Labor Government was appointed to Cabinet. She held the positions of Minister for Natural Resources, Environment and Heritage; Minister for Parks and Wildlife; Minister for Arts and Museums; and Minister for Indigenous Policy. She left the Cabinet and the Labor Party in 2009 after a dispute over indigenous housing, and sat as an independent for two years. She then joined the opposition Country Liberal Party in 2011 and was elected as a Country Liberal candidate at the 2012 election. She resigned from the CLP in 2014, along with two other indigenous MPs, briefly becoming an independent once again. However, on 27 April 2014 it was announced that the three MLAs had joined the Palmer United Party, with Anderson serving as parliamentary leader. She resigned from Palmer United to sit as an independent on 29 November 2014. It was briefly rumoured that she was returning to the CLP amid the 2015 CLP leadership spill, but she remained an independent. Anderson speaks six indigenous languages: Anmatyerre, Luritja, Pitjantjatjara, Warlpiri, Western Arrernte and Yankunytjatjara. She is also an accomplished artist. She is among Australia's most senior indigenous politicians, and has been a prominent indigenous activist, including as an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Central Zone Commissioner (see: List of Indigenous Australian politicians). Her partner is Nicolas Rothwell, journalist with The Australian. Anderson retired at the 2016 Territory election."
