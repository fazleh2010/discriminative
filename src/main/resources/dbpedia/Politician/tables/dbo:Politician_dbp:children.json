Senate District 18 was greatly altered in the redistricting after the 2010 census and Roberts' home county of Robertson was moved to Senate District 25, requiring Roberts to wait until 2014 to run for re-election to the Tennessee Senate. He was succeeded by another Republican, Ferrell Haile, in November 2012. Roberts won the August 7, 2014 Republican Primary with 42 percent of the vote in a four-way primary, and then defeated Democratic Party nominee Tony Gross in the November 4, 2014, General Election with 70 percent of the vote. Tennessee State Senators are elected to four-year terms."

On May 1, 2014, Kelly took over the remainder of Ford's duties when Ford entered drug rehabilitation and started a leave of absence from Toronto City Council. These powers were returned when Ford returned to his job on July 1.

  "text" : "John Nicholas Udall usually called Nick Udall (July 23, 1913 – June 15, 2005) was mayor of Phoenix, Arizona from 1948–52. He was a member of the Udall political family and was also a nephew of Spencer W. Kimball, the 12th President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Udall was born and raised in Arizona. His parents John Hunt Udall and Ruth Kimball were in the same English literature class at the St. Joseph Stake Academy (now Eastern Arizona College), and when learning about playwright Nicholas Udall, they joked that if they ever got married, that they would name their son Nick, which they did. Udall attended Brigham Young University and the University of Arizona before enrolling in The George Washington University Law School, graduating in 1943. After graduation, he returned home to Arizona, where he began his law practice. He followed in his father's footsteps, and served as mayor of Phoenix from 1948 to 1952. He served with then-City Councilman Barry Goldwater. From 1952 to 1956 he served as judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court.

In about 1854, Hyeronimus built the homestead The Meeting of the Waters (now named Glenrock), on land west of the Bell River near Wellington. By 1859, he was the proprietor of Goonoo (now Goonoo Goonoo), a pastoral run of 30,000 acres (120 km2) in Wellington County, and also three other pastoral runs totalling 61,480 acres (248.8 km2) in Bligh County. On 15 June 1859, Hyeronimus was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the inaugural member for the electoral district of Wellington. However, he died in Sydney in 1860, after serving only just over one year in office."

Elected in November 1970, she first took office in January 1971, holding one of five seats (Position 1) in House District 13 (mostly in Lane County). With the implementation in 1972 of a reapportionment plan that replaced all existing Oregon House districts with new single-member districts, Fadeley represented new District 42 starting with the 1973 legislative session. In 1971 and 1973, she chaired the House Environment and Land Use Committee. During her tenure as the chair, the committee oversaw the passage of Senate Bill 100, Oregon’s pioneering, statewide land-use planning legislation, as well as the Oregon Bottle Bill. The passage of SB 100 prompted the formation of 1000 Friends of Oregon, a watchdog organization committed to the defense of, and advocacy for, the state's land-use program. Later she became a charter member and a national board member of the Older Women's League (OWL), a grassroots organization that advocates for women as they age. After her service in the Oregon Legislative Assembly, Fadeley began a career at the University of Oregon, where she was assistant vice provost. Fadeley was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She was married to Edward Fadeley for about 30 years, ending in 1984. During the 1970s, the couple both served in theOregon Legislature — Nancie in the House and Ed in the Senate. The mother of two children, Fadeley is now a freelance journalist who writes about Oregon history, environmental issues, and concerns of older women."

  "text" : "John Patrick Ducker AO (29 March 1932 - 25 November 2005), Australian labour leader and politician, played a leading role in the Australian labour movement and the Australian Labor Party for 20 years. Ducker was born in Kingston upon Hull, in northern England, the son of a bus driver, and worked on the docks from the age of 14. He migrated to Australia with his family in 1950, and became an ironworker and active in the Federated Ironworkers Association, at that time controlled by the Communist Party of Australia. Ducker, a convert to Catholicism, was a strong anti-Communist and became a supporter of B.A. Santamaria's Industrial Groups, which campaigned successfully to overturn the Communist control of the union. From 1952 Ducker was an official of the union under the new anti-Communist leader, Laurie Short (a non-Catholic). When the Labor Party split in 1955 over the related issues of Communism and the role of Santamaria's \"Movement\" within the party, Ducker did not follow many other Catholic anti-Communists into the Democratic Labor Party, but remained in the Labor Party, becoming a leading figure in the party's right wing. His characteristic North English accent led to him becoming known as \"Broovver Dooker\" throughout the movement. In 1961 Ducker moved from the Ironworkers to the Labor Council of New South Wales, becoming first an organiser and in 1975 becoming Secretary. In 1972 he was appointed a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. He was also President of the New South Wales Labor Party and vice-president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. In these positions he supported successive New South Wales Labor leaders such as Pat Hills, Neville Wran and Barrie Unsworth (also a Catholic convert). In 1973 he was the main organiser of the leadership coup which replaced Hills as leader with Wran, who went on to become Premier of New South Wales for ten years. Ducker was also a powerful supporter of Federal Labor Leader Gough Whitlam in his battles with the left wing of the Labor Party during the 1960s. In 1970 Ducker was a leading figure in the internal crisis in the Labor Party that cemented Whitlam's leadership. Convinced of the need to remove the left-wing controllers of the Victorian branch of the party if Labor was to win the 1972 federal election, Ducker did a deal with the left-wing leader Clyde Cameron, under which the right shared power with the left in the New South Wales branch in exchange for Cameron's support for the reform of the Victorian branch. He had a long association with Mater Maria Catholic College In 1979 Ducker's health declined and he resigned all his official positions, but Wran appointed him Chairman of the New South Wales Public Service Board. He remained a powerful influence behind the scenes, supporting younger Labor leaders such as Graham Richardson, Bob Carr and Paul Keating. He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1979, and the Catholic Church awarded him a Papal knighthood. He was also appointed to several company boards, including Qantas and the poker machine giant Aristocrat Leisure Industries."

In October 2003 he was elected borough mayor, defeating the incumbent, fellow Republican Rhonda Boyles. Whitaker was reelected in 2006 with over 77% of the vote. As mayor, Whitaker was known for supporting spending on quality of life services such as parks and recreation, as well as spearheading a campaign to prevent a drastic reduction in the operations of Eielson Air Force Base due to federal budget cuts. Whitaker endorsed Democrat Barack Obama in the 2008 United States presidential election and spoke during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Many member of the state GOP expressed ill feelings about the decision, with one former state senator accusing him of being a Republican In Name Only. Whitaker's endorsement of Obama was notable as the mayor of the second-largest metropolitan area in Alaska, the home state of 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who was nominated by John McCain after the Democratic convention. In 2009, Whitaker endorsed Democrat Luke Hopkins to be his successor as mayor. Hopkins won the election in a runoff on November 3 and succeeded Whitaker on November 16, 2009. In 2014, Whitaker was selected to be Governor Bill Walker's Chief of Staff."

He went on to gain substantial experience in banking, and was elected to the North Palm Beach Village Council in 1993. Later, he served as chairman, president, and CEO of the Barnett Bank of Broward County and the Treasure Coast, and later as market president of Riverside National Bank for Palm Beach and Broward counties. In 2000, Atwater ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 83rd District, defeating Democratic nominee Pam Dunston and independent Michael I. Danchuk. After just two years in the House, he ran for the Florida Senate from the 25th District, which included Palm Beach and Broward counties. Unopposed in the primary election, Atwater faced off against long-serving Democratic Attorney General of Florida Bob Butterworth in the general election, and, aided by then-Governor Jeb Bush's strong performance that year, defeated Butterworth by a solid margin. He was re-elected in 2004 with no opposition, and again in 2008, when he defeated Democrat Linda Bird, a realtor. From 2008 to 2010, he was the president of the Florida Senate. Following the decision by then-Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink to run for governor rather than seek re-election, Atwater jumped into the race to succeed Sink. In the general election, Atwater faced off against former State Representative Loranne Ausley, whom he defeated, 57.3 to 38.9. Though considered as a frontrunner, in April 2015, he declined to run for the US Senate seat Marco Rubio is expected to vacate before the Senate elections, 2016 to run for the US Presidency. Atwater has since changed his mind, stating that he may run in the upcoming 2016 Senate election."

He established the Junction's first weekly newspaper, the York Tribune and served as its editor for two years. He also served as chairman of the high school board for Toronto Junction, and in this capacity was instrumental in the town acquiring its first high school which later became Humberside Collegiate Institute. Following his stint in politics, Gilmour became active in prison reform, being named warden for the Central Prison at Toronto in 1896, a position he left to become Warden of the Ontario Reformatory at Guelph. At the time of his death he was the Ontario Parole Commissioner, and had the distinction of being the only Canadian prison official ever to serve as president of the American Prison Association (as Canada did not yet have its own prison association)."

He saw service in the eastern theater, and is best remembered for raising the first Union flag over the Confederate capitol of Richmond, Virginia, after its fall in 1865. After the war, de Peyster served overseas as a dignitary. When he returned to the United States, he ran for office and was elected to the State Assembly. His father disagreed with many of his political positions, and they eventually stopped speaking to each other. In 1900, the family feud culminated in a race for the office of Mayor of their native town, father running against son. After defeating his father, who owned the town hall, he was forced to move the Mayor's office to a new building. He died in 1903, survived by his three daughters."

  "text" : "John Hottinger is a Minnesota attorney and politician and a former member and majority leader of the Minnesota Senate. First elected in 1990, he was re-elected in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2002. A Democrat, he represented the old District 24 prior to the 2002 redistricting, and the current District 23 thereafter. The district included portions of Blue Earth, Le Sueur, Nicollet, Sibley and Waseca counties in the south central part of the state. Hottinger served as a majority whip from 1993 to 2000, and as an assistant majority leader during the 2001–02 biennium. He was chosen majority leader in 2003 after Senator Roger Moe retired to run for governor. After a difficult year, in which the DFL Party majority was seen to have been outmaneuvered by Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty, Hottinger stepped down, turning power over to Senator Dean Johnson. In January 2004, he was selected the national legislator of the month by the Center for Policy Alternatives one month after Illinois legislator Barack Obama won the honor Hottinger has been quoted as saying the two of them have since taken “divergent” paths. The CPA praised Hottinger “…for disowning budget cuts and yet giving the GOP enough votes on the budget bills so that government would not be shut down, which would have imposed further pain on vulnerable Minnesotans and state employees.” The CPA added that he had \"strengthened the progressive community for battles in 2004 and beyond.\" During his time in the Senate, Hottinger chaired the following committees: Health and Family Security, Rules, and Early Childhood Policy and Finance division of the Finance Committee. He also chaired the Legislative Committee to Review Administrative Rules and Senate Subcommittees on Insurance, Consumer Protection, Rulemaking, and Higher Education, Senate Budget, Personnel, Ethical Conduct, Permanent and Joint Rules, Intergovernmental Relations and Property Taxes. Hottinger was active in the [Council of State Governments] (CSG) and chaired the [Midwestern Legislative Conference] in 2001. He became the national chair of CSG in 2004 in leadership partnership with Governor [Frank Murkowski] of Alaska who served as CSG President. He was the first Minnesota legislator or Governor to serve as the national leader of the organization other than Governor Harold Stassen who was National President in 1941-42. Hottinger chose not to run for re-election in 2006. In 2007, he faced disciplinary action for misusing funds from a settlement that he had won for a client in his work as an attorney. In 2007, he faced disciplinary action for misusing funds from a settlement that he had won for a client in his work as an attorney.[3] He was suspended for a minimum of 18 months, petitioned to lift the suspension on June 17, 2010 and the Minnesota Supreme Court returned him to practice on January 12, 2011 finding him “prepared and morally qualified” to practice law. The Supreme Court decision  followed a hearing before the Minnesota Board of Lawyer's Professional Responsibility Board on November 18. 2010 and its unanimous decision to recommend reinstatement. There were no witnesses in opposition to the reinstatement and Hottinger’s eleven character witness included local attorneys and colleagues from the political world including DFL Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, former DFL Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, former Republican U.S. Senator David Durenberger and former Republican Party Chair Charles “Chuck” Slocum. After leaving the Senate, Hottinger worked for about four years as the chief consultant for some non-profit organizations funded by Minnesota-Washington philanthropist Ned Crosby: the Jefferson Center for New Democratic Process and Promoting Health Democracy in Minnesota and, on a limited basis, Health Democracy Oregon in Portland, Oregon. That work focused on Crosby’s Citizen Jury process for promoting citizen engagement through deliberative democracy. Hottinger was the Project Director for the Citizen Jury on Election Recounts concentrating on the process used in Minnesota in the recount of the U.S. Senate race between Al Franken and Norm Coleman in 2009. Hottinger was also a leader as the initial Vice President for Legal and Government Affairs for “The Minnesota World’s Fair”, the organization which launched the effort to bring the World’s Fair to Minnesota in 2022 or 2023. Hottinger has been active in non-profits including serving on the Executive Committee and as Chair of the Northstar (Minnesota) Chapter of the Sierra Club, a member of the Board and Executive Committee of the Northeast Midwest Institute in Washington, D.C. and as a member of the Board of the Somali Justice Center in Minneapolis. Hottinger currently lives and practices law and consulting on government, non-profits and the environment with Hottinger Consulting LLC in St. Paul, Minnesota."

In the early 1930s, he was one of the few prominent and respectable Calgarians to support William Aberhart's Social Credit League. He ran as a candidate for it in the 1935 provincial election and, when it won, was named Attorney General by Aberhart. Hugill's time as Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) was dominated by differences of opinion with Aberhart. Hugill did not believe that social credit could be legally implemented by a provincial government and did not support the government's attempts to do so. When asked by Lieutenant Governor John Campbell Bowen whether he considered three of the government's acts to be constitutional, he replied honestly that he did not; this prompted Aberhart to request his resignation. Thereafter Hugill was an outspoken opponent of the Aberhart government, though he did not seek re-election in the 1940 election. He retired from the practice of law in 1949, and died in 1971."

On September 22, 1813, he married Margaret Wintermute of Fort Erie, Ontario. He was among the many of Buffalo 's early pioneers who suffered from the economic collapse of 1836–1837, and from the speculation of Benjamin Rathbun. In 1816, he was elected as the first Treasurer of the Village of Buffalo, then elected Supervisor of Buffalo in 1823, 1825, and 1827. He was elected mayor by the Common council and accepted the office of Mayor on March 14, 1837. During his term, several new positions with the city were created, including superintendent of schools and the office of police justice. Also during his short term, the Canadian revolutionary movement, or \"Patriot War\" resulted in so much unrest in the city that it was becoming difficult to keep order. On June 17, 1837 he took a leave of absence and resigned as mayor on December 21, 1837. The council appointed Alderman Pierre A. Barker as mayor pro tem. Trowbridge resumed his medical practice and was actively engaged in his profession for 50 years.

Several years later, he moved to Buffalo and established his commission and malting businesses there. Manning was elected mayor in a special election held on January 9, 1883, as the Democratic candidate. He continued the string of vetoes begun by Mayor Grover Cleveland; they saved the city a great financial loss. Manning retired from politics after losing his campaign for re-election. He continued to grow and expand the malting business and built several grain elevators in the 1890s, each with a large storage capacity. On May 30, 1902, the largest fire Black Rock had ever seen consumed Manning's Frontier Canada plant. He died on April 28, 1908 at Brooklyn, New York and is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery."

He was known as Johnny De Pow by his constituents. Along with Bathhouse John Coughlin and Hinky Dink Kenna, Powers was considered one of the leaders of the \"Gray Wolves\" of Chicago politics. Powers arrived in Chicago in 1872 and began working as an apprentice to a grocer. After opening his own grocery store, he added a tavern next to it and used his exposure there to begin a political career as a ward captain. In 1888, Powers ran for alderman of Chicago's 19th ward and won, after which he closed his grocery, but continued to run his saloon, eventually going into business with fellow an alderman, William O'Brian, to open a larger saloon which included gambling. Powers introduced the practice of distributing free turkeys, ducks, and geese to voters at Christmas, but his inability to keep his ward clean of garbage or maintain the schools led Jane Addams to target him. Addams also focused on Powers' corruption, citing instances of cronyism and bribery. Powers, in turn, used Addams's attacks on him to brand her as anti-Catholic, but he also hired her to be the ward's garbage inspector, the only paying job she ever held. In 1903, Powers ran against incumbent Peter F. Galligan for the state senate. During the campaign, Galligan showed up at Powers's home and attacked him with a brickbat. Powers won the election, but the following year he returned to Chicago and was reelected to serve as the 19th ward alderman, a position he retained until 1927. By the 1910s, the ethnic makeup of his ward had begun to change. Instead of being 90 percent Irish, it was only about 50 percent Irish, with the remainder being made up of Italian and Jewish immigrants. On September 28, 1920, a bomb exploded at Powers' home at 1284 Macalister shortly after he arrived, this proved to be the opening salvo in the 1921 aldermanic election. In 1921, Anthony D'Andrea, who Powers had supported for ward committeeman in 1919, but pulled his support after the Supreme Court negated D'Andrea's initial victory, challenged Powers for his seat as alderman. The election was marked by violence, which continued after Powers won the election by 381 votes. Shortly after the election, D'Andrea was assassinated. This election was the culmination of the Aldermen's Wars. Powers died as his home at 6038 Sheridan Road, on May 19, 1930, suffering from pulmonary edema and anemia, although he had been suffering throat tumors since 1929."

He was the son of James Read. He was an officer in Oliver Cromwell's army, and a soldier from the age of sixteen. When Charles II of England was restored to the throne, Read left for America. He settled first in Providence, Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. In Providence, he married Anne Samson Derby. He later moved to Rye, Province of New York, in 1684, where he lived for three or four years. He then established himself in the western part of Norwalk, at a house he built on the eastern side of the Five Mile River, north of the Old Post Road and nearly two miles from the Long Island Sound at a place called Reed's Farms. His name is found among the records of the town of Norwalk in 1687. John Read was admitted to the bar in 1708 in Norwalk, Connecticut. His house was used for a meeting place for some years. His wife died and he married again to the Widow Scofield from Stamford. He died in Norwalk, in the ninety-eighth year of his age, in 1730, and was interred in a tomb on his own farm."

In this role he was on a committee to draft instructions to Providence citizens in regards to protesting the egregious Stamp Act passed by the British parliament to tax the American colonists. During the lead up to the American Revolutionary War Cole was privy to the plan and execution of the burning of the British revenue schooner Gaspee that ran aground near Pawtuxet, Rhode Island. He was deeply complicit with Stephen Hopkins and other leading Providence citizens in withholding evidence from the British commission of inquiry that was established to find the instigators of the Gaspee Affair. After a year of collecting testimonies, the court dissolved, having failed to indict a single person. In 1775 Cole became the Advocate General of Rhode Island's Vice Admiralty Court, but died of smallpox just two years later."

  "text" : "Edson Jonasi Zvobgo (2 October 1935 – 22 August 2004) was a founder of Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF, was the Patriotic Front's spokesman at the Lancaster House in late 1979, a Harvard-trained lawyer, and a poet. His name is often misspelled by the media, either as Eddison instead of Edson or Zvogbo instead of Zvobgo. He was born in then Southern Rhodesia in 1935, near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo), where his father was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1960, Zvobgo won a scholarship to Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts aged 25. After taking a bachelor's degree there in 1964, he returned home to be arrested and detained for political activism against white rule in Rhodesia, along with Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo. Zvobgo was freed in 1971, and he spent a period in exile in Canada. He then studied law at Harvard and international relations at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, followed by a position as associate professor teaching criminal law at Lewis University College in Illinois. Zvobgo played a key role in international negotiations at Lancaster House that ended the bitter bush war and led to British-sponsored all race elections ahead of independence in 1980. He was the Zanu-PF spokesman, and impressed many in the international press with his quick repartee and astute analysis of the negotiations. In the 1980 elections, he won a seat in parliament for Masvingo, which he continued to hold until his death. An influential member of Zimbabwe's first fully independent cabinet, Zvobgo was minister for local government and housing until 1982, and minister for justice until 1985. As minister of parliamentary and constitutional affairs, in 1987 he made several amendments to the Constitution that concentrated power in the hands of the president and moved Zimbabwe towards a one-party state. Initially a staunch supporter of Zanu-PF policies, in later years he criticised Robert Mugabe's autocratic rule. In 1992 Zvobgo was moved to the less influential post of Minister of Mines. In 1996 he survived a car accident, in which both his legs were broken. This accident was considered suspicious by many. Shortly after the accident Mugabe demoted Zvobgo further to Minister Without Portfolio, and, in 2000, he was dropped from the cabinet altogether. In the 2002 presidential elections, he refused to campaign for Mugabe, but did not endorse the opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). He also voiced his opposition to the sweeping media law, passed the same year, calling it \"the most serious assault on our constitutional liberties since independence\". Despite his criticism, Zvobgo eventually voted for the legislation, which was used to close off Zimbabwe's only privately owned daily newspaper, The Daily News, and to arrest at least 31 independent journalists. He became the subject of an internal party disciplinary inquiry in 2003 for his refusal to campaign for Mugabe and after describing the laws as a weapon to stifle opposition to the government, but allegations of disloyalty were eventually dropped. Zvobgo had also been accused of holding private talks with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change as the ruling party abandoned formal dialogue between the two parties. Zvobgo died on 22 August 2004 after a lengthy battle with cancer. His wife Julia Tukai Zvobgo, a former Zanu-PF MP, died in February 2004 at the age of 67. He is survived by his seven children, Kerina, Edson Junior, Tsungirirai, Jonasi, Esther, Tendai and Farai Emily."

For nearly two years Walden was the only lawyer west of Batavia. He invested heavily in real estate in this area, owning what became known as Walden Farm at what is now Fillmore and Walden Avenue. In 1812, he married Suzanna Marvin. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Cattaraugus, Chautauqua and Niagara Co.) in 1812. During the War of 1812 Walden leased land to the Federal government and the Buffalo Barracks are erected. The front portion of the barracks later became what is the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site. He was one of the few who stayed behind during the burning of Buffalo and trying to save as many lives as possible. Walden's home was used by General Winfield Scott as his headquarters. After the war, he erected the first brick dwelling in Buffalo. He was one of the four original trustees of the village of Buffalo and served as a member of the Buffalo Harbor Company, which improved Buffalo's harbor to attract the village as the western terminus of the Erie Canal. Walden became the first judge of Erie County Court in 1823 and held the position for five years. He was a presidential elector in 1828. On March 13, 1838, the Common Council met and made Walden its choice for mayor. During his term, the entire school system was reorganized. After his term as mayor, Walden retired to his farm in Lake View, New York. He died there on November 10, 1857, and was buried in the Myer-Walden mausoleum in Forest Lawn Cemetery."

  "text" : "Edgerton Winnett Day (November 26, 1863 – February 11, 1919) was a Canadian politician and pioneer settler in the area that became province of Alberta, Canada. Born in 1863 in an area later incorporated into the Canadian province of Ontario, Day completed his education, and took up a job as a stagecoach driver. Soon after, he would find employment at the Massey-Harris company, an agricultural equipment manufacturer. During this time, Day first surveyed the land that he would eventually settle later on in his life. After briefly working as a loan company, Day moved to the west, after having aspirations of doing so since his youth. As the Canadian Pacific Railway gained entitlement to a portion of land in the prairies, Day became interested in purchasing a large portion, and did so in 1904. He then completed plans for what would later become the town that bears his name, Daysland, in present-day Flagstaff County, Alberta. Daysland was formed in 1905, when the railway line to the area was completed. Soon after, a large colonial-style house was built as a home for Day and his wife. Fitted with the latest appliances and technology at the time, it soon became the centre of the town, serving as an ice rink and tennis court, and hosting events, including auctions. After the opening of a post office in 1907, Daysland was officially incorporated as a town, with Day elected its first mayor. He would continue to serve in the capacity until his resignation in 1910. Two years later, Day moved to Edmonton, where he served as a major in the Army Reserve until his death from a long illness in 1919."

He holds the title of Florida's longest-serving state legislator. He earned the nickname \"Banty Rooster\" – after the diminutive, swaggering barnyard fowl – and became known for his eccentric mannerisms and colorful, folksy expressions. Childers was popular in his district for the ample state funding and \"turkey\" projects he sent home, including $12.5 million for the Pensacola Civic Center and the I-110 extension to Gregory Street. Initially a Democrat, he switched to the Republican Party in 1995. After term limits forced him from the Florida Senate in 2000, Childers ran for the District 1 seat of the Escambia County Commission. He became embroiled in the soccer complex corruption scandal and was found guilty of violating the Florida Sunshine Law and of bribing Commissioner Willie Junior to help push the purchases of two properties, totaling $6.2 million, from Childers' associates Joe and Georgann Elliott. Childers served nearly three years of a 42-month prison sentence in West Palm Beach and was released on 17 June 2009, after which he relocated away from Pensacola. On 8 June 2010, a federal appeals court overturned the bribery conviction, ruling that Childers' constitutional right to confront his accuser had been violated, as the defense team was not allowed to question Junior on his change of testimony."

When he was a 27-year-old bereaved dalit, Sampla was trying to find his feet against the oppressive landlords of Jalandhar's Sofi Pind. His brother and he were left to fend for themselves after their father's death and Sampla went off to Saudi Arabia in 1979 to work for a plumbing company. On his swearing-in as BJP's first minister from Punjab in NDA-II, he says, \"I often recall one incident that shaped my life. While I was in Saudi Arabian city of Damam, I was asked to clean human excreta and repair a bathroom. I was young and flatly refused to do the cleaning part while telling the building owner that I was a plumber. On my insistence, the man put on plastic gloves and cleaned the muck himself. It taught me the difference between oppression against dalits and the will to work\", Sampla recalled."

  "text" : "Lawrence \"Larry\" J. Pogemiller (born September 18, 1951) is a politician from Minnesota, the Commissioner of the Minnesota Office of Higher Education. A member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, he represented northeast Minneapolis districts in the Minnesota Legislature from 1981 to 2011, and served as the Senate's majority leader from 2007 to 2011. As majority leader, he was chair of the Senate Rules Committee and its subcommittees, and also served on the Senate Tax Committee. Pogemiller was born in Minneapolis and graduated from DeLaSalle High School in 1969. He was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1980, serving as the representative of District 55A from 1981 to 1983. After serving one term, he was elected to the Senate in 1982, serving the old District 58 prior to the 1992 redistricting and, thereafter, District 59. He was re-elected in every general election. He was appointed Director of the Higher Education office in October 2011 by Governor of Minnesota Mark Dayton. Pogemiller is known for his outspoken, assertive leadership style and his strategic thinking. Reporter Tom Scheck of Minnesota Public Radio called him \"a brilliant and combative political tactician who often speaks his mind\". Former Minnesota House Speaker Steve Sviggum called him \"a very frustrating individual as he runs the clock past midnight all the time.\" Pogemiller had a rocky relationship with former Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty."

  "text" : "Alan Robert Lindsay \"Lin\" Gordon (19 January 1917 – 16 June 2011) was an Australian politician. He was the Labor member for Murrumbidgee in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1970 to 1984. He was Minister for Conservation and Water Resources from 1976 to 1981 (with Conservation replaced by Lands and Forests in 1980), Minister for Local Government and Lands from 1981 to 1984, and Minister for Lands and Ports for a few months in 1984. Gordon was born in Cessnock to baker David Irvine Gordon and Mary Mildred Cleary. He was educated at government schools in Cessnock and after graduating was apprenticed to a pharmacy. He attended the University of Sydney, graduating in 1945. On 6 November 1943 he married Valerie Merle Webber, with whom he had five children. He subsequently owned a pharmacy, and also a trotting stud near Leeton. A Roman Catholic, he joined the Australian Labor Party in 1962. In 1965, he was elected to Leeton Shire Council, where he served until 1970 (including a year as President, 1969–1970). When Al Grassby, Labor member for Murrumbidgee, resigned in 1969 to contest the federal seat of Riverina, Gordon was selected as the Labor candidate for the resulting by-election, which took place early in 1970. He easily defeated his Liberal and Country Party opponents. In 1976, he was appointed to the ministry, holding the Conservation and Water Resources portfolios. He briefly served as Acting Minister for Health in 1977, for Local Government in 1978 and for Corrective Services in 1979. In 1980 the Conservation portfolio was split into Lands and Forests, both of which were retained by Gordon. In 1981 his Forests and Water Resources portfolios were exchanged for Local Government, which in turn was exchanged for Ports in 1984. Gordon retired in 1984; his seat was won by National Party candidate Adrian Cruickshank in his absence. Gordon died at his Wagga Wagga home on 16 June 2011."

Laws was also a co-host on the Internet show Every Way Woman from 2008 - December 2013, and she hosted her own Los Angeles TV show called Uncommon Sense from October 2007 until September 2010. Laws and her guests discussed news and current events. Laws is a former member of the Greater Valley Glen Council in Valley Glen, California. She was termed out of office in 2012, after serving four two-year terms. She was the first politician to run on the platform that she represents all beings in her district, not just the humans whom she maintains are the elite. She promotes moving from a democracy to what she calls an omniocracy, a government with representation for all living beings. In May 2006, Laws was appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to serve on the city’s 912 Commission, which was also called the Neighborhood Council Review Commission. In 1999, the Los Angeles City Charter mandated that a commission would be formed seven years later to review the progress, successes and failures of the city’s Neighborhood Council system. Laws is the founder and president of two organizations: the Directors of Animal Welfare (DAW) and the League for Earth and Animal Protection (LEAP). In 2006, Laws was the recipient of the Los Angeles Animal Humanitarian Award. Laws is a vegan and an advocate of that diet."

He turned down a basketball scholarship to Canisius College in Buffalo in order to play professionally to earn money. He played with the once world champion German Orioles and the Buffalo Lincolns basketball teams, and also played semi-pro baseball with the Easter Brands. He boxed with the Western New York AAU and was a contender for the U.S. Olympic boxing team. He was married to a Polish-American woman, Stephanie Adamski. His family started Walden Bottling Works in 1924; he managed the company in his spare time. In late 1942, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces as a private and was sent to Officers' Training School. He saw service in the U.S. Southwest before serving five months in the Pacific Theater during World War II. In April 1946 he was discharged as a lieutenant-colonel. He was active in veterans organizations. In 1951, Kowal was elected Buffalo city comptroller on the Republican ticket. He was defeated in his run for mayor in the 1957 election by Frank A. Sedita, but prevailed in the mayoral election held on November 7, 1961. He served a single term as mayor. On September 28, 1966, he died in his sleep."

During the confirmation process for Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, she was (metaphorically) Judge Sotomayor's sherpa. She holds a B.A. in art history from Oberlin College (1979), and a J.D. from the University of Virginia Law School (1984). She was Notes Editor of the Virginia Law Review, then a clerk for U.S. District Court judge Edward Norman Cahn in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. She was an associate at Williams & Connolly, before going to work for Biden (1991–1996). She advised Biden unofficially while she stayed home raising her children. She and her husband both contributed to Democratic National Committee (1992). She gave money to Ralph Neas (1997) in his unsuccessful attempt to unseat Connie Morella in Maryland's 8th congressional district. Her husband has consistently donated to his employer's (the Arent Fox law firm) political action committee; the firm appears to contribute to the party of the incumbent President of the United States."

He is against same-sex marriage, foreign ownership of land and housing and \"anti-smacking\" legislation. In June 2015, Craig resigned as leader of the Conservative Party following allegations of inappropriate behaviour surrounding the party's former press secretary Rachel MacGregor and tensions with the party's governing board. Craig has since admitted to inappropriate conduct with MacGregor but has denied charges of sexual harassment. On 27 June, Colin Craig was formally suspended from the Conservative Party. Since then, his suspension has been invalidated which would enable Craig to contest the Conservative Party's leadership. On 16 November 2015, Craig announced that he would not be contesting the Conservative Party leadership in lieu of a police investigation against him over his Party's spending during the 2014 general election."

He was born in Joliet, Illinois on September 22, 1867, the son of William F. Stewart (b. Ohio) and Julia Ann Hutchins (b. Maysville, Kentucky). He married Annie Mabel Nash in Titusville on May 24, 1888. She was the daughter of Clarence and Annie Hyatt Nash, a wealthy family from Norwalk, Connecticut with a home in Daytona. He and his wife Annie Mabel Nash Stewart came to Melbourne in 1888. They were well educated and cultured, but wanted to be pioneers. He was elected mayor in 1890 when he was only 23. He opened a hardware store and mortuary on New Haven Ave named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Frank Fee, who would also serve as mayor. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee and Stewart founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. In 1908, he was a presidential elector for the Republican Party. Documentation exists from as early as 1898 in the form of letters and invoices, books and newspaper articles reflecting his business was already located at 1002 E New Haven Ave, Melbourne, FL. In 1919, Stewart's Front Street store burned down, along with most of the downtown businesses in \"The Great Fire.\" After this time, the downtown was no longer in that area, but moved to the west side of U.S. 1. Stewart moved his business to New Haven Avenue. He may have moved his business to 1002 E New Haven Ave before the fire of 1919. In 1920, he was a co-founder of the Melbourne Golf and Country Club. He died in Melbourne, Florida, on June 18, 1936. He was buried in Daytona Beach, Florida."

  "text" : "William \"Bill\" McBride (May 10, 1945 – December 22, 2012) was an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he challenged Jeb Bush for Florida governor in the 2002 gubernatorial election. Bush won by a 56 to 43 percent margin, making him the first Republican governor of Florida to serve two terms. McBride had earlier defeated former United States Attorney General Janet Reno in the Democratic primary. McBride was born in Belleville, Illinois and grew up in Leesburg, Florida. He graduated from the University of Florida in 1967. While at UF, McBride served as treasurer of Florida Blue Key and was inducted into the University of Florida Hall of Fame. McBride served in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1971. McBride was awarded a Bronze Star with a Valor device. Upon his return to the United States, McBride taught at Officer Candidates School at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Upon leaving the Marine Corps, McBride attended the University of Florida Law School. While studying law he fell under the tutelage of Chesterfield Smith, a powerful politically connected Florida attorney and then president of the American Bar Association. McBride left law school for a time to serve as Smith's assistant at the ABA. After graduation, McBride joined Smith's Tampa law firm, Holland & Knight, where he rose in the ranks until becoming managing partner in 1992. McBride's tenure at the helm of Holland & Knight has been the source of some controversy. He is credited with having expanded the firm's size and power and with having helped to make it the seventh-largest firm in the U.S. by number of lawyers employed at the time of his retirement in 2001. At the time the firm ranked 21st in terms of revenue but 98th in terms of profit-per-partner, and had \"become known as a reputable, but flabby, operation, long on underproductive partners and comparatively short on workhorse associates.\" McBride was the father of two children with his wife, Adelaide \"Alex\" Sink, a former statewide president for NationsBank (now Bank of America), former Chief Financial Officer of Florida, and 2010 Democratic nominee for Governor of Florida. Since 2003, Bill McBride was partner with the law firm of Barnett, Bolt, Kirkwood, Long & McBride in Tampa. He was also chair of the board of the investment banking firm Hyde Park Capital Partners, LLC, with offices in Tampa and Charlotte, North Carolina. McBride was a member of the American Law Institute and was a member of the board of directors of the Warrington College of Business Administration's Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Florida. McBride was named Mr. Leesburg High while still a student. He attended Boy's State while in school and ran a successful campaign for governor at the event. McBride died on December 22, 2012, after suffering a heart attack while vacationing with his family in Mt Airy, North Carolina."

Prior to his election on the board, he ran third in an unsuccessful bid to unseat Sam Yorty for Mayor of Los Angeles in 1969. Ward served as a supervisor from 1972–1980. As supervisor Ward was a strong advocate for public transport. Under his aegis the county acquired eight rail cars, dubbed El Camino, to bootstrap commuter rail in the Los Angeles area. This effort failed, although the cars operated on Amtrak's San Diegan route for six months in 1978. Critics dubbed the train \"Baxter Ward's Choo-Choo\" and it contributed to his failed re-election in 1980. He was born Baxter Ward Schwellenbach in Superior, Wisconsin, and grew up in Ephrata, Washington. He was the nephew of Lewis Baxter Schwellenbach. During the 1950s and early 60s he introduced a non-fiction documentary television show called Adventure Tomorrow with Dr. Martin L. Klein, which presented technology of the exciting years of the early Space Age. The program's producer, George Van Valkenburg described the series as covering anything that moves, flies or explodes. , Ward was a television news anchor first at KCOP-Channel 13, and then with KABC-Channel 7 in Los Angeles before he ran for Mayor."

As of 2005, she is the chief of the DAP Malacca women's wing, and also represents the constituency of Kota Laksamana in the State Assembly of Malacca. She is also married to the current Chief Minister of the State of Penang who also the Secretary-General of the DAP, YAB Tuan Lim Guan Eng, and is the daughter-in-law of the former Opposition Leader in the Parliament of Malaysia, Lim Kit Siang, who is also of the DAP. In 2005, she suffered a surprise defeat when running for re-election to the DAP Malacca committee, placing second-last, finishing ahead of only her husband. However, while her husband automatically qualified to sit on the committee by virtue of his position as party Secretary-General, Chew did not. Chew was \"saddened by the results\", but said she accepted her defeat. However, Teresa Kok, a DAP Member of Parliament, suggested there was a conspiracy behind the defeat of Lim and Chew in their re-election campaigns. In 2006, it was reported that Chew would become the first Malacca assemblyman to give birth while in office. At the time, Chew had three children with Lim: Rachael, aged 15, Clint, aged 14, and Marcus, aged 11. In 2008, Chew defeated newcomer Lee Kiat Lee for the Kota Laksamana seat where she had 11043 votes while Lee had only 3801 votes."

Clark served as mayor until 1988, when he left the mayor's office in a bid to become MLA for the riding of Cape Breton East, running as a candidate for the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia under the leadership of John Buchanan. Clark lost the election to John MacEachern, who was the Liberal candidate. During his time as mayor, Clark achieved success for the town in a variety of ways, perhaps most notable is the cleanup project of Glace Bay's sewage area, spearheading the development of Renwick Brook. As a result of Clark's efforts some still refer to Renwick Brook as \"Bruce's Brook\". Clark ran for mayor of Glace Bay once again in 1991 and lost by a narrow margin to Donald MacInnis. Clark currently holds a management position with the Nova Scotia Community College. Although no longer directly involved in politics, he still remains an avid follower of local, provincial and federal politics. Clark is married to Jane (Burden) Clark, a retired schoolteacher and the couple still reside in Glace Bay. They have been married since 1975 and have three children."

During his six-year tenure he attracted nearly $750 million of economic development to Clearwater including a sweeping redevelopment of the city's number-one economic engine, Clearwater Beach. Mayor Aungst served on Pinellas County's Tourist Development Council, the advisory board of Pinellas County's Convention and Visitors Bureau, using his position as mayor to encourage tourists to visit the area, especially after the events of 9/11/2001. Aungst was instrumental in putting together a public-private partnership to build a new Community Sports Complex Bright House Networks Field to host Philadelphia Phillies Spring Training Baseball and their minor league team the Clearwater Threshers and other community events. In addition he spearheaded a public-private partnership to build a new 90,000-square-foot (8,400 m2) signature public library in downtown Clearwater. Under his leadership the city built multiple community recreation centers and athletic complexes and was named Sports Illustrated magazine's \"Sports Town USA\" for the state of Florida. He was the first Mayor of Clearwater, Florida to be re-elected unopposed since 1956. Aungst supported his successor Mayor Frank Hibbard who was elected unopposed to replace him in 2005 and re-elected in 2008. Brian Aungst presided over the Clearwater City Commission for almost six years of unprecedented growth."

  "text" : "Bernard J. Berry (July 3, 1913 – January 6, 1963) was an American Democratic Party politician who served as the 33rd mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey from 1953 to 1957. He took office following the resignation of John V. Kenny. Berry achieved a level of notoriety for having banned both rock and roll music as well as an \"obscene\" film from Jersey City during his tenure. Berry banned the film The Moon Is Blue from being shown for being \"indecent and obscene\" and refused to allow Bill Haley and the Comets to play a concert at municipally-owned Roosevelt Stadium. The latter act is believed to have inspired Haley to write the first protest song in rock and roll, \"Teenager's Mother,\" which included the lyrics \"Are you right? Did you forget too soon? How much you liked to do the Charleston?\" In 1956, after the 1954 closing of the US immigration station, Berry commandeered a US Coast Guard cutter and led a contingent of New Jersey officials on an expedition to claim Ellis Island."

McGroarty was from East End and was born on December 22, 1962. In 1983, McGroarty was elected to Wilkes-Barre City Council and served for twelve years before his election as mayor. McGroarty graduated from Coughlin High School, Luzerne County Community College and Bloomsburg University. He was both an officer and enlisted member of the 109th Field Artillery, where he served as service battery commander. McGroarty was elected mayor in 1995 and re-elected in 1999. He was the only mayor to be elected both as a Democratic and Republican, having waged a successful write in campaign as a Republican in 1995. By securing the both nominations, McGroarty enjoyed relationships with both Democratic and Republicans officials. McGroarty expanded city services in each of the city's twelve neighborhoods. But his main focus became emergency preparedness and recovery, as a result of a blizzard and significant flooding in his first month in office. McGroarty met President William J. Clinton at the White House, and hosted the President during a tour of Wilkes-Barre on February 16, 1996. During his visit, President Clinton announced federal funding for the Wyoming Valley Levee Raising Project, which provided flood protection. Long after McGroarty's departure, those same levees, enhanced on his watch, protected Wilkes-Barre in September 2011, when river levels were 42.66 feet, 1.75 feet above the flood level of Hurricane Agnes."

At the time of his death, his estate was worth US$6 million ($170.7 million today). Blackstone served as president of the Chicago and Alton Railroad from 1864 through 1899, was a founding president of the Union Stock Yards, and served one term as mayor of La Salle, Illinois. An active philanthropist, Blackstone was the benefactor of the James Blackstone Memorial Library in Branford, Connecticut. A nearly identical library, Blackstone Memorial Library, was donated to the Chicago Public Library by Timothy Blackstone's widow in 1902.

Catanzariti was born in Platì in Calabria, southern Italy. His father left Italy for Australia in late 1949 with the hope of finding work and stability to raise his family. He first went to Adelaide and later moved to Griffith, New South Wales. His mother migrated to Australia when Catanzariti was just one year old and arrived in Griffith in September 1950. Catanzariti joined the Labor party in 1969 and held a number of party positions prior to his election to the Legislative Council in 2003. He also served as a board member at Murrumbidgee Electricity and the Sydney Market Authority; and as a councillor at Griffith City Council. During the 2007 election campaign, the opposition National Party of Australia accused Catanzariti of offering to fund independent candidate Mike Neville's campaign for the Nationals-held seat of Murrumbidgee. Catanzariti admitted he had suggested Neville stand for the seat, but denied that funding had been offered or provided. Neville was easily defeated in Murrumbidgee by sitting Nationals MP Adrian Piccoli. Catanzariti is married to Mary Catanzariti and together they have three sons and a daughter."

This farm was expressly included in Nansemond County when the Assembly drew its boundary with Isle of Wight County in 1674. In March 1676 he was identified as colonel of the Nansemond militia when he was authorized to raise a force to fight Indians. Godwin was not a member of the General Assembly of 1661–76. When it was dissolved and a new Assembly met in June 1676, he was elected Speaker of the House. This Assembly, which met just before the outbreak of Bacon's Rebellion, had all its acts annulled by the Assembly that met the following year, although a number of them were reenacted by that same session.

In the 38th Parliament Fleming was the New Democrat critic for Advanced Education, sat on the Select Standing Committee on Education, and introduced two education-related private member bills: the Private Post-Secondary Accountability and Student Protection Act, 2007 and the Restoring Credibility to Universities Act, 2008. He was also assigned to the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts and introduced the Payday Lending Act, 2006 which sought to regulate the conditions of payday loans and led to the government adopting the Business Practices and Consumer Protection (Payday Loans) Amendment Act a year later. In the 39th Parliament Fleming became the NDP's environment critic. He introduced the Cosmetic Pesticide and Carcinogen Control Act and sat on the subsequent Special Committee on Cosmetic Pesticides which investigated potential bans or regulations on pesticides used for cosmetic purposes. Fleming also introduced the Species at Risk Protection Act, after the government delayed a promise to review its species-at-risk legislation, and the Sustainable Development Indicators and Reporting Act, 2011 which sought to create a Sustainable Development Board to report on provincial sustainability-related indicators. Fleming sat on the Select Standing Committee on Legislative Initiatives which considered the petition seeking the repeal of the Harmonized Sales Tax."

While his party formed a majority government, Howard was not included in Gordon Campbell's cabinet but was appointed to several committees, including the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts in the first two sessions, and Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services in the third and fourth session.

(Corporate Restoration) Act, 2009 (Pr 402), to retroactively restore that organization's corporate status. As chair of the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services, Howard supported Premier Campbell's efforts at establishing the Harmonized Sales Tax. Following Campbell's resignation, Howard endorsed Kevin Falcon but Christy Clark won the leadership election. Clark eventually made Howard a Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Transportation. In this position he advocated for Open Sky agreements and continued this advocacy in his post-political life by establishing the non-profit organization OpenSkies4Canada. Howard did not seek re-election during the 2013 provincial election and was replaced by BC Liberal Teresa Wat. Prior to his election to the legislature, Howard worked in property management. He served as a City Councillor in the Richmond, British Columbia for seven years.

Terrill was found guilty of bribery in connection with the 2010 Oklahoma political corruption investigation concerning the Office of the Oklahoma Chief Medical Examiner in which he bribed State Senator Debbe Leftwich (D-Oklahoma City) to give up her seat so State Representative Mike Christian (R-Oklahoma City) could run for it instead. On October 29, 2013, a jury convicted Terrill of bribery and recommended he receive a sentence of one year in prison and a $5,000 fine. Christian and Leftwich were not charged."

He was the first Democrat elected Erie County Executive and the first Erie County Executive elected to three four-year terms. Gorski was an Erie County Legislator and a member of the New York State Assembly prior to three-term service as county executive. During his second term as County Executive, he ran for Congress to succeed Democrat Henry Nowak, but he was defeated in the general election by Republican Jack Quinn. Like many Buffalo Democrats, including Buffalo Mayors Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, Gorski was known for being more conservative than the mainstream Democratic Party platform, and was regularly cross-endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York. As county executive, he rivaled his contemporary Buffalo Mayors and on some issues his contemporary New York State Governors in power: He succeeded in bringing the World University Games to Buffalo, and since the National Football League Buffalo Bills play in suburban Orchard Park, New York it was his responsibility to broker a deal to keep the team from leaving town. He also helped the National Hockey League Buffalo Sabres finance Marine Midland Arena (now known as First Niagara Center). During his early years he brought about economic recovery and kept the county on solid financial footing during his tenure. He has been described as the only County Executive to balance the budget. Gorski is a Vietnam War veteran and remained active in Veteran's affairs while in office. Since leaving the county executive's office, he has worked in private business in Buffalo, New York. Gorski spent his first nine years of public life working for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) and was subsequently was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo."

Itse has explained his proposition on the national Glenn Beck interview program on Fox news. Itse's resolution in the New Hampshire legislature inspired other state legislatures to do the same (possibly as many as 20.) When he was eight years old, Itse moved with his family to Sherborn, Massachusetts. He graduated in 1976 from Dover-Sherborn High School. and then enrolled at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, from which in 1980 he procured a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering. He earned a master of science in the same field in 1986, also from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He is a registered professional engineer in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts. From 1979-1989, he worked for the Riley Stoker Corporation. He was chief engineer of Physical Sciences, Inc., from 1989-1994. Since 1994, he has owned Christofferson Engineering. An inventor, Itse holds patents on (1) a low-emissions burner for coal-fired power plants, (2) a low-emissions combustion system for waste-to-energy, (3) a process for disposing of heavy metals, and (4) a device to enhance the injection of chemicals for reducing pollution from power plants. In 2009, Itse was working on the air pollution control system for the largest wood-fired power plant in North America. Since 2001, Itse has represented Rockingham County, which is located in the southeastern corner of the state, in the legislature, which meets in the capital city of Concord. He has served on the Children and Family Law and the Science, Technology and Energy committees. He once had the best attendance record in the legislature. He claims to vote in all cases in accordance with a literal reading of the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire, and personal liberty and property. In the 2011/2012 term he was the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Review and Statutory Recodification. In that term he saw the creation of the Committee on Redress of Grievances Chaired by Rep. Paul Ingbretson. The peoples right of redress as a positive right in New Hampshire was brought to light as a result of his commentary on the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire, \"The People's Liberty\". An advocate of judicial reform, Itse supports constitutional amendments regarding the recognition of marriage, parental rights, prohibiting a state income tax, and affirming the right to petition the legislature for redress of grievances. He is a nationally prominent advocate of the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the assertion of state sovereignty.Though his sovereignty amendment was rejected by his New Hampshire colleagues, it inspired similar proposals in some twenty states as well as the \"Tea Party\" demonstrations in April 2009. In 1979, while he was a senior in college, Itse married the former Lisa Mullins. The couple has five children, born between 1983 and 1995. The youngest, Jarrod, is handicapped. In the 2008 Republican presidential contest, Itse was a supporter of U.S. Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado. Itse is scheduled to address the national committee meeting of the Constitution Party to be held June 11–13 in Newark, New Jersey. In 2014 Itse authored \"States Have Powers - the Powers of the People, use 'em or lose 'em\" (available on Amazon). The book is an expository on his 2012 sovereignty resolution. It explains why the People are in fact in supreme power in America, and the intended distribution of power between the government of the United States and the States and between the three branches of government: Legislative, Executive and Judicial. At their 2015 Liberty Dinner, the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance revealed that Itse was chosen as legislator of the year."

He had his men cut ice from the Ohio River that winter, when it froze over, packed it in sawdust and dispensed it to Ashland residents, who made ice-houses for storage. He was also a contractor and house-builder, operated a livery stable on Greenup Avenue, opened and operated the first dime store in the city, served as a conductor on the A. C. & I. Railroad, and was overseer of a poor house. The 1880 Census lists David as living with his wife, Mary Anne, and children Edwin, Nellie, Harlan, and Raymond.

His most notable duty was as commander of the Snowbirds Air Demonstration Team - 431 Squadron. In 1986, he was made an Officer of the Order of Military Merit. In 1997, he ran for the leadership of the fledgling Saskatchewan Party. He finished 3rd among three candidates. In 1999, in his first run at public office, he narrowly lost election in the Wood River constituency as the Saskatchewan Party candidate. On election night, he tied Liberal candidate Glen McPherson. The returning officer cast the deciding vote in favour of McPherson. This result was later thrown out in court and a by-election was ordered. McPherson did not run and Huyghebaert then won a resounding victory. He was re-elected in 2003. On May 29, 2009, Huyghebaert was appointed to cabinet by Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall in the role of minister of Corrections, Public Safety and Policing."

Among her most significant impacts on Chicago were her advocacy for diverse, inclusive, affordable housing and helping craft Chicago's response to the HIV/AIDS crisis. Her commitment to fostering community development without displacement often brought Shiller into contention with some constituencies, real estate developers, and editorial boards.

  "text" : "Herbert Arthur Sinnott (January 7, 1871 – after 1923) was a Canadian educator, lawyer and municipal politician who served as the 18th mayor of Calgary, Alberta from 1913 to 1915. Sinnott was born in Kings County, New Brunswick on January 7, 1871 to David S., a farmer, and Frances (née Taylor) Sinnott. After attending schools in Sussex, New Brunswick, Sinnott graduated from Mount Allison University with a Bachelor of Arts and started his teaching career in Gagetown as principal of a grammar school. He later taught high school in Moncton, New Brunswick before moving west to Alberta in 1900. In 1903, he became a high school principal in Calgary, the first ever to the city. He began a career in law in 1908, articling under Thomas M. Tweedie. In 1911, he was called to the bar. Around this time, Sinnott also owned and rented out various properties in the city of Calgary as well as Lethbridge. He also served on the Calgary School Board as trustee in 1912 and 1920–22 along with chairman from 1908–11 and 1918–19. Sinnott was elected as Mayor of Calgary and served in this position from January 2, 1913 to January 2, 1915. During his time in office, oil was discovered within the city of Calgary, and it was said that the \"[whole city] quickly became oil conscious\". In January 1923, Sinnott pleaded guilty in a court to \"misappropriating clients' trust funds\" during his work as a lawyer in Calgary. During his trial, Sinnott admitted his guilt and was sentenced to seven years to be served in a Prince Albert, Saskatchewan jail. The magistrate had expressed that \"the more grievous\" crime that of the betrayal of trust of Sinnott to his clients, and that it was unfortunate that such a citizen of high of esteem, had admitted to committing the crimes. The magistrate also expressed that the punishment was decided to set a precedent and to \"deter others from doing the same thing\", along with restating that though it was hard to see \"a citizen of Mr. Sinnott's calibre\" take the sentence, it was a necessary justice. It is not known where Sinnott went after presumably leaving prison, although there have been rumours that he may have moved to Australia shortly thereafter. He married Margaret Horne, a graduate nurse and daughter of a sea captain, in 1901 and had one child with her, Margaret. His wife died in 1906. A conservative in politics, during his time in Calgary, Sinnott was a member of the Ancient Order of Foresters in Calgary as well as the Methodist church. Sinnott was widely regarded for his work in the educational field, with a 1912 biography beginning with \"The educational annals of the Northwest present few names which shine with a brighter luster of good deeds done than the one which forms [this paragraph]\"."

He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1956 and 1960. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1963, where he served until his election to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1966. He eventually attained the chairmanship of the powerful Appropriations Committee from which position he worked closely with Speaker of the House Herbert Fineman to appropriate money to Philadelphia. In 1977, Cianfrani was convicted on federal charges of racketeering and mail fraud for padding his Senate payroll. His case was prosecuted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by U.S. attorney David W. Marston, who was later removed from the position by U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Cianfrani was sentenced to five years in federal prison. After serving for twenty-seven months, he was released in 1980. In the middle 1970s, he began dating political reporter Laura Foreman of The Philadelphia Inquirer. The two moved in together and she reportedly accepted money and gifts from him while she was still reporting on him for her newspaper. After the affair became public in 1977 she was fired by her employer, The New York Times. She and Cianfrani married in 1980, after his divorce from his first wife was finalized and he was released from federal prison. Years after his release, his political career enjoyed a resurgence. In 1988 Cianfrani won back his old position as Philadelphia ward leader and regained a measure of clout within Philadelphia politics. He was considered a mentor to many Philadelphia politicians, including Congressman Bob Brady and Senator Vince Fumo. Cianfrani died of a stroke in Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 3, 2002."

On May 14, 1861, in Ashland, a meeting of citizens was held in Central Park to recruit members for the Ashland Home Guard, an organization formed for \"the defense and protection of our families and homes\" from guerrilla raiders. The Home Guard had at the time of the meeting a roster of 31 members. Forty new members took an oath of allegiance to the state and nation at that time. Brodess was among them. Starting around November 15, 1862, Brodess served as a first lieutenant in Company A of the Fourteenth Kentucky Volunteer Infantry. He tendered his own resignation and was honorably discharged on November 17, 1862. In 1876, Brodess was elected mayor of Ashland, and a city council replaced to former town board. Mayor Brodess was elected for another two-year term in 1878, and again in 1880, but died in office. John Means was appointed to serve the remainder of his term. In 1912, his wife, Mary, claimed that, after his discharge, he was not paid travel pay, and she attempted to bring the case against the United States. On February 12 of that year it was decided that the claim was neither a legal nor equitable one, and any payment rested in the bounty of Congress"

He was the first of nine children of Theodore Titus, and Catharine Flick Howell. He was raised in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. He was enrolled for some time at the United States Military Academy at West Point, but did not graduate. In 1845, he was a postal inspector in Philadelphia. Titus was a leader of the Narciso López filibuster expeditions that invaded Cuba in 1850-1851. He was a grocer and sawmill operator in Jacksonville, until migrating with his family to \"Bleeding Kansas\" in April 1856 to join pro-slavery forces. He resided at \"Fort Titus,\" a double-log cabin one mile south of Lecompton, that came under artillery attack from John Brown's raiders on Aug. 16, 1856. He was wounded, captured, and exchanged for Free-State prisoners, before joining filibuster William Walker in Nicaragua in Feb. 1857. After his force was defeated at Castillo Viejo a few weeks later, Titus went to New York. He and his brother Elliot moved to the Sonoita Valley, Arizona, where they operated various ore mines during 1858-1860. Titus returned to Jacksonville during the American Civil War and served as assistant quartermaster in the Florida Militia. He was also working for the Florida Provision Company, a business owned by his father-in-law, Edward S. Hopkins. The firm sold supplies to the Confederate Army. While transporting a load of Confederate draft dodgers to Nassau in 1863, Titus lost his steamer to the Northern blockade and was captured on the Indian River. He eluded imprisonment and later returned to Florida with his family, preceding a post-war wave of newcomers. He moved to New York with his family in 1865, but returned to Florida in November 1867, settling at Sand Point which at that time had a population of 250. Titus built a sawmill, general store and hotel at that location. Titus was appointed postmaster, and soon thereafter renamed the settlement \"Titusville.\" The name of Titusville was determined by a dominoes game with Captain Clark Rice on October 16, 1873. He lobbied tirelessly to have Titusville named as county seat. His efforts were realized on October 7, 1879 when a vote was taken and the result supported relocation of the county seat to Titusville. He was also the Justice of the Peace, a notary public for Volusia County, and a marine insurance underwriter's agent. Rheumatic gout kept him confined to a wheelchair during the last years of his life."

He is a member of the Democratic Party. Born in Deweyville, Texas, Leggett attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and, after serving in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Army, earned a law degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1986, he became the first African-American elected to the county council in Montgomery County, Maryland and served on the council through 2002. He remains the only African-American ever elected to that body at-large. For two years, Leggett served as the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party before leaving that position to run for office once again. Leggett was elected County Executive of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office. Since taking office, Leggett has worked to put the County’s fiscal house in order while strengthening critical County services in education and public safety, and helping the most vulnerable. In the four years before Leggett took office, County spending grew by over 40 percent. In his first five years in office, Montgomery County's spending was held to zero percent. Responding to the worldwide recession that hit in 2008, Leggett closed budget gaps of over $2.6 billion, eliminating 10 percent of County government positions, while imposing furloughs (including himself), wage freezes, and changes in retirement and health benefits to save the County money. At the same time, Leggett put tens of millions of dollars into building and preserving thousands of units of affordable housing in the County, establishing a CountyStat office to ensure “real time” performance of County services, and set up a multi-agency Positive Youth Development Initiative to ensure positive programs for at-risk youth. Leggett worked to strengthen Montgomery County's biotechnology and life sciences sectors and also established the \"311\" Customer Service as a single point of entry via phone and the internet for residents seeking County services. During Leggett's first eight years, serious crime went down in the County by 24 percent and the Fire and Rescue Service's response times to Montgomery County's fires improved dramatically. Leggett was reelected to a second term in 2010 and to a third four-year term in 2014."

From International Falls, Anderson entered politics at approximately the same time that he was elected union president at the M & O Paper Company, the International Falls paper mill where he worked. A Democrat, he represented the old District 64 and 64B and, later, District 3A. The sprawling district included all or portions of Beltrami, Itasca, Koochiching, Lake of the Woods and St. Louis counties in the northern part of the state. Anderson served as majority leader of the House from 1973 to 1981, and again, briefly, in 1993 before becoming Speaker of the House in September 1993, a position he held until 1997. He continued to serve in the legislature until 2007, opting not to run for re-election in 2006 due to health concerns. Anderson fought in World War II as a United States Navy pilot from 1942 to 1945, earning the Air Medal for his performance. The Air Medal is awarded to any person who, while serving in any capacity in or with the Armed Forces of the United States, distinguishes themselves by meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight. He also helped create Minnesota's memorial to World War II veterans. Anderson died at Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids on November 17, 2008. He was buried in St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Cemetery in International Falls.

  "text" : "Osbeorn (died c. 1054), given the nickname Bulax, was the son of Siward, Earl of Northumbria (died 1055). He is one of two known sons — probably the older — of Siward. While it is normally assumed he was the son of Siward's Bamburgh wife Ælfflæd, it has been suggested by William Kapelle that Osbeorn's mother was not Ælfflæd. The nickname \"Bulax\" probably represents the Old Norse term for \"Poleaxe\". According to the most reliable sources, he died at the Battle of the Seven Sleepers, fought somewhere in Scotland between Siward and Mac Bethad mac Findlaích, King of the Scots, in 1054. Under this year, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, recension D, related that: \"At this time earl Siward went with a great army into Scotland, with both fleet and a land-force; and fought against the Scots, and put to flight the king Mac Bethad, and slew all that were best in the land, and brought thence much war-spoil, such as no man obtained before;   And there were slain his son Osbeorn, and his sister's son Siward, and some of his housecarls, and also of the king's, on the day of the Seven Sleepers (July 27).\"   This battle was fought somewhere in Scotland north of the Firth of Forth, and is known variously as the \"Battle of the Seven Sleepers\" or the \"Battle of Dunsinane\". The location Dunsinane is not accepted as historical by modern historians, resting as it does on later medieval accounts. The earliest mention of Dunsinane as the location of the battle being the early 15th-century account by Andrew of Wyntoun. In recension C of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the names of the slain are omitted, an omission repeated by the Chronicle of John of Worcester. Henry of Huntingdon related that Osbeorn had been sent to Scotland ahead of Siward:\"[Siward] sent his son to acquire Scotland. And when they reported to his father that he had been slain in battle, [Siward] said, 'Did he receive the mortal wound in front of his body, or behind?' The messengers said. 'In front'. And he replied: 'I rejoice wholly, for I would deem myself or my son worthy of no meaner death'. Siward therefore marched into Scotland and conquered the king battle ... \" Another legendary account, in the Vita et Passio Waldevi, a hagiography of Osbeorn's brother Waltheof, claimed that Osbeorn, called \"Osbert Bulax\", was killed by Northumbrians while his father was absent in Scotland. The accounts in Henry of Huntingdon and the Vita et Passio Waldevi are thought to be derived from a saga devoted to the life of Earl Siward. Geoffrey Gaimar's account related activity in 1053, an agreement made between Siward and Mac Bethad, but a death of Osbeorn is not mentioned. Osbeorn's death left Siward's legacy in danger. When he died the following year, his only son Waltheof was underage and thus did not succeed immediately to the whole territory ruled by Siward, Northumbria going instead to Tostig Godwinson."

His father, the late Mr. Jaffer Ali was a Paper mache artist and businessman. Sadiq Ali graduated from Aligarh Muslim University and earned his MA in Political Science. He has given some important recommendations about the solution of the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. His self-rule report has been widely applauded in both India and Pakistan and his recommendations have been regarded as one of the most workable solutions of this issue. He has also written a comprehensive paper on the deteriorating conditions of the forests of Jammu and Kashmir State; he has further submitted an indepth research paper outlining how the Dal Lake may be saved from further degradation. Mr Sadiq Ali entered politics at a very young age, and was one of the closest associates of Sheikh Abdullah, the founder of National Conference. He was nominated to the State Legislative Council numerous times. He also held the position of treasurer of the JKNC for 23 years. He quit National Conference stating personal reasons, although he never spoke against the NC party or its principles. There was widespread speculation that the only reason Mr Sadiq Ali quit NC was because of the NC leadership's inadequate action against a rival from within NC, whom Mr Sadiq had accused of sabotaging his re-election bid from Zadibal. On March 9, 2008, Farooq Abdullah, the patron of NC, announced to the media that Mr Sadiq Ali had rejoined the party and would be handling the state affairs of the party."

In the 39th Parliament, he introduced the Cave Protection Act, 2010 which proposed to create a registry of all cave sites and create legal protection for them.

Around 1802 he married Jane Oram and moved to Mahoning County, Ohio where he built a farm and the first grist mill in the area. He later married Sarah St. John and after her death Mary Peters. During the War of 1812 Wilkeson was asked to build a fleet of ships for the U.S. Army at Buffalo, brought his family there, and opened a general store. In 1815, he became the village's first Justice of the Peace and later chosen as a village trustee. He was a member of the Buffalo Harbor Company that brought the terminus of the Erie Canal to Buffalo, versus its rival Black Rock. In the early 1820s, he led the project to improve the harbor to make it suitable as the canal terminus. In February 1821, Wilkeson was appointed First Judge of the Court of Common Pleas and held this position until 1824. In the early 1820s he went into partnership with Ebenezer Johnson in shipping and real estate enterprises, and once owned the land on which the Buffalo City Hall now stands. His later ventures included building the first steam boiler in Buffalo and operating foundries or factories in several areas of the city. In 1822, Samuel Wilkeson was elected to the New York State Assembly and in 1824 was elected to the New York State Senate. In 1836, he was elected mayor of Buffalo. During his term he focused on law enforcement issues and presided over a city in the depths of a nationwide financial depression. After his term, in 1838, he became general agent of the American Colonization Society, who wanted to colonize African-Americans in Liberia. He died on July 7, 1848, on his way to visit his daughter who was now living in Tellico Plains, Tennessee. His body was brought back to Buffalo and buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery."

In 2008 Legislative Assembly Elections, he changed his constituency from Pilani to Surajgarh due to Reservation of Pilani Seat. He again won from Surajgarh beating Bhartiya Janta Party Candidate Santosh Ahlawat over a margin of nearly 8000 Votes. He again fought MLA elections in 2013 but lost to BJP candidate Santosh Ahlawat with over 50,000 Votes. His loss came as a surprise among the people and that too, with such a huge margin.

Graduating with a Bachelor of Arts from Macquarie University, Cotsis later completed a Master of Legal Studies at the University of Technology, Sydney. Prior to entering Parliament, Cotsis was a hospitality worker at Sydney Airport, later becoming an official with the Labor Council of New South Wales and subsequently the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union.

He was born in Hamilton City, (which at the time was a part of Colusa County) the son of Edward Tillotson Reynolds and Frances Elizabeth Barnard Reynolds who were early settlers of Colusa County. Reynolds attended Woodman’s Academy in Chico, and Chico State Normal School, to which he enrolled at the age of seventeen, and continued for two and a half years. He then quit school to work in the fruit and nut business with his father, in 1898, when the firm of E. T. Reynolds and Son was established. Initially, they leased a warehouse, and eventually they bought a warehouse at the corner of First and Cedar Streets in Chico. In 1902, they built another warehouse, which had a railroad spur adjoining it at First and Cherry Streets. This warehouse still existed into the 21st-century, and was part of the Chico State campus under the same name as \"Reynolds Warehouse.\" By 1915, they were the largest handlers of almonds in the state. Their dried fruit business grew to the capacity of thirty-five hundred tons annually. Reynolds, with in partnership with others, owned the Cana Land Company, which comprised two hundred acres of fruit and nuts at Cana. Reynolds married Helen Adelia \"Nellie\" Davisson, in Suisun, in 1908. She was a Chico Normal School graduate, and school teacher until her marriage. In 1915, he was elected from the third ward as a trustee of the city. He served as chairman of the commission on fire, light and water. In 1919, he was elected president of the board of trustees. On June 4, 1921, an election was held to choose a Board of Freeholders charged with framing a City Charter. On April 16, 1923, at-large elections were reinstated under the charter. Under the charter, the board of trustees was renamed the Chico City Council, and its chair was titled the Mayor. Reynolds was the last mayor to be titled \"president\" of the \"board of trustees\" before it became the modern Chico City Council."

A descendant of Captain Théophile de la Cour DesBrisay (1671–1761) whose Huguenot family fled religious persecution in France and settled in Dublin, Ireland before emigrating to Canada, Mather Byles DesBrisay was the great-great-grandson of Thomas DesBrisay, a Lieutenant-Governor of St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island). He was born in Chester, Nova Scotia and was educated in Halifax and Dartmouth. Trained in law, in 1851 Mather DesBrisay was admitted to the Bar of Nova Scotia. He eventually set up a law practice in his native Chester but in 1865 made Bridgewater his home. In 1867, DesBrisay entered provincial politics as part of the anti Confederation movement and in the Nova Scotia general election was voted to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. Reelected in 1874, the following year he was named Speaker of the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia. After 1875 DesBrisay was out of politics and in 1876 he married Ada Adams Harley. Mather DesBrisay served as a County Court judge for Lunenburg, Shelburne and Queens counties until 1897. An avid historian, in 1870 he published his book titled \"History of the County of Lunenburg.\" It marked what became a major pursuit of documentation that saw a revised edition of his book published in 1895. Following his death in 1900, the town of Bridgewater acquired his vast collection of papers and artifacts and established the DesBrisay Museum as a public community history museum. Mather and Ada DesBrisay are buried together in the Brookside Cemetery in Bridgewater."

Before her election, Tindal was already well-known within the United Church of Canada as the co-host of a United Church television program, Spirit Connection. She was also an adult educator, author, video producer, led pilgrimages to Iona (Scotland), was involved in continuing education in Jamaica, and just prior to her election, was Executive Director of Five Oaks Centre, one of the United Church’s education centres. In her remarks to the Council following her election, Tindal spoke of entering into a covenant with the church “as we live into ministry together.” Meeting with reporters afterwards, her first wish was to support the church in its desire to live in covenant relationship with God and with each other in a caring stewardship of Creation. “I am committed to encouraging young leaders... I am deeply committed to [a] right relationship with creation, in and beyond our faith community... I will be inviting the church to imagine new ways of caring for creation ... We are called to portray the integrity of creation.\" Speaking about the United Church's current struggles with declining membership and depleted financial resources, Tindal said, \"What's most important is to discern what's faithful, set a course, trust in God's abundance, and invite people into it.\" Tindal currently lives in Toronto, Ontario with her husband. She has two children, Chris, a candidate in the 2010 Toronto municipal election, and Alex, a comedy writer and performer."

  "text" : "Michael \"Mike\" Ertel (born November 29, 1969) is the Republican Supervisor of Elections of Seminole County, Florida, serving since he was appointed by Governor Jeb Bush in 2005. Ertel was born in Jacksonville, and grew up in Seminole County, attending Lake Howell High School and then later attending the University of Maryland University College. After high school, he joined the United States Army, where he served first in the Infantry and then as a public affairs representative, and took place in Army operations during the 1992 Los Angeles riots; during Operation Able Sentry, in which the United States established a base in Macedonia to monitor sanctions against Serbia; and in Bosnia during the Bosnian War. After completing his term in the Army, Ertel returned to Seminole County, where he continued his work in public affairs. In 1999, following a vacancy on the Oviedo City Council, Ertel applied for an appointment, but was ultimately not selected, in part due to concerns about a county employee being a city council member. Afterwards, he was contracted by Visit Florida, which was closely affiliated with the Florida Commission on Tourism, to work as their post-disaster public relations director. When Seminole County Supervisor of Elections Sandy Goard resigned from her office in January 2004, Dennis Joyner was appointed as her replacement. Ertel, along with fellow veteran Charles Gambaro, Jr., challenged Joyner in the Republican primary later that year. He criticized the incumbent for increased office spending, noting, \"When you spend beyond your means, then ask the county for more money, that tells me that the current administrator doesn't know how to budget,\" and declared that he would \"hold the line on the budget in his first year in office and then cut the budget in each of the succeeding three years.\" Ultimately, however, Ertel lost to Joyner in the primary. However, in 2005, following his election to the post, Joyner announced his resignation as Supervisor of Elections in a letter to then-Governor Jeb Bush, noting, \"My physicians have advised that I [resign] immediately,\" which was effective on January 10. Ertel, along with a number of other individuals, applied for the appointment to fill Joyner's position, and he was appointed by Governor Bush to serve a two-year term until the next general election. In 2006, Ertel ran for re-election, and was opposed by Democratic activist Marian Williams, who had run two years prior. He was endorsed by the Orlando Sentinel, which praised him for the fact that he \"has run elections well and has taken creative approaches to voter registration and streamlining of office operations.\" In the end, Ertel defeated Williams by a solid margin, winning 59% of the vote. In 2008 and 2012, Ertel was re-elected without opposition. In 2012, when Governor Rick Scott purged thousands of voters that he claimed to be non-citizens from the voter rolls, Ertel spoke out, asserting, \"It's frustrating that we're put in this situation that we are the ones having to contact our neighbors and say, 'Some other person's database says you may not be a citizen and we're the ones having to ask you if you are, even though we were the ones standing in the back of the room when we registered you to vote!'\" He noted that since there were so many instances in which the purged voters were actually legally eligible voters, \"[T]he list [of purged voters] should have been vetted quite a bit more before they were given to us.\" In 2013, Ertel received the International Electoral Ergonomy Award from the International Centre for Parliamentary Studies for his work as the Seminole County Supervisor of Elections; specifically, they praised him for the fact that the Voter Trust Plan he implemented increased voter confidence, increased turnout, and was \"exemplary for election management bodies worldwide.\""

He came to the New Haven Colony from England prior to 1637. He was a collector for Yale College in 1645. He served as an officer in the Cavalry Troop of Connecticut from 1650-66. In February 1652, Camfield sold his home lot in New Haven. That year, he moved to Norwalk, becoming one of the area's original settlers. He lived in Norwalk for fourteen years, becoming one of the settlement's and the colony's prominent citizens. He was a deputy of the Connecticut General Court from Norwalk in 1654. In 1662, he was a magistrate and judge for the court in Fairfield. He was one of the 19 signers of the Petition to King Charles II for the Charter of the Colony. In 1666, Matthew removed to Newark, Province of New Jersey along with Robert Treat, where he was one of the founders of that town. His home lot was located at about the present north-west corner of Washington and Market Streets. Apparent his departure from Norwalk is based upon some dissatisfaction with the union of the New Haven and Hartford colonies. Canfield Island in East Norwalk is named for him.

At 19, he became a foreman at the Pullman Palace Car Company, then known as the Wagner Palace Car Company, and took a job as a traveling salesman for the company. He then became a brewery solicitor, eventually becoming the highest paid brewery solicitor in Buffalo. He married Theresa M. Lauser on September 24, 1901. He opened a wholesale and retail liquor store at Broadway and Jefferson Avenue in 1912. He became president and general manager of the Mohawk Products Company; the merged Buffalo Brewing Company and the Cooperative Brewing Company formed during Prohibition to make near-beer. Schwab's rise in the Buffalo brewing industry was short lived because of the enactment of prohibition in 1919. Even though Schwab transitioned into the production of near beer he would take the opportunity to speak out against the Volstead Act whenever possible. \"By this time, Frank Schwab had developed a personal style that delighted his friends and infuriated his enemies\". The Buffalo Brewing company, Schwab's brewery, was raided by Federal agents who found illegal beer resulting in an indictment for Schwab. Schwab was an unlikely candidate for mayor. He had no political experience, he was Catholic, and under federal indictment for illegal possession of alcohol. But in 1921, as a joke the Knights of St. John circulated a petition on behalf of Schwab for his mayoral candidacy. He was elected Mayor on November 8, 1921, as the Republican candidate. During his term, in the summer of 1922, the last and most bitter street railway strike occurred; Schwab declared a transportation emergency and authorized the running of buses. Finally, the International Railway Company went open shop and the union was broken. In 1923–1924, the city purchased land for an airfield and, on September 27, 1926, Mayor Schwab laid the cornerstone of the administration building for the Buffalo Airport. Schwab was easily re-elected to a second term on November 4, 1925. He lost his bid for re-election on November 5, 1929, with Charles Roesch elected mayor. Schwab returned to active management of Mohawk Products Company. He died on April 23, 1946, and was buried in Mt. Calvary Cemetery."

The family moved to Buffalo in 1911, and when he was 10, Sedita began work by hawking newspapers and shining shoes around the downtown area. He attended Hutchinson Central High School and spent his summers working in canning factories and on farms in Wilson and Lyndonville, New York. He received a B.A. from Canisius College, and in 1931 received his law degree from the University of Buffalo Law School. He married Sarah Vacanti on July 11, 1934. In 1950, Sedita was elected as a City Court judge. He resigned from his job on the City Court bench on September 6, 1957 to pursue his mayoral bid. On November 5, 1957, he was elected mayor, defeating incumbent Steven Pankow. During this term, urban renewal was continued and the Ellicott District Project was completed. He lost his bid for re-election to mayor in the November 7, 1961 election, when Chester A. Kowal was elected mayor. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy nominated Sedita to the post of Federal Customs Collector for the Port of Buffalo; he held that post until May 7, 1965. He was elected as mayor to a second term on November 2, 1965. At the 1966 Democratic State Convention, held in Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, he was nominated to run for New York State Attorney General. He was defeated in the general election by Louis Lefkowitz. In June 1967, during the Buffalo riot at the Michigan Avenue YMCA, the mayor faced an angry crowd of young African Americans during an East Side street confrontation. He was re-elected on November 4, 1969. He ran for Erie County executive in 1971, but was defeated by Edward V. Regan in the general election. Because of health concerns, on February 8, 1973 Sedita submitted a letter of resignation to the Buffalo Common Council, to become effective on March 5, 1973. He died on May 2, 1975, aged 67, and was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery. On December 14, 1987, Buffalo Public School 38 was renamed Frank A. Sedita Community School. Sedita's son, Frank A.

  "text" : "Frank Hirao Ogawa (May 17, 1917 – July 13, 1994) was a civil rights leader and the first Japanese American to serve on the Oakland City Council in which he served from 1966 until his death in 1994. Upon his death, the Oakland City Council voted unanimously to rename City Hall Plaza in his honor as the Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. The plaza displays a bronze bust of Ogawa. A Nisei, Ogawa was born in Lodi, California and never lived in Japan. Nevertheless, as Japanese Americans, the U.S. government involuntarily relocated Ogawa's family members to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Millard County, Utah and they were detained there for the duration of World War II. Ogawa married Grace Ogawa (née Hiruma) prior to their wartime detention and they had two children—Alan and Nancy. Nancy was born in the Topaz War Relocation Center but died at age 2. After the war, Ogawa returned to Oakland where he found work as a gardener. Eventually, he borrowed and saved enough money to open his own nursery. When Ogawa died, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, in her Tribute to Frank H. Ogawa, said: \"Frank Ogawa was a remarkable person because he could take personal misfortune and turn it into a positive learning experience for himself and others. When Frank and Grace Ogawa were forced to sell their belongings and live in internment camps during World War II, they had to sleep on straw mattresses in horse stalls for six months before beingshipped to a camp in Utah to spend another 3 1/2 years in confinement. Despite this mistreatment and injustice, he never lost faith in the United States. Just the opposite--he strived to prove his loyalty to his country and became an internationally recognized champion of Asian-Americans in the process.\" She went on to say \"Having served five years on the Oakland Parks Commission, Frank Ogawa was elected to the city council in 1966, making him the first Japanese-American to hold a council seat in a major city in the continental United States. He held that position for 28 years until his passing -- the longest tenure in Oakland's history.\" Ogawa was a member of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) from 1972 to 1988, having been appointed to the Commission by the Association of Bay Area Governments. Ogawa served on the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Board of Directors from 1979 until 1992 when he had to retire from the Board because of health issues. He served as Chairman of the Board during most of 1987 and served as Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board's Executive Committee and Personnel Committee. Ogawa was a Republican. However, he never held nor was he ever a candidate for any partisan office. As a public official, Ogawa was known as kind, optimistic, and adept at building consensus. In about December 1988, Ogawa underwent successful heart surgery. Ogawa died in Oakland on July 13, 1994, of lung cancer. He was survived by his wife Grace, son Alan, and by two grandchildren, Courtney and Matthew. More than 600 people, including a representative of Oakland's sister city of Fukuoka, Japan, attended Ogawa's memorial service."

After the death of his father in 1891, Green relocated to Montreal to attend McGill University where he would obtain his medical degree.Upon his graduation from McGill in 1898, Green worked as a physician on the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway Crowsnest Pass line, in the Kootenay Valley, working on horseback. During the time he operated a hospital and treated many during an epidemic of typhoid. He later settled at Cranbrook, British Columbia, in the Kootenay Valley in 1899 to establish a medical practice. He was one of the first and only physicians, a medical pioneer at Cranbrook. A partnership with Dr. James Horace King of Cranbrook which started in 1903 was described as a \"cornerstone in local medicine\", with modern innovations being in use at the time, two examples being the first x-ray machine in the city being purchased for their hospital and the use of automobiles within the practice. In the British Columbia general election, 1941, Green was elected as a Conservative to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for the district of Cranbrook. He was elected again in 1945 as a coalition member, serving until his retirement in 1949. He married Lillian Barbara Staples of Stillwater, Minnesota in June 1905. One of his sons, William Otis Green also became a doctor in the Cranbrook area, with whom he later shared a practice with. Frank W. Green died in 1953 of heart problems at St. Eugene Hospital in Cranbrook, which he had established. He was later cremated in Calgary. His wife Lillian died on October 22, 1965 at Cranbrook. The F. W. Green Medical Centre and F. W. Green Memorial Home continuing care centre at Cranbrook are both named after him."

In 1872, he married Margaret Irwin while living in Franklin, Pennsylvania. They had two sons, William and Fred. Fred would also serve as mayor of Fort Pierce like his father. His father, Dr. William Fee moved to Melbourne in 1884, and Frank Fee moved to Melbourne from Franklin, in 1887. He opened a hardware store and mortuary named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Charles H. Stewart, who had also served as mayor. Fee was in the hardware business in Pennsylvania. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. He served as city alderman in Fort Pierce from 1904 to 1905, and as mayor from 1905 to 1907. Fee apparently had advanced views for his times. He opposed the death penalty and he supported compulsory education."

On 6 June 2016, he announced his resignation from Congress and decided to quit politics."

Popularly known as Ashai Sahib by his colleagues, political contemporaries and subordinates, Ghulam Ahmad Ashai was the first Kashmiri Muslim to attain a bachelor's degree. In reward for his service and academic achievements, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah appointed Ghulam Ahmad Ashai as the first Registrar of the University of Kashmir, both for academic and administrative matters, from 1948 to 1953. He led the first convocation of the University of Kashmir at Sher-e-Kashmir (Lion of Kashmir) Park and was followed by a distinguished panel including the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and the Pro-Indian Sheikh Abdullah. Ashai's involvement with Kashmir University started when he was appointed as the Special Officer assigned with the responsibility of starting Kashmir's first university. Ashai spent the next two years touring universities across India building up strategic ties and relations with renowned and established universities. In the 1980 Sheikh Abdullah's National Conference government, in recognition of Ashai’s contributions as founding registrar designated the main road leading to the present university campus in Hazratbal as Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road. A commemorative plaque was installed at the entrance of the university, but it has since been removed. The family claims that illegal orders were given to have the plaque removed and the road christening annulled. However, according to official papers, the road is still legally named as \"Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road\"."

  "text" : "Gam Malludora (1900–1969) was a tribal leader and Indian Parliamentarian. He was born in Chintapalle mandal of Visakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh, India. He was the younger brother of Gam Gantamdora. Their father was Gam Boggudora. The Gam brothers were close associates of Alluri Sitarama Raju during his tribal fights, attacking the police stations of Krishna Devi Peta, Addateegala and Annavaram and procuring ammunition for their assault missions. However, he was an alcoholic and womaniser. During these bouts, he provided secret information about their activities to the British. Hence, he was dismissed from the village by Raju. He took shelter in the house of his lover in 1923. During this time, the British arrested him and prosecuted him with the death sentence. On his appeal, the death sentence was changed in 1924 to life imprisonment at Andaman Jail. He was released in 1937 on the perusal of Congress politicians. In this way, he became the only associate of Raju to survive the British assault. He was elected to the 1st Lok Sabha from Visakhapatnam constituency in 1952 as Independent candidate along with Lanka Sundaram."

In 1808 the Pitcairn colony was discovered and the elder Adams was granted amnesty for his part in the mutiny. Both of Adams' parents died in March 1829, when George was 24 years old. Adams served as Chief Magistrate on Pitcairn in 1848. Adams was an opponent of Joshua Hill, and he opposed the decision to move to Norfolk Island, due to his granddaughter being ill.

Wriedt is the daughter of former state Labor leader and Whitlam Government Minister for Agriculture Ken Wriedt. Wriedt was appointed Minister for Education in 1998, becoming the youngest ever female member of Cabinet in Tasmania. As Education Minister, in December 2000, she launched \"Learning Together\", a major policy on education, training and information provision for the state of Tasmania. Learning Together promised a complete overhaul of the state's education system, introducing the Essential Learnings Curriculum as a trial way to assess and teach students. Wriedt also funded the establishment of a number of child care centres co-located with government primary schools, and saw the raising of Tasmania's school leaving age from 16 to 17 years. In 2002 she also became Minister for Women. In 2005, Wriedt initiated the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women to recognise the significant contribution that women have made to Tasmania throughout history. In the 2006 Tasmanian state election Wriedt suffered a decline in her primary vote, almost losing her seat to Liberal challenger Vanessa Goodwin, after criticism of the government over the Essential Learnings Curriculum. After the election, she became Minister for Tourism, Arts and the Environment, while David Bartlett assumed her Education portfolio. Following a cabinet reshuffle in January 2008, Wriedt was appointed Minister for Economic Development and Tourism."

In 2006, he was appointed as an interim councillor in ward 41, and was then elected as the councillor for Ward 43 in Scarborough East. On February 1, 2006, City Council appointed Ainslie to fill the vacancy in Ward 41 that was created when Bas Balkissoon was elected in a provincial by-election in the riding of Scarborough-Rouge River. A condition of the appointment was that he would not run as a candidate in the 2006 election. However, when councillor David Soknacki announced his intention not to run in Ward 43, Ainslie put his name forward as a candidate to replace him. Ainslie used to be an executive assistant to Soknacki. Soknacki supported Ainslie's candidacy. During the election campaign in 2006, a video surfaced which showed Ainslie promising to Toronto City Council not to run. \"I will not run in Ward 41, or any other ward in the city.\" His campaign literature urged voters to \"return\" him to city hall. He said that his campaign team suggested using the word \"re-elect\". Ainslie said, \"I didn't think it was proper.\" Despite the controversy, he elected in Ward 43. In April 2007, he determined that it costs $20,000 annually to provide councillors and staff at City Hall offices with free coffee every day. He moved a motion in committee to remove the expense, but it failed to pass. During the Rob Ford drug allegation scandal, Ainslie was removed as chair from the city's government management committee and appointed as chair of the parks and environment committee. On October 11, 2013 he resigned from the mayor's executive committee and his role as chair of the parks and environment committee over differences with Ford's longterm strategic direction for the city. On May 3, 2013, Ainslie was stopped by a RIDE check on Kingston Road and was given a three-day licence suspension."

Born in Lismore in Northern New South Wales to a prominent political family and educated at Lismore High School, Morton left school at fourteen to be employed in a legal firm, before branching out into various businesses. Moving to Sydney, Morton first entered politics in 1944 as an Alderman on Mosman Municipal Council, rising to be Mayor in 1946. Morton then entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 3 May 1947, representing the Electoral district of Mosman for the Liberal Party of Australia. Morton soon rose through the party ranks, becoming touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested the leadership in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton then stood, but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take the leadership. Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected to succeed him as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition. Morton contested as Leader the 1956 and 1959 elections, gaining seats each time but failing to defeat the long-standing Labor Government. A few months after the 1959 election, Morton was deposed as Leader by now-Deputy Leader Askin in July 1959. He remained on the backbenches until Askin led the Liberal Party to its first electoral victory in May 1965, whereupon Morton was appointed as the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Highways. He served in the cabinet, becoming prominent and controversial in his role in the reorganisation of the City of Sydney as Local Government Minister and state planning regulations, until he retired from parliament in June 1972. He died in Mosman aged 88 in 1999."

  "text" : "Peter Dawson (April 11, 1892 – March 24, 1963) was a Canadian minister, politician and member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Dawson was born in 1892 in Scotland. After attending schools and briefly working as a labourer and an apprentice to a butcher in Maybole, Dawson immigrated to Canada at the age of 18 with his brother, James Dawson. Shortly after arriving, he took up residence in Ontario where he worked in the automobile profession for 7 years until moving west to Alberta in 1918. Following his decision to settle in Calgary, he found employment as a butcher and interest in missionary work. His residence in Calgary, however, didn't last long, as 5 years later, he moved to the nearby capital city of Edmonton, where he attended Prebysterian schooling. Ordained as a minister of the United Church in 1927, he soon was called in 1928 to Sedgewick, where he remained for two years, before getting called to Champion. Although not intending to have a career in politics, a group of citizens persuaded him to run in the 1935 election, in which he defeated United Farmers Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Oran McPherson by 66% of the vote. In 1937, Dawson was appointed Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. During his 26-year tenure, from 1937 until his death in 1963, he witnessed and presided over many events, such as the first instance of crossing the floor in Alberta and naming a fellow MLA for remarks made at a provincial official. He also witnessed 2 royal visits to Alberta from two different monarchs, King George IV in 1939, and Queen Elizabeth II 20 years later, in which he presided over the installation of a fountain in the Legislature's rotunda. After dying in office in 1963, Dawson was honoured with a state funeral, attended by many prominent citizens of Alberta."

  "text" : "Albert Charles Weed II is a Virginia winemaker, businessman, and Democrat. Weed was the Democratic nominee for election to Virginia's Fifth Congressional District seat, in both 2004 and 2006, running against Republican incumbent Virgil Goode. In 2004, Weed lost 64% to 36%; Goode once again defeated Weed in 2006, 59% to 40%. Weed, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces Command Sergeant Major and veteran of the Vietnam War, has a B.A. from Yale University and M.P.A. from Princeton University. After working for the World Bank and in the private sector, he purchased a farm where he established a commercial vineyard and co-founded the Virginia Wineries Association. In 2002, Governor Mark Warner named Weed 5th District Trustee for the Virginia Land Conservation Trust Fund. In 2006, Weed faced competition for the Democratic Party nomination. Former Roanoke City Manager Bern Ewert argued that Weed had been beaten \"like a drum\" in 2004 and would probably lose again. Nevertheless, on May 20, 2006, Weed was chosen as the Democratic nominee by a 114-73 vote of the delegates to the party convention. In Weed's 2006 campaign, he emphasized the need for better treatment of military veterans. One of his campaign proposals was to establish a college for disabled veterans in the district. In both his campaigns, he advocated withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq."

It was Pillsbury who drafted the bylaws of the NAACP. In 1913, he resigned his membership in the American Bar Association when that organization rejected the membership of William H. Lewis, a black assistant U.S. attorney and supporter of Booker T. Washington. In 1913, Pillsbury was awarded an honorary LL.D. degree from Howard University.

He was also elected to the Council. The quota was 840. In 2003, Brolly took over from George Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) as the Mayor of Limavady. At Christmas 2003 she was asked to switch on the Christmas tree lights for Burnfoot. There was a small Loyalist protest during the switching-on of the lights because of the election of a Sinn Féin mayor. Afterwards, the tree was cut down by vandals and the lights smashed. On 14 June 2004 Councillor Brolly stood down as Mayor. In October 2004, the High Court of Northern Ireland ordered the government to provide the Brolly couple with protection, following reports of threats from the Red Hand Defenders, a Loyalist paramilitary group. In 2005, she was re-elected to the Council, but this time for the Limavady Town electoral area. She garnered 657 first preference votes, a total of 17.6% of the vote. She was the only Sinn Féin councillor elected in that area, coming third behind George Robinson and Alan Robinson both of the DUP. In January 2008, Brolly and another councillor were confronted by a crowd in an \"extremely nasty mood\" outside the council's offices. Police were called."

He spent time in southern and eastern Africa as a miner and prospector before returning to Australia to farm. In 1966, he became New South Wales State Chairman of the Young Australian Country Party, holding the position until 1968 when he was appointed to the state council, serving until 1984. He was elected to Carrathool Shire Council in 1970 and remained until 1974. He was chairman of the Rankins Springs branch of the party from 1972 to 1984. In 1984, Cruickshank was selected as the National candidate for the state seat of Murrumbidgee, which was being vacated by sitting Labor member Lin Gordon. Cruickshank finished third on the primary votes behind Labor candidate Margaret Delves and independent Thomas Marriott, but with Liberal preferences pushed into second place and was elected the victor on Marriott's preferences, with a margin of 51.52%. Partly due to redistributions which greatly strengthened the National Party in Murrumbidgee, Cruickshank faced no further serious challenges and was re-elected in 1988, 1991, and 1995. He retired in 1999 and was succeeded as National MP for the seat by Adrian Piccoli. On 21 May 2010, Cruickshank died at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital from pneumonia."

Cachalia was born Amina Asvat in Vereeniging, South Africa, on 28 June 1930.  She began campaigning against Apartheid and racial discrimination as a teenager. She became a women's rights activist, often focusing on economic issues, such as financial independence for women. Amina and Yusuf Cachalia were friends of Nelson Mandela before his imprisonment at Robben Island in 1962. She became a staunch anti-apartheid activist. She spent fifteen years under house arrest throughout the 1960s and 1970s. She was the treasurer of the Federation of South African Women (Fedsaw), a leading supporter of the Federation of Transvaal Women, and a member of both the Transvaal Indian Youth Congress and Transvaal Indian Congress during the Apartheid era. In 1995 Mandela asked Cachalia to marry him. At the time his was separated from his current wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Cachalia turned down Mandela's proposal because she said that \"I'm my own person and that I had just recently lost my husband whom I had enormous regard for\". Mandela divorced Madikizela-Mandela a year later and married Graça Machel in 1998. Cachalia was elected as an MP to the National Assembly of South Africa in the 1994 South African general election, the country's first with universal adult suffrage. In 2004, she was awarded the Order of Luthuli in Bronze for her contributions to gender and racial equality and democracy. In March 2013, 37 days after her death, her autobiography When Hope and History Rhyme was published."

  "text" : "Andreas Ziartides (Greek: Ανδρέας Ζιαρτίδης; 1919–1997) was a Cypriot trade unionist and politician. He was a Member of Parliament from 1960 to 1991, being elected as a candidate of the left wing AKEL party. He was Secretary General of the Pancyprian Federation of Labour (PEO) from 1943 to 1986. His contribution to the development of labour relations and labour legislation in Cyprus has been crucial and many consider him the person with the most significant role in shaping the trade union movement on the island. Legislations such as the Social Security Law of Cyprus in 1956 (Πρώτος Νόμος Περί Κοινωνικών Ασφαλίσεων, Νόμος Αρ. 31 του 1956), the introduction of the Cost of Living Allowance, the eight-hour working day and the forty hour working week, legislation on unfair dismissal and the labour disputes tribunals, the shaping of the collective agreements in many sectors of economic activity as well as the tripartite cooperation between trade unions, employers’ organisations and government all bear his mark. He first joined the outlawed Communist Party of Cyprus in 1939 and became a member of left wing AKEL party in 1941 upon its foundation.He was Secretary General of the Pancyprian Trade Union Committee, the first coordinating body of trade unions in Cyprus and the precursor of PEO. He was accused along with all the Committee members for sedition and insurrection against the Colonial order and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment in 1946. This was a major political trial of the colonial era and his address to the court was a memorable anti-colonial statement. Andreas Ziartides participated as the Cypriot representative in the founding congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) held in 1945 in London. He served on the General Council and the Executive Committee of the WFTU for many years and was its Vice President for a while. In the early nineties he, along with others in the AKEL leadership, disagreed with the line followed by the Party and was dismissed from his leadership position. This led to his and others’ departure from AKEL and the formation of ADESOK, in Greek: ΑΔΗΣΟΚ (Ανανεωτικό Δημοκρατικό Σοσιαλιστικό Κόμμα), a reformist leftist party. ADESOK was later merged with Free Democrats Movement (founded by former President of Cyprus George Vassiliou) and formed a new party named United Democrats. A form of interview/biography of Andreas Ziartides was authored by Panikos Paionides in his book \"Ανδρέας Ζιαρτίδης: Χωρίς φόβο και πάθος\" Television interviews of Andreas Ziartides were documented by journalist Pavlos Pavlou (Greek: Παύλος Παύλου) in his book Dimosia Katathesi (Greek: Δημόσια Κατάθεση)."

  "text" : "Andrew P. Canova (October 30, 1835 – December 17, 1909) was a Florida settler and author of Life and Adventures in South Florida. He was a veteran of the Third Seminole War. In Fall of 1858, he moved from Tampa Bay to Brevard County where he settled on the Sebastian River. He lived in a palm thatch hut near the mouth of the river. He, along with Ed Marr, hunted, fished and raised onions in a small garden. He started to cultivate citrus, but was impatient and abandoned that project. Canova went to St. Augustine to enlist in the Confederate Army in 1861. In 1885 he wrote Life and Adventures in South Florida, in which he lamented the demise of wildlife in the Indian River area."
