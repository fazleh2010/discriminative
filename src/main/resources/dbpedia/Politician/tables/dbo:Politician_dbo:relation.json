  "text" : "William Thorne Buckland (1819 – 17 January 1876) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament in New Zealand. Buckland was born in 1819 or 1820. His mother was Elizabeth (née Mortimore) and his father was the broker John Buckland; they were from Devon, England. The auctioneer Alfred Buckland was a younger brother. Buckland arrived in New Zealand in 1841 from South Australia, and was a butcher in Auckland, then a farmer in the Waikato. He married Susan Channing on 13 April 1843 at St Paul's Church in Auckland. Buckland was appointed to the Auckland Executive Council of the Auckland Province in November 1856 (the source does not state and end date), and was again appointed from February to July 1857. He was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council for the Raglan electorate in November 1861 and served until 1869. From 1869 to 1873, he represented the Franklin electorate. He had no intention of standing for the Provincial Council again but happened to ride past the nomination meeting in Newmarket for the Eden electorate. There was only one nomination thus far for the two available positions, and Buckland was talked into being nominated. As the number of nominations matched the number of available positions, he was declared elected unopposed, and served until his death. He represented two South Auckland electorates; first the Raglan electorate from 1865 to 1866, when he retired. He then represented the Franklin electorate from 1871 to 1875. He was nominated for the 1876 election and gave a speech at the nomination meeting on 10 January 1876, but withdrew his nomination before the end of the proceedings. The Auckland Star suggested that the sole purpose of his nomination was that he could make a speech in opposition to Sir George Grey. Buckland left for the Waikato immediately afterwards to support Alfred Cox in his candidacy in the Waipa electorate. However, he became ill with symptoms of heat stroke and returned to his home in Remuera. He died at his home in Remuera, Auckland aged 56 years after that brief illness. He was buried at St Stephen's Cemetery in Parnell. His wife had died in September 1871; she had committed suicide after having become depressed. Their sons Frank and John Channing Buckland were both elected to the parliament in the 1884 election. Jessie Buckland was his son John's daughter."

  "text" : "Captain Charles Calvert (1688 – February 2, 1734) was the 14th Proprietary Governor of Maryland in 1720, at a time when the Calvert family had recently regained control of their proprietary colony. He was appointed governor by his cousin Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, who in 1721 came into his inheritance. Calvert worked to reassert the Proprietary interest against the privileges of the colonists as set out in the Maryland Charter, and to ease tensions between the Lords Baltimore and their subjects. Religious tension, which had been a source of great division in the colony, was much reduced under his governorship. Captain Calvert was replaced as governor in 1727 by his cousin Benedict Leonard Calvert, though he continued to occupy other colonial offices. He suffered from early senility and died in 1734."

His mother's identity is not known, though one source suggests Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham. As he was illegitimate, he was not able to inherit his father's title or estates, which passed instead to his half brother Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (1731–1771). Benedict Calvert spent most of his life as a politician and planter in Maryland, though Frederick, by contrast, never visited the colony. Calvert became wealthy through proprietarial patronage and became an important colonial official, but he would lose his offices and his political power, though not his land and wealth, during the American Revolution."

Pennington, a member of the Whig Party, became the first speaker of the Indiana territorial legislature's lower house in 1810, served as the territory's census enumerator in 1815, and represented Harrison County as one of its five delegates to the constitutional convention of 1816. Pennington was the first speaker of the Indiana Senate (1816 to 1818), and served in the state legislature for eighteen years, which included five years in the Indiana House of Representatives and thirteen years in the Indiana Senate. His major political contributions relate to his strong opposition to slavery. Pennington ran unsuccessfully for Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1825. In addition to his service in the state legislature, Penning was a Harrison County sheriff and a justice of the peace, a trustee of Indiana University, and a member of the Grand Lodge of Indiana. He also supervised construction of the limestone courthouse that served as Indiana's first state capitol building in Corydon, Indiana. The historic Old Capitol, the seat of state government from 1816 to 1825, is one of his most enduring legacies. Fondly remembered as \"Old Uncle Dennis\" or \"Father Pennington,\" he was known for his common sense and strong character and became one of Harrison County's most influential citizens."

The son of Ngāi Tahu leader Te Matenga Taiaroa and Mawera Taiaroa, he was born at Otakau on the Otago Peninsula in the 1830s or early 1840s. He represented the Southern Maori electorate from 1871 to February 1879, when he appointed to the Legislative Council. He was disqualified from the Legislative Council in August 1880 over a technicality, which caused bitterness and resentment among Māori. In 1881 Ihaia Tainui who had held the electorate since 1879 resigned so that Taiaroa could resume the electorate. Taiaroa then held the electorate from 1881 to 1885 when he was again appointed to the Legislative Council, where he served for 20 years until his death. Taiaroa was active in pursuing Ngāi Tahu land claims in Parliament. Taiaroa's son John Taiaroa played all for the All Blacks in their 1884 tour of New South Wales and went on to work as a lawyer in Hastings."

Knuth was born in the Queensland town of Tully. His brother Jeff Knuth is a former One Nation parliamentarian. Shane Knuth entered the state's parliament as the member for Charters Towers at the 2004 state election by defeating incumbent MP Christine Scott of the Labor Party. At the 2006 state election, Knuth was re-elected; but the redistribution ahead of the 2009 state election combined his district with that of One Nation MP Rosa Lee Long. From this contest, Knuth emerged the victor. He became, as a consequence, the inaugural member for the district of Dalrymple. On 30 October 2011, Shane Knuth resigned from the Liberal National Party to join Katter's Australian Party."

A self-described moderate Republican, Stan served in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly, including a successful run for the Oregon House of Representatives while in law school in 1972. Later he served as Oregon Superintendent of Public Instruction from 1999 to 2003, in a political career spanning four decades. In non-elective offices, he was chairman of the state's ethics commission and on the Oregon Traffic Safety Commission between stints in the legislature. Bunn also made unsuccessful attempts to be elected as Oregon Attorney General in 1976 and to serve in Congress representing Oregon’s first congressional district in 1996, when his brother was running for re-election in the neighboring Congressional district. Bunn faced scrutiny over back taxes while Superintendent of Public Instruction and also was accused of committing over one thousand ethics violations by the Oregon Government Ethics Commission, stemming primarily from the use of a state car and use of a state cell phone for personal use. Bunn challenged their findings and later reached a settlement in which he did not admit wrongdoing and paid $25,000 to the Commission in a payment that could not be called a fine."

After working several years as a Solicitor, Robson stood for, and was elected to, parliament on 29 August 1936 at a by-election for the seat of Vaucluse. He served many years on the backbenches, he enlisted in the Second World War and served with distinction during the war, gaining promotion to lieutenant colonel and receiving the Distinguished Service Order for his service. Returning to politics, he had missed the foundation of the Liberal Party of Australia in 1945. When long-time Leader Vernon Treatt resigned the leadership in 1954 and contests between Deputy Leader Robert Askin and Pat Morton became deadlocked he was asked to stand and was consequently elected as party leader and Leader of the Opposition. He served little more than a year before he was deposed by Pat Morton. In 1957 he retired from politics and returned to his legal career before retiring. He died of a heart attack in August 1974."

Appointed to the Canadian Senate representing the Province of Quebec in 1907 at age 80, Dessaulles served for 23 years before dying at age 102. Dessaulles was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Lower Canada in 1827, the son of Jean Dessaulles and a nephew of Louis-Joseph Papineau. Before becoming senator, Dessaulles was president of the Bank of Saint-Hyacinthe, and mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe. He also represented Saint-Hyacinthe in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1897 to 1900. He was a last-minute candidate for the provincial seat, having been nominated after the death of the previous candidate, his son-in-law Maurice St-Jacques. In 1857, he had married Émilie-Emma, the daughter of judge Dominique Mondelet; in 1869, he married Louise-Frances Leman after the death of his first wife. His 100th birthday was marked as a historic moment in the senate, because Dessaulles had become only the second sitting senator to reach the age of 100 (the other being David Wark). At his death in 1930, Dessaulles was the oldest sitting politician in the world. To date, no one has beaten this record. Dessaulles is also renowned for only having spoken twice while serving as a Senator. Once to deny that his appointment was part of a corrupt bargain, and a second time to thank his fellow senators for his portrait, on his 100th birthday. His daughter Henriette Dessaulles became a noted writer and journalist."

  "text" : "George Hume Steuart, (1700–1784) was a Scottish physician, tobacco planter, and Loyalist politician in colonial Maryland. Born in Perthshire, Steuart emigrated to Maryland in around 1721, where he benefited from proprietarial patronage and was appointed to a number of colonial offices, eventually becoming a wealthy landowner with estates in both Maryland and Scotland. However, he was forced by the outbreak of the American Revolution to decide whether to remain loyal to the Crown or to throw in his lot with the American rebels. In 1775 Steuart sailed to Scotland, deciding at age 75 that \"he could not turn rebel in his old age\". He remained there until his death in 1784."

Born in Lismore in Northern New South Wales to a prominent political family and educated at Lismore High School, Morton left school at fourteen to be employed in a legal firm, before branching out into various businesses. Moving to Sydney, Morton first entered politics in 1944 as an Alderman on Mosman Municipal Council, rising to be Mayor in 1946. Morton then entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 3 May 1947, representing the Electoral district of Mosman for the Liberal Party of Australia. Morton soon rose through the party ranks, becoming touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested the leadership in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton then stood, but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take the leadership. Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected to succeed him as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition. Morton contested as Leader the 1956 and 1959 elections, gaining seats each time but failing to defeat the long-standing Labor Government. A few months after the 1959 election, Morton was deposed as Leader by now-Deputy Leader Askin in July 1959. He remained on the backbenches until Askin led the Liberal Party to its first electoral victory in May 1965, whereupon Morton was appointed as the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Highways. He served in the cabinet, becoming prominent and controversial in his role in the reorganisation of the City of Sydney as Local Government Minister and state planning regulations, until he retired from parliament in June 1972. He died in Mosman aged 88 in 1999."
