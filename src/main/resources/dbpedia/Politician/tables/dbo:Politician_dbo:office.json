Originally elected as a member of the Australian Labor Party, Hanna joined the SA Greens in 2003 before becoming an independent member in 2006. Before entering Parliament, Hanna practised law. He also served as a Councillor for the City of Marion from 1995 to 1997. He returned to practicing law in 2010 and, in 2014 was elected unopposed as Mayor of the City of Marion. Hanna is currently on the Board of Victim Support Service, and is Patron of numerous local sporting clubs. He was the longest-serving member of the Seaview High School Governing Council and had been President of Friends of Glenthorne and the Reynella Business & Tourism Association. While initially elected at the 1997 and 2002 elections as a member of the Labor Party, he moved to the Greens in early 2003. He ultimately resigned from the Greens on 8 February 2006 and ran in the 2006 election as an independent and won. His chances of retaining his seat in 2006 had been essentially written off by most commentators after his decision to become an Independent MP, but he won a narrow victory after a very low Liberal primary vote and an endorsement from popular Independent MP Nick Xenophon. He narrowly lost at the 2010 election despite an improved vote, due to finishing third after all non-major party preferences had been distributed. Hanna sought to have his 2010 election loss overturned by the Supreme Court of South Australia, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, saying he fell victim to \"misleading and defamatory\" leaflets and posters distributed by the Labor Party. The court ruled the leaflets - labelling Hanna \"soft on crime\" - were defamatory and not factual, yet there was a right to express such opinions. The court dismissed Hanna's case. Hanna unsuccessfully re-contested the seat of Mitchell at the 2014 election. Some of the local issues Hanna was known to campaign for were: upgrading the Oaklands rail crossing, making Glenthorne a forested recreational park, and turning the old O’Halloran Hill TAFE site into a high school."

He went to school in Toronto and attended North Toronto Collegiate Institute and University of Toronto Schools. He went to the University of Toronto and graduated from the Faculty of Law. He practised with Blake, Cassels & Graydon before starting his own firm in 1968. After several years of practice at Houser Henry Loudon and Syron, Jaffary joined Gowlings in 1992 before continuing his municipal planning law practice as a sole practitioner near the turn of the century. Jaffary was active with the federal New Democratic Party and served as vice-president from 1969 to 1973. Jaffary became active in local politics in 1968 when he became president of the Ward 2 Residents' Association in the Cabbagetown area. The association fought the city's plans to tear down housing for urban renewal. In the 1960s, Cabbagetown was a run down area of town. Since then many of the houses have been renovated and the neighbourhood is now gentrified and upscale. Jaffary ran for Toronto City Council and became alderman for Ward 7 in 1969. As senior alderman, he sat on both the city and Metro Toronto councils. He was re-elected in 1972 but decided not to run in the 1974 election. During his tenure, he was active in the reform wing of city council along with John Sewell. He was interested in civic organization and administration and became involved in city housing policy."

He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 2006 until 2012, representing the electorate of Stuart. He served as Minister for Environment, Regional Development, Sport and Recreation, Central Australia and Information, Communications and Technology Policy in the Henderson government. Hampton was elected in a 2006 by-election following the resignation of Peter Toyne, and was easily re-elected in 2008. He was widely expected to cruise to re-election in 2012 as well, However, he was defeated by his aunt, Country Liberal Party candidate Bess Price, as part of Labor's collapse in the remote seats at that election. Hampton saw his primary vote more than halved, and ultimately lost to Price on a two-party swing of 18.6 percent."

He was also the deputy mayor of Toronto, succeeding Doug Holyday in 2013 after the latter resigned from Council to contest a by-election for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Following the controversy surrounding Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's admitted substance abuse and further allegations of inappropriate conduct, the Toronto City Council voted on November 15, 2013 and November 18, 2013 to remove the non-statutory mayoral powers from Ford and grant them to Kelly for the remainder of Ford's term. On May 1, 2014, Kelly took over the remainder of Ford's duties when Ford entered drug rehabilitation and started a leave of absence from Toronto City Council. These powers were returned when Ford returned to his job on July 1. Even though Kelly had all the powers of the mayoral office for 3 months, Ford still technically held the title of Mayor, while Kelly was still referred to as the Deputy Mayor."

While his party formed a majority government in the 39th Parliament, Letnick was not initially included in the cabinet but was appointed to several committees, including the Select Standing Committee on Health where he was chair and tasked to report on the impacts of baby boomers and alternative strategies on the health care system. As a private member Letnick also introduced one piece of legislation, the Emergency Intervention Disclosure Act, which was adopted by government. This was the first time in six years that a private member was successful in introducing and getting legislation passed in the legislature. Prior to his election to the legislature, he was a business professor at the Okanagan School of Business. He graduated from Heriot-Watt University with a Master of Business Administration and achieved candidacy status toward a Doctorate in Health Economics with the University of British Columbia before setting the PhD aside to focus on his public duties as minister of agriculture. He served as a municipal councillor in the Town of Banff in the 1990s and in the City of Kelowna between 2005 and 2009."

Following the 2011 BC Liberal leadership election, in which Yamamoto endorsed George Abbott, the new Premier, Christy Clark, promoted Yamamoto to Minister of Advanced Education. Yamamoto has introduced one piece of legislation, the Advanced Education Statutes Amendment Act, 2011, which sought to implement several measures, including expanding the Personal Education Number system which tracks students in the BC educational system to also include private educational institutions, specifying that board members of colleges and universities are to act in the best interests of the institution, and updating the Architectural Institute of BC's dispute resolution process. The bill was introduced on November 3, 2011, but was not adopted before the winter break. Prior to her election to the legislature, Yamamoto owned and operated a business that started as a specialty shop for laser printing but evolved to focus on design and had created props for the television and film industry. She spent time on the governing boards of Capilano College, the North Shore Credit Union, the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, and the Gordon and Marion Smith Foundation. She completed one term as president of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce and worked as the president and general manager of the North Vancouver Chamber of Commerce from 2007 until she was elected as MLA."

Nasarudin Hashim (born 20 July 1950) is a Malaysian politician. A member of the Perak State Legislative Assembly, he is known for his key role in the constitutional crisis in the state in 2009. His defection from the People's Justice Party (PKR) to the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO)—days after he had defected the other way—helped cause the collapse of the Pakatan Rakyat government of which PKR was a component party. Nasarudin was first elected to the assembly in 2004, as an UMNO member representing the seat of Parit. He was re-elected to the assembly in 2008, albeit for a different seat, Bota. In the 2008 election, the Pakatan Rakyat coalition took power in Perak, consigning Nasarudin's UMNO to opposition for the first time in the state's history. On 25 January 2009, Nasarudin announced his defection to PKR, thus boosting the Pakatan Rakyat's narrow majority in the assembly. He claimed it was a \"brave\" decision that had the support of his constituents. His move was followed by the defection of eight UMNO branches in his constituency. However, in early February, Nasarudin defected back to UMNO. Joined by three other Pakatan Rakyat MPs, the defection gave the UMNO-led Barisan Nasional coalition the numbers to return to government. Nasarudin said his reversal was to ensure the \"stability\" of government in Perak."

  "text" : "Joy K. MacPhail (born March 6, 1952) is a former Canadian politician in British Columbia. A longtime member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party, she served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from 1991 to 2005 and as a Minister of the Crown from 1993–1999, and 2000-2001. MacPhail was born in Hamilton, Ontario, but has lived in Vancouver for almost three decades. She studied economics at the University of Western Ontario, and later earned a degree in labour studies at the London School of Economics. She has one son. MacPhail was first elected to the British Columbia Legislature in 1991 as the MLA for Vancouver-Hastings, and served in the cabinets of three NDP premiers. Under Premier Mike Harcourt, she served as Minister of Social Services from 1993 to 1996. Under Premier Glen Clark she served a short stint as Minister of Social Services, then as Minister of Health from 1996 to 1998. MacPhail's final cabinet position in the Clark government was as Minister of Finance from 1998 to 1999, when she quit the Clark government at a time when it was suffering from increasing dissent and scandal. When Clark eventually quit the NDP leadership, MacPhail ran for NDP leader, but did not attract significant legislative caucus support. She withdrew when it became obvious that Ujjal Dosanjh had an insurmountable lead. Under Dosanjh, she was the Deputy Premier and served as Minister of Labour and later, Minister of Education. The NDP suffered a massive electoral blow in the May 16, 2001 provincial election, winning only two seats—those of MacPhail and Environment Minister Jenny Kwan. MacPhail only held onto her seat by 409 votes. Exactly one month after the election, MacPhail was appointed as the party's interim leader. She was a harsh critic of the new BC Liberal Premier Gordon Campbell. Although the NDP was the only other party in the legislature, it was four seats short of official party status. Despite this, Assembly Speaker Claude Richmond ensured that the NDP was resourced as an opposition and she was recognized by the Speaker as the Leader of the Opposition. MacPhail stepped down as leader in 2003 and was succeeded by Carole James. She remained as parliamentary leader of the NDP until her retirement from politics after the 2005 election. Following her departure from politics, MacPhail married film and television producer James Shavick, and is currently a partner in his production firm Shavick Entertainment. She is a member of the board of OutTV, a Canadian cable television station owned by Shavick Entertainment, and focused on the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities. She has also appeared as a member of political panels on As It Happens on CBC Radio."

She first entered politics in 1997 when she was elected to Nepean city council. With the creation of the new amalgamated city of Ottawa in 2000, Harder ran against regional councillor Molly McGoldrick-Larsen. While the race was expected to be close, Harder ended up winning by several thousand votes. She was reelected in the 2003 Ottawa election, by defeating newcomer John R. Palmer. One of her first efforts on city council was the successful campaign to replace the new coat of arms with that of the old city of Ottawa. She also led a campaign to have filters installed on computers in the public libraries that would keep users from accessing pornography. In the November 2006 municipal elections, Harder retained her position as councillor with 75% of the vote in Barrhaven Ward. Harder was criticized for the appearance of a conflict of interest for having accepted a free corporate box seat at the 2007 Stanley Cup NHL hockey playoff game (Senators v.s. Anaheim Ducks) at Scotiabank Place from Waste Management Services—a company that the City does business with. She was accused of conflict of interest again in 2008 for allegedly endorsing a waste management company, Plasco, and accepting money in the form of a paid trip Harder is heavily active in Conservative politics and in the past mused about running federally in her riding. Her daughter, Elena ran for the vacant Orléans Ward seat in a by-election in January 2006, but was unsuccessful."

  "text" : "Jacquelin Holzman (born c. 1936) served as mayor of Ottawa, Canada, from 1991 to 1997. Never attending university, she married at age nineteen and started a family. She became a volunteer, especially on causes relating to the disabled. She was elected to Ottawa city council in 1982 representing the Richmond Ward (now Bay Ward), defeating future mayor Bob Chiarelli, and became one of the more right-leaning city councillors. Acclaimed in the 1985 election, she soon ran into controversy in her second term over an expansion to the Carlingwood Shopping Centre. Holzman supported the expansion but many of her constituents were opposed. In the 1988 Ottawa election, she faced a strong challenge from Alex Cullen but was re-elected with a solid majority. She was a close ally of mayor Jim Durrell and was described as his heir apparent. When he chose not to run for re-election, Holzman ran against left-leaning councillor Nancy Smith. Holzman ran on a pro-development and tax cut platform and defeated Smith and interim mayor Marc Laviolette. During her first term, she worked for the 'Yes' side in the Charlottetown Accord referendum. She worked hard to increase Ottawa's international status. In 1993 she represented Ottawa in Tokyo at the Third Capitals of the World Conference. In the same month, she led a trade mission to Taiwan to promote Taiwanese investment and tourism in Ottawa. During her term, she was a strong supporter of Taiwan establishing an office in Ottawa. In the 1994 mayoral election she faced a number of challengers. She was accused of arrogance for planning an expedition to China under the assumption she would win re-election. Her second term was also mostly uneventful. One major debate was over the mayor's desire to add an expensive unity tower to the new city hall. The tower was left unfinished, as it remains today. In November 1996 she announced that she would not run for re-election, citing the desire to spend more time with her family. She was expected to face a difficult election against city councillor Jim Watson. After leaving the mayor's office, she became head of the Ottawa Congress Centre. The next year she was diagnosed with breast cancer, but was treated successfully, and became an advocate for breast cancer related causes. In 2002 she became chair of the Ottawa Health Research Institute. She remained head of the Congress Centre before retiring in 2004. In 2007 she was appointed to the board of the National Capital Commission."

These allegations became public after West became a target of a sting operation conducted by his hometown newspaper, the Spokesman Review.

West admitted engaging in homosexual behavior with adults, despite an earlier record of supporting \"anti-gay\" legislation. Though never charged, he was removed from office by recall in 2005. The Federal Bureau of Investigation eventually closed its investigation and took no action for lack of evidence."

Dubbed \"Stalin's Granny\" owing to her left-wing views, Maynard was a leading activist in the National Union of Agricultural Workers becoming vice-president of the union and being narrowly beaten to its presidency. She joined the Labour Party in 1946 and served as a councillor on North Yorkshire County Council. She was elected to Labour's National Executive Committee 1972–82 and 1983–87, and was Vice-Chair of the Labour Party 1980–81. She was appointed a Justice of the Peace at Thirsk in 1950. Having acted as Labour agent in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, Maynard was elected in 1974 as MP for Sheffield Brightside and held the seat until she retired in 1987. Throughout her political career Maynard advocated policies on the left of the Labour Party and chaired the left-wing Campaign Group. She served on the Agriculture Select Committee 1975–87. She played a leading role in securing the passage of the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 which regulated the tied cottage system that had caused misery to rural workers. Maynard died of cancer in Sowerby, North Yorkshire on 27 March 1998, the same day as fellow former MP, Joan Lestor. Her remains are buried alongside her immediate family at Thornton-le-Street."

  "text" : "John Patrick Ducker AO (29 March 1932 - 25 November 2005), Australian labour leader and politician, played a leading role in the Australian labour movement and the Australian Labor Party for 20 years. Ducker was born in Kingston upon Hull, in northern England, the son of a bus driver, and worked on the docks from the age of 14. He migrated to Australia with his family in 1950, and became an ironworker and active in the Federated Ironworkers Association, at that time controlled by the Communist Party of Australia. Ducker, a convert to Catholicism, was a strong anti-Communist and became a supporter of B.A. Santamaria's Industrial Groups, which campaigned successfully to overturn the Communist control of the union. From 1952 Ducker was an official of the union under the new anti-Communist leader, Laurie Short (a non-Catholic). When the Labor Party split in 1955 over the related issues of Communism and the role of Santamaria's \"Movement\" within the party, Ducker did not follow many other Catholic anti-Communists into the Democratic Labor Party, but remained in the Labor Party, becoming a leading figure in the party's right wing. His characteristic North English accent led to him becoming known as \"Broovver Dooker\" throughout the movement. In 1961 Ducker moved from the Ironworkers to the Labor Council of New South Wales, becoming first an organiser and in 1975 becoming Secretary. In 1972 he was appointed a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. He was also President of the New South Wales Labor Party and vice-president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. In these positions he supported successive New South Wales Labor leaders such as Pat Hills, Neville Wran and Barrie Unsworth (also a Catholic convert). In 1973 he was the main organiser of the leadership coup which replaced Hills as leader with Wran, who went on to become Premier of New South Wales for ten years. Ducker was also a powerful supporter of Federal Labor Leader Gough Whitlam in his battles with the left wing of the Labor Party during the 1960s. In 1970 Ducker was a leading figure in the internal crisis in the Labor Party that cemented Whitlam's leadership. Convinced of the need to remove the left-wing controllers of the Victorian branch of the party if Labor was to win the 1972 federal election, Ducker did a deal with the left-wing leader Clyde Cameron, under which the right shared power with the left in the New South Wales branch in exchange for Cameron's support for the reform of the Victorian branch. He had a long association with Mater Maria Catholic College In 1979 Ducker's health declined and he resigned all his official positions, but Wran appointed him Chairman of the New South Wales Public Service Board. He remained a powerful influence behind the scenes, supporting younger Labor leaders such as Graham Richardson, Bob Carr and Paul Keating. He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1979, and the Catholic Church awarded him a Papal knighthood. He was also appointed to several company boards, including Qantas and the poker machine giant Aristocrat Leisure Industries."

  "text" : "Sir John Lawson Ormrod Andrews KBE DL PC (15 July 1903 – 12 January 1986) was a member of both the Northern Ireland House of Commons and the Senate of Northern Ireland. Son of Prime Minister John Miller Andrews, he was educated at Moure Grange Preparatory School, County Down, and Shrewsbury School. Andrews entered Parliament as MP for Mid Down in 1953 (replacing his father), a seat which he represented until his resignation in 1964, when he was elected to the Senate where he sat until the Parliament was prorogued in 1972. His election to the senate was following a cabinet reshuffle, in which Andrews accepted demotion to the politically unimportant position of Government Minister in the Senate. He held several Cabinet positions, including Minister in the Senate from 1964 and Deputy Prime Minister from May 1969. He was a contender for the position of Prime Minister on the retirement of Lord Brookeborough, but when it became clear that Terence O'Neill had a comfortable lead over both Andrews and Brian Faulkner in the parliamentary party, no contest was held. In 1969 he was approached by O'Neill to succeed him, but he refused and James Chichester-Clark was elected During the 1970 Bannside and South Antrim by-elections, Andrews was at the centre of the UUP's pluralist campaign against Ian Paisley's Protestant Unionist Party, declaring \"What does Protestant Unionism mean? Does it mean that you have to put a sign over the door of the Unionist Party saying Protestants only?\" Andrews was knighted in 1973. In retirement, he served as President of the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland."

  "text" : "Jeffrey Hardee \"Jeff\" Atwater (born April 8, 1958) is currently the Chief Financial Officer of Florida. He is a Republican . Atwater moved to Florida at the age of 4 and grew up in North Palm Beach, Florida, where his father, a veteran World War II pilot and FBI agent, served as police chief. He went on to gain substantial experience in banking, and was elected to the North Palm Beach Village Council in 1993. Later, he served as chairman, president, and CEO of the Barnett Bank of Broward County and the Treasure Coast, and later as market president of Riverside National Bank for Palm Beach and Broward counties. In 2000, Atwater ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 83rd District, defeating Democratic nominee Pam Dunston and independent Michael I. Danchuk. After just two years in the House, he ran for the Florida Senate from the 25th District, which included Palm Beach and Broward counties. Unopposed in the primary election, Atwater faced off against long-serving Democratic Attorney General of Florida Bob Butterworth in the general election, and, aided by then-Governor Jeb Bush's strong performance that year, defeated Butterworth by a solid margin. He was re-elected in 2004 with no opposition, and again in 2008, when he defeated Democrat Linda Bird, a realtor. From 2008 to 2010, he was the president of the Florida Senate. Following the decision by then-Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink to run for governor rather than seek re-election, Atwater jumped into the race to succeed Sink. In the general election, Atwater faced off against former State Representative Loranne Ausley, whom he defeated, 57.3 to 38.9. Though considered as a frontrunner, in April 2015, he declined to run for the US Senate seat Marco Rubio is expected to vacate before the Senate elections, 2016 to run for the US Presidency. Atwater has since changed his mind, stating that he may run in the upcoming 2016 Senate election."

Born and raised in New London, Wisconsin, Voight received his Bachelor of Science from the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh in 1971. After serving as an Army sergeant from 1968–70, he moved to Appleton, Wisconsin, where he established an insurance agency. Voight served on the Appleton City Council from 1983–1993, holding the position of council president from 1992 - 1993. When incumbent Treasurer Cathy Zeuske ran in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in 1994, Voight ran as the Republican nominee to replace her. He was elected that year, and re-elected in 1998 and 2002. He was defeated for re-election on November 7, 2006, by Democrat Dawn Marie Sass, a former parole officer and AFSCME union activist, now working as a clerk at the department store Boston Store, in what was considered an upset. Voight had defeated Sass in both 1998 and 2002, and Sass said she spent less than $4000 on the race, most out of her own pocket. Voight held the position of president of the National Association of State Treasurers in 1997. In May 2009, Voight announced his interest in seeking the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin in 2010, but instead, the following June Voight announced he was going to run to replace retiring Outagamie County Executive Toby Paltzer. On April 5, 2011, he was defeated by former Assemblyman and unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor Tom Nelson, by roughly 52% - 48%. Voight blamed the political unrest stemming from Governor Scott Walker's policy drive to eliminate public workers' collective bargaining powers, saying \"The labor movement has not only energized the Democratic Party base but a lot of the independents.\""

Sheffield became a city, while Langley organised a conference in the city, aiming to settle the 1893 UK coal strike. Claiming to represent the interests of the working class, he was elected as the Member of Parliament at the Sheffield Attercliffe by-election, 1894. As an employer, he was a controversial choice, and the Independent Labour Party stood a candidate against him. Langley became the first President of the General Union of Railway Clerks in 1897, although he resigned due to ill health the following year.

  "text" : "John Samuel Potts (12 August 1861 – 28 April 1938) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom who served a Member of Parliament (MP) for twelve years between 1922 and 1938. Born in Bolton, Lancashire, Potts had started work at Durham Colliery at the age of eleven. He was a checkweighman at the Hemsworth Colliery, Yorkshire, for 25 years. At the Barnsley by-election of 1897 Potts supported the Liberal Party-candidate Joseph Walton. While chairing a Liberal election meeting during this by-election, Potts said in the presence of Walton that he would favour a labour party at a time when state payment of MPs, and of official election expenses would enable working men to be maintained in Parliament. But until then, \"the Liberal party was the working man’s only hope\". In 1905, Potts switched sides, and started working with the Independent Labour Party against Walton, and the leadership of the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA). Ten years later Potts was elected as treasurer of the YMA, and became a member of the executive committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. He kept these positions until he was elected as MP for Barnsley at the 1922 general election, when payment of MPs and election expenses had been enacted. Potts held the seat at three further elections in the 1920s. When Labour split at the 1931 general election over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of a National Government, he narrowly lost his seat to the National Liberal candidate Richard John Soper. Potts was comfortably re-elected at the 1935 general election, but died in office in 1938, in Barnsley, aged 76. His illness and death have been connected with the shock he received when the Wharncliffe Woodmoor Pit Disaster occurred two years earlier. His home was in the lane which led to the colliery."

Born in England, he came to Canada and studied law before setting up a practice in Calgary. He became a prominent resident of that city, and served two years on its city council. In the early 1930s, he was one of the few prominent and respectable Calgarians to support William Aberhart's Social Credit League. He ran as a candidate for it in the 1935 provincial election and, when it won, was named Attorney General by Aberhart. Hugill's time as Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) was dominated by differences of opinion with Aberhart. Hugill did not believe that social credit could be legally implemented by a provincial government and did not support the government's attempts to do so. When asked by Lieutenant Governor John Campbell Bowen whether he considered three of the government's acts to be constitutional, he replied honestly that he did not; this prompted Aberhart to request his resignation. Thereafter Hugill was an outspoken opponent of the Aberhart government, though he did not seek re-election in the 1940 election. He retired from the practice of law in 1949, and died in 1971."

A woods contractor in the Miramichi, Richardson became active in the union movement and was a staff representative with the Canadian Food and Allied Workers union (CFAW) and later served as secretary-treasurer of the New Brunswick Federation of Labour from 1981 to 1986. As NDP leader, Richardson was on the right wing of the party and opposed to the militancy of radicalized university students involved with the NDP. He criticized left winger NDPers who had protested the implementation of the War Measures Act during the 1970 October Crisis and was challenged by the New Brunswick chapter of The Waffle, a left wing faction in the NDP made up of Marxist students as well as older leftist activists. Under the leadership of veteran Fredericton socialist Pat Callaghan, the Waffle narrowly had its manifesto adopted by the New Brunswick NDP at a convention in the fall of 1971. The Waffle took over the party with Callaghan displacing Richardson as leader in October 1971. However, the federal party intervened and called a special convention the next month which routed the Waffle and restored Richardson as party leader. Richardson led the NDP through the 1970 and 1974 provincial elections in which the party ran seats in most of the province's ridings for the first time since the party's inception in 1960 but failed to win any seats or take the party above 3% of the popular vote. He stepped down in 1976 and returned to the union movement. He died on April 2, 2002."

  "text" : "Joseph \"Joe\" Berrios (born February 14, 1952) is a Democratic politician who is the Assessor of Cook County, Illinois, and an Illinois state government lobbyist. One of seven children of Puerto Rican native parents, and raised in the Cabrini-Green public housing project, he became the first Hispanic American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly and the first and only Hispanic American to chair the Cook County Democratic Party. He was a Commissioner on the Cook County Board of Review, a property tax assessment appeal panel. Throughout his career, Berrios combined government sector jobs, elected office, unpaid political party leadership positions, and private sector proprietorships in lobbying, consulting and insurance sales. His political campaign strategies included ballot access challenges to potential opponents. He has been the focus of investigations into allegations of ethics violations and political corruption with respect to campaign fund-raising and nepotism. In the press and in the courts, Berrios has repeatedly defended his right as an elected official to hire relatives and to accept campaign contributions from those with business before his office."

One of his first prominent actions as a city councillor was a speech protesting police harassment of participants in the city's 1924 May Day parade. In 1931, he built a public bathhouse at the corner of Bagg and St. Lawrence, which still stands today as the Schubert Bath (official French name: Bain Schubert). He served for three months as the city's acting mayor, commencing August 29, 1927, under mayor Médéric Martin. (Despite the title \"acting mayor\", however, he was never the city's official leader; in modern terms, his role would be more accurately understood as that of a deputy mayor or a mayor pro tem.) Until the appointment of Michael Applebaum as interim mayor in 2012, he was the highest ranking Jewish official in the history of Montreal's municipal government."

Mlacak was born in 1936 in Windsor, Ontario, the son of Croat immigrants. He received a bachelor's and master's degree in engineering from Queen's University. After his education, he began working for the Northern Electric Company, which later became Nortel. He stayed with Nortel until 1995. During his career, he also served as a commissioner with the National Capital Commission and was on the planning committee for the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. In 1964, Mlacak and his wife were one of the first families to move to the new subdivision of Beaverbrook. He was interested in planning issues and was excited about the prospect of beginning a community from scratch, which spurred an interest to enter politics. He served as reeve of the then-mostly rural March Township from 1968 to 1976. The rapidly suburbanizing township would become the City of Kanata in 1978, and would later be amalgamated into Ottawa in 2001. During his retirement, Mlacak focused on a career in painting. He co-founded the Kanata Civic Art Gallery and one of his works was featured in the Croatian Embassy. He was elected as a member of the Society of Canadian Artists in 2009."

She served as the Minister of Justice and Public Safety, Attorney General and Minister Responsible for the Status of Women in the provincial cabinet from September 30, 2014, to March 12, 2015. Manning was appointed to cabinet by Premier Paul Davis despite not holding a seat in the House of Assembly. Manning's appointment to cabinet came under fire due to her not being an elected member and because she was unwilling to seek a seat in the House of Assembly in three by-elections. Manning stated she intended to be the Progressive Conservative candidate in the district of Placentia—St. Mary's when that seat became available. The seat is currently represented by Felix Collins who had previously indicated he would not seek re-election. On March 12, 2015, Manning was removed from cabinet along with two other ministers. Davis cited cost savings as his reason for reducing his cabinet but also noted he was unwilling to have Manning serve in cabinet for up to a year without her holding a seat in the legislature. Davis said he had originally planned on calling a spring election but that was delayed till the fall by his government's decision to remove eight seats from he House of Assembly. It was later reported that when Manning was appointed to cabinet she and Davis were under the impression that Collins would resign his seat in the near future, creating a by-election for her to run in. However, Collins did not resign his seat and he found himself back in cabinet as Attorney General after Manning's departure due to him being the only lawyer within caucus."

He was a member of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party. Smith was born in Liverpool, Nova Scotia in 1935, and grew up in Port Mouton. Smith graduated with a medical degree from Dalhousie University in 1964. He practiced family medicine in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia for almost 30 years. Smith first attempted to enter provincial politics in the 1981 election, but was defeated by Progressive Conservative incumbent Richard L. Weldon. Smith ran again in the 1984 election, defeating Weldon by 903 votes to win the Dartmouth East riding. One of only six Liberals elected, Smith spent the early years of his political career in opposition. He was re-elected in the 1988 election, winning the seat by 253 votes. Smith was re-elected in the 1993 election, defeating cabinet minister Gwen Haliburton by almost 2,500 votes. Following the election, Smith would get to sit in government for the first time, as the Liberals under John Savage won a majority government. On June 11, 1993, Smith was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Community Services. On June 27, 1996, Savage shuffled his cabinet, with Smith being named Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs. On June 6, 1997, Savage announced that Smith would take over as Minister of Health on June 9, when Bernie Boudreau resigns from cabinet to run for the Liberal leadership. Smith remained as Minister of Health when Russell MacLellan took over as premier on July 18, 1997. Smith was re-elected in the 1998 election, and retained the health portfolio, but was also named Minister of Justice. In December 1998, Smith was replaced as Minister of Justice, as MacLellan shuffled his cabinet to reduce the heavy workload of some of the cabinet. Smith was re-elelcted by 265 votes in the 1999 election, but the Liberals were defeated by John Hamm's Progressive Conservatives. Smith served in opposition for one term, announcing on May 2, 2003, that he would not seek re-election in the next election."

In 1993 he was elected as a Reform Member of Parliament in the Saskatchewan riding of Kindersley—Lloydminster. He was the Reform Party House Leader from 1993 until 1995. Due to redistribution his hometown was located in the new constituency of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar for the 1997 election. He ran against fellow incumbent Chris Axworthy of the New Democratic Party for the new seat and lost. Hermanson sought the leadership of the newly founded Saskatchewan Party in 1998, and defeated Rod Gantefoer and Yogi Huyghebaert in a one member one vote election. He was elected to the provincial legislature for Rosetown-Biggar in the 1999 provincial election and became Leader of the Opposition. While the party reduced the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party to a minority government, it was almost nonexistent outside the rural areas; it was completely shut out in Regina and won only one seat in Saskatoon. Ultimately, this left the Saskatchewan Party five seats short of making Hermanson Premier. Hermanson was widely expected to lead the party to victory in 2003. However, he came up short again in the provincial election that November, in which the NDP actually won a bare majority. While the Saskatchewan Party scored a net gain of two seats, both in Saskatoon, it was shut out of Regina once again. Hermanson resigned days after the election and was subsequently succeeded by Brad Wall. Hermanson remained the MLA for the new constituency of Rosetown-Elrose. On Friday, June 23, 2006, Hermanson announced that he would not be seeking re-election to the legislature."

  "text" : "Edmund Leverett Morris (4 February 1923 – 3 January 2003) was a Canadian politician, broadcaster and university administrator. Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Morris attended school at Saint Mary's Boys School. After graduating high school, he pursued an undergraduate and graduate degree in political science from Dalhousie University. After graduation he went to work for a local radio station in Halifax. He was married to Lorraine Ware and had six children. In the 1953 federal election, Morris made his first attempt into politics when he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the electoral district of Halifax. Although he lost, he continued to be involved in politics at the local level, and offered himself for election again in the 1957 election, in which he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada. Between 1957 and 1963, Morris represented the riding of Halifax in the House of Commons. He held the positions of Parliamentary Secretary to the Postmaster General, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Commerce. In 1963, Morris was appointed as chief assistant to the President of Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Saint Mary's, a Catholic university administered by the Society of Jesus, saw Morris serving as one of the few lay persons on staff. Morris was instrumental in large scale building programs at the university throughout the 1960s as well as the eventual change of the university to non-denominational institution in 1970. Morris served as Interim President of Saint Mary's University during the school year 1970–1971. Between 1974 and 1980, Morris served as Mayor of the City of Halifax.

Joyce served as chair of the Canadian Paraplegic Association. In 2000, he was elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador Soccer Hall of Fame. Joyce was first elected in the 1989 election — however, as party leader Clyde Wells had been defeated by Lynn Verge in his own riding despite leading the Liberal Party to victory, Joyce stepped aside to allow Wells to contest the seat in a by-election. He worked in the executive offices of Wells and his successor as Premier, Brian Tobin, until the 1999 election, when he ran for office again in Bay of Islands. He won the seat and served until the 2007 election, when he was defeated by Terry Loder. In October 2010, Joyce announced that he would re-seek the Liberal nomination, and in the 2011 provincial election he defeated Loder to reclaim his old seat. On July 18, 2013 Joyce was named Leader of the Opposition and interim Liberal leader, replacing Dwight Ball who resigned to run for the provincial leadership permanently in the party's 2013 convention."

  "text" : "Elisala Pita OBE (d. 22 August 2016) was a Tuvaluan politician. Pita \"had a long and distinguished career with the Fisheries Department\" in Tuvalu, \"culminating in his being employed as a Fisheries Adviser with the USAID\". For the latter position, he was based in Suva, Fiji. He eventually returned to his home country, and worked in public service, becoming Permanent Secretary for Natural Resources and the Environment. In 2001, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, \"for public and community service\". He first entered parliament as an MP for Nukufetau in a by-election in October 2003. At the time, Prime Minister Saufatu Sopoanga was struggling to retain a majority in parliament. There are no political parties in Tuvalu, and Pita was elected without having said which side of parliament he would join. He considered the matter for several days after his election, then joined the government's side, helping it maintain a majority. In August 2004, however, he crossed the floor, providing the Opposition with the majority it needed to topple the government through a motion of no confidence. Over the following weeks, Opposition leader Maatia Toafa and ousted prime minister Saufatu Sopoanga formed an unexpected alliance. Pita seized the opportunity to challenge for the premiership. A vote in parliament on 11 October made Toafa prime minister with eight votes, Sopoanga serving as his deputy. Pita received seven votes, and became the leader of the Opposition. He held the position until the 2006 general election, after which he sat as a backbencher. From 2008 to 2010, as MP, he was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. He lost his seat in parliament in the 2010 general election, with Enele Sopoanga (brother of the former Prime Minister) replacing him. He subsequently served as Chief Executive of the Tuvalu National Private Sector Organisation, lobbying for \"stronger ties between the private sector and the government\". He was selected as the Opposition's candidate for a crucial by-election in Nukufetau on 28 June 2013, which would determine which side of parliament had a majority. Pita pledged, if elected, to enable the Opposition leader Enele Sopoanga, the man who whose election ousted Pita from parliament, to bid for the premiership. He won the seat with more than two thirds of the vote, and the Opposition immediately asked for parliament to be reconvened. After the subsequent vote of no confidence in the government of Willy Telavi, Elisala Pita was appointed Minister for Works and Natural Resources on 5 August 2013 following Enele Sopoaga becoming prime minister. Following the Tuvaluan general election, 2015 Elisala Pita was re-appointed as the Minister for Works and Natural Resources. Pita died on 22 August 2016 in Funafuti."

He served in the Florida House of Representatives from Brevard County from 1885 to 1887. He was born to John and Eliza (McCall) Brack in Georgia on June 17, 1837. He married firstly to the former Olive Chancey (1838–1864) of Clinch County, Georgia, by whom he had two sons who died young. The Bracks removed to Alexandria, Louisiana before the outbreak of the American Civil War. During that conflict, the future mayor served in Company C of the 27th Louisiana Infantry Regiment. After the war, the widowed Brack came to Florida, where he married his second wife Amy (July 5, 1847 - May 25, 1880). They had three daughters before her untimely death: Olive, Bessie, and Josphine Brack. It is unclear exactly when Brack settled in the Orlando area. He was certainly there by October 16, 1873, when he was mentioned as guardian ad litem for the orphans of Mrs. Lucinda Hughey Terrell in a lawsuit filed in the circuit court of Orange County, Florida. In 1875, when Orlando was formally incorporated, Brack was elected its first mayor. He was subsequently re-elected to a second one-year term. After leaving office, the former mayor remained in the Orlando area as a farmer and fruit grower until at least 1880. He was married there to his third wife Eliza Alpha Tyson on March 6, 1881. They had eight children: John Percy (\"Jack\"), Rosa Banner, Gussie, Emma Hortense, Ruby B, Blanche Alice, and Lillian Bell Brack, William Jackson, Jr The Bracks left Orlando to live on the north shore of Lake Tohopekaliga in what is now Osceola County, Florida, where they operated a general store and sawmill at \"Brack's Landing.\" From that point, he also captained a 35-foot sidewheel steamboat called \"Spray\" along the inland canals that connected the Kissimmee River valley to Fort Myers, Florida on the Gulf of Mexico. The former mayor retired to a cattle ranch near Narcoossee, Florida, where he died April 30, 1901. He is buried at Mount Peace Cemetery in Saint Cloud, Florida."

  "text" : "Wyon Dale \"W. D.\" Childers (born November 25, 1933) is a former West Florida politician who served 30 years in the State Senate, from 1970 to 2000, including a stint as Senate President from 1980 to 1982 and as dean from 1988 to 2000. He holds the title of Florida's longest-serving state legislator. He earned the nickname \"Banty Rooster\" – after the diminutive, swaggering barnyard fowl – and became known for his eccentric mannerisms and colorful, folksy expressions. Childers was popular in his district for the ample state funding and \"turkey\" projects he sent home, including $12.5 million for the Pensacola Civic Center and the I-110 extension to Gregory Street. Initially a Democrat, he switched to the Republican Party in 1995. After term limits forced him from the Florida Senate in 2000, Childers ran for the District 1 seat of the Escambia County Commission. He became embroiled in the soccer complex corruption scandal and was found guilty of violating the Florida Sunshine Law and of bribing Commissioner Willie Junior to help push the purchases of two properties, totaling $6.2 million, from Childers' associates Joe and Georgann Elliott. Childers served nearly three years of a 42-month prison sentence in West Palm Beach and was released on 17 June 2009, after which he relocated away from Pensacola. On 8 June 2010, a federal appeals court overturned the bribery conviction, ruling that Childers' constitutional right to confront his accuser had been violated, as the defense team was not allowed to question Junior on his change of testimony."

Hayward was an unsuccessful candidate for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1898. He was president of the Central Dairy Institute, a director of the Dairymen's Association of British Columbia and secretary-treasurer for the BC Fruit Growers Association. On several occasions, Hayward proposed amendments to the province's Land Act to bar non-Caucasians from acquiring Crown lands in the province. In 1916, he ran for reelection as an Independent candidate, although he was endorsed by the Conservatives. He resigned his seat in November 1918 \"due to official military duties in Ottawa\". He died at London in 1932."

Shelly became vice-president and general manager of the new company. He was also president of the Home Oil Co. Ltd., Canada Grain Export Co. Ltd., Guaranty Savings and Loan, Crescent Beach Development Co. Ltd., Grouse Mountain Highway and Scenic Resort Ltd. and the Shelly Building. Shelly served as finance minister in the provincial cabinet. In the fiscal year 1929/1930, the province suffered a fairly small deficit of $135,000. Shelly projected an increase of government revenues and a small surplus for the following fiscal year; instead, revenues decreased and expenditures were larger than projected, resulting in a then-record deficit of $4.8 million. Shelly was transferred to the position of president of the Executive Council in October 1930. He also suffered a large personal financial loss when share prices for Home Oil Co. Ltd. bottomed out in the years following the stock market crash. He retired from politics in 1933. Shelly died in Vancouver at the age of 72."

  "text" : "Pertti Olavi \"Veltto\" Virtanen (born 18 May 1951 in Hämeenlinna) is a rock personality, former presidential candidate, and former member of the Finnish Parliament from Tampere, Finland. In music he performed both as a solo artist and in the bands Virtanen (with Moog Konttinen), Välikausitakki and Sammas. Elektroninen xstaasi is considered the most famous of Veltto Virtanen's songs. Välikausitakki was notable for including also Mikko Alatalo, Harri Rinne and later also Juice Leskinen. After running as an avowed spoiler in the 1994 presidential election, his surprisingly respectable popular vote spurred him to run in the 1995 election for the house of representatives as an essentially independent candidate, and indeed managed to get in. His terms in the Parliament were characteristically quixotic; the speeches he made being exercises in near-shamanistic eloqution, and counter to parliamentary protocol refusing to bare his head, sporting various headgear, but being most famous for his \"artistic\" beret. Although mostly a picturesque spice to the daily routines of the institution, he enjoyed considerable respect from many colleagues in the house. The negligible party KiPu which tactically allied themselves to Veltto, never gained a member of its own, with or without his help; and thus he formed a one-man party-group in the house. Outside critics of the phenomenon of his political success wrote a muckraking book Huijari - Veltto Virtanen & Kirjava Puolue (publisher: Veitikka Kustannus 1999). He continued in elective politics by running in the 1999 and 2003 parliamentary elections with prodigious electoral votes, but failing to enter the house due to the punitive nature for minor parties of the Finnish D'Hondt method of voting. Virtanen became again a member of Parliament in parliamentary elections of 2007, this time representing the True Finns party. He served two terms but did not run as candidate anymore in the parliamentary elections of 2015 Besides his musical and political career, he has also worked as a motivational speaker, most notably for some winter sports teams. Currently he is a member of the Finnish Parliament and municipal council of Tampere. In Mayday 2011 the newly elected member of the parliament delivered a somewhat controversial political Mayday speech, where he stated that if the Swedish People's Party were to become part of the next cabinet with the True Finns, he would resign from the party and vomit for five days. - Jos perussuomalaiset lähtevät samaan hallitukseen RKP:n kanssa, eroan puolueesta ja oksennan viisi päivää."

They have one son, Kevin, who is a physician in Ottawa. He was first elected to Timmins City Council as a city councillor in 1968, and served for twelve years before being elected mayor in 1980.

He first announced his retirement from politics in 2000, and was succeeded as mayor by Jamie Lim. In the 2003 municipal election, however, Power challenged Lim and was re-elected mayor. Power has also served as president of the Federation of Northern Ontario Municipalities, and as a director of Ontario Northland Transportation Commission and the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. Power's mayoralty has been marked by ongoing efforts to diversify the city's mining-based economy. In 2004, he received national attention when he criticized the producers of Shania: A Life in Eight Albums, a television biopic of country star Shania Twain, for producing the film in Sudbury rather than Twain's actual hometown, Timmins. On August 31, 2006, Power announced his second retirement from politics; he would not be seeking the mayoralty in the 2006 elections. He was succeeded by Tom Laughren, the sole declared candidate for the mayoralty. On May 31, 2007, the city's airport was renamed Timmins/Victor M. Power Airport in honor of the former mayor. In attendance were several councillors and politicians from across the region. Power received the Order of Canada in 2009."

At the same time, he was also made deputy PM in the cabinet of Gerasim Khugayev.

Born in Singleton, New South Wales and educated at Shore School, Treatt interrupted his studies at the University of Sydney to enlist at the outbreak of the First World War. Serving in the Royal Australian Artillery, Treatt served in France and was awarded the Military Medal. Upon returning to Australia he was awarded a Rhodes scholarship and further educated at New College, Oxford. After briefly practising law in 1923 in Britain, Treatt returned to Australia and was admitted to the New South Wales bar that same year, serving as a Crown Prosecutor at the supreme court. Treatt also was the Challis law lecturer at the University of Sydney. Treatt entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 26 March 1938, representing the Electoral district of Woollahra for the United Australia Party (UAP). When UAP Premier Bertram Stevens was ousted from the leadership in August 1939 and Alexander Mair became Premier, Mair appointed Treatt, after serving only a few months in Parliament, as the Minister for Justice. He served in this office until the UAP lost power in 1941. During this time Treatt witnessed the break-up of the UAP into the various parties including the Democratic Party, which he joined, and then the establishment of the Liberal Party of Australia as the major conservative political force in Australia in 1945. When the second leader of the party, Alexander Mair, resigned in March 1946, Treatt was elected to succeed him. As the third leader of the new party, Treatt became the first leader to contest an election. After serving eight years and almost winning government at the 1950 election, Treatt resigned as Leader in August 1954 following a July attempt to depose him. He continued as a member of parliament until he was defeated in 1962 and thereafter served in various organisations and posts, including as a Chief Commissioner of the City of Sydney in 1969, until his death in 1984."

His political journey began after he was elected the Sarpanch or head of his Sofi village (Jalandhar District). He has held several key posts in the BJP's Punjab unit. When he was a 27-year-old bereaved dalit, Sampla was trying to find his feet against the oppressive landlords of Jalandhar's Sofi Pind. His brother and he were left to fend for themselves after their father's death and Sampla went off to Saudi Arabia in 1979 to work for a plumbing company. On his swearing-in as BJP's first minister from Punjab in NDA-II, he says, \"I often recall one incident that shaped my life. While I was in Saudi Arabian city of Damam, I was asked to clean human excreta and repair a bathroom. I was young and flatly refused to do the cleaning part while telling the building owner that I was a plumber. On my insistence, the man put on plastic gloves and cleaned the muck himself. It taught me the difference between oppression against dalits and the will to work\", Sampla recalled."

  "text" : "Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon PC SL KC (5 October 1732 – 4 April 1802) was a British politician and barrister, who served as Attorney General, Master of the Rolls and Lord Chief Justice. Born to a country gentleman, he was initially educated in Hanmer before moving to Ruthin School aged 12. Rather than going to university he instead worked as a clerk to an attorney, joining the Middle Temple in 1750 and being called to the Bar in 1756. Initially almost unemployed due to the lack of education and contacts which a university education would have provided, his business increased thanks to his friendships with John Dunning, who, overwhelmed with cases, allowed Kenyon to work many, and Lord Thurlow who secured for him the Chief Justiceship of Chester in 1780. He was returned as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hindon the same year, serving repeatedly as Attorney General under William Pitt the Younger. He effectively sacrificed his political career in 1784 to challenge the ballot of Charles James Fox, and was rewarded with a baronetcy; from then on he did not speak in the House of Commons, despite remaining an MP. On 27 March 1784 he was appointed Master of the Rolls, a job to which he dedicated himself once he ceased to act as an MP. He had previously practised in the Court of Chancery, and although unfamiliar with Roman law was highly efficient; Lord Eldon said \"I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than any of my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beat us all\". On 9 June 1788, Kenyon succeeded Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice, and was granted a barony. Although not rated as highly as his predecessor, his work \"restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law\". He remained Lord Chief Justice until his death in 1802."

He later became the first Ontario Supreme Court justice ever to be removed from the bench, after being implicated in the Northern Ontario Natural Gas scandal. Landreville, a native of Ottawa, practiced law in Sudbury in the 1940s and 1950s before becoming the city's mayor. During his mayoral term, he was offered an option on 10,000 shares of stock in Northern Ontario Natural Gas, a company run by Ralph K. Farris that was seeking a municipal agreement on the construction of a natural gas pipeline through Northern Ontario. When the NONG contract was approved by city council, Farris purchased the shares at the original price offered to Landreville, sold 2,500 shares to reimburse the company, and delivered the 7,500 remaining shares to Landreville at no cost. Following his appointment to the Supreme Court, Landreville sold the shares for a profit of $117,000. After an Ontario Securities Commission investigation into NONG's stock distributions, it was ultimately revealed that many of Northern Ontario's mayors, as well as some members of Premier Leslie Frost's cabinet, had received low-cost shares. After a second investigation, Landreville was charged with municipal corruption and conspiracy, and was acquitted as there was no evidence that he had exerted any influence on Sudbury's city council to approve the NONG contract. In response, however, the Law Society of Upper Canada held a secret hearing in which it determined that despite the acquittal, Landreville's conduct had fallen below the \"standards of probity\" demanded of a judge, and called for his resignation. In 1966, Prime Minister Lester Pearson appointed a Royal Commission, chaired by Ivan Rand, to investigate the case. Controversially, the Law Society report was admitted into the proceedings, but the original judgement acquitting Landreville of misconduct was not. Landreville was also never given an opportunity, as required under law, to respond to the royal commission's report. Landreville initially refused to resign from the bench, leading Pearson's government to announce, on June 6, 1967, an unusual joint address of the House of Commons and the Senate to have him removed from the bench. He was then convinced to resign voluntarily with the promise of a partial pension. Pierre Trudeau, then Justice Minister, later wrote to advise Landreville that the federal cabinet had decided not to offer Landreville the pension, although subsequent Access to Information requests revealed that the cabinet had made no such decision. Landreville waged a ten-year legal battle to have the pension offer honoured, and was finally offered $250,000. Landreville subsequently returned to practicing law."

Larry Campbell began his career in the army and was honorably discharged as a Sergeant First Class. Campbell served as the Republic leader from 1982-1990. Campbell is credited with engineering his party's 1990 takeover of the state legislature, which lasted 16 years. He began working as a lobbyist in 1995, immediately after the end of his legislative term. He was criticized for pre-filing a bill that benefitted a client, with whom he had signed a contract while still a legislator. In 1999, he was considered the most powerful man in Salem. He started the Oregon Victory PAC, which quickly became the biggest lobbying group in the state outside the major parties; it contributed over $750,000 to Oregon politicians in the 1990s. He drew criticism for campaigning on behalf of Republican control of the legislature during the 2007 legislative session."

The Tory government was defeated in the 1989 general election and Simms moved to the Opposition benches. He succeeded Rideout in 1991 to become Leader of the Opposition and party leader. The party lost the 1993 general election and Simms resigned as party leader two years later. He was appointed head of the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation by Premier Danny Williams in 2005. In 2007 he stepped down in order to take a senior role in Williams' 2007 re-election campaign and was immediately re-appointed to the $130,000 a year housing corporation position following the election leading to complaints of \"blatant patronage\" from the Opposition."

She also served on the Yukon Employment Standards Board, the Yukon Electoral District Boundaries Commission and has held positions on the boards of the Yukon College Employees Union and the Yukon Federation of Labour. In the 1992 Yukon election, Moorcroft was successful in her attempt to enter politics in the seat of Mount Lorne. A strong feminist activist, her campaign platform was built on pay equality for women and fighting against violations of the Canadian Human Rights Act. After a term in government, Moorcroft sought reelection in the 1996 Yukon election, gaining 33.2% of the votes, compared with Liberal Party candidate Ken Taylor, with 20.5%. During her second term, Moorcroft managed to obtain the positions of Minister for Justice, Education and the Women's Directorate. In the 2000 Yukon provincial election, Moorcroft again contested the seat of Mount Lorne but lost it to Liberal Party candidate Cynthia Tucker, 36% to 27%. Tucker served for one term in Mount Lorne until she was replaced in 2002 by Steve Cardiff. She continues to advocate for women and First Nations rights. In April 2006 Moorcroft was appointed to the Yukon Human Rights Commission. In June 2011 she announced that she was running as the NDP candidate in the Copperbelt South riding in the 2011 election. She won on election night by a margin of just three votes over Yukon Party candidate Valerie Boxall; her victory was confirmed in a recount."

  "text" : "(This article is about the Sinn Féin politician. For the American ice hockey player, see Connor Murphy.) Conor Terence Murphy (born 10 July 1963) is an Irish republican Sinn Féin politician who is the Member of the Legislative Assembly of Northern Ireland for Newry and Armagh. He served as the Member of Parliament for Newry and Armagh from 2005-2015. Murphy was born in Camlough, South Armagh and joined the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the 1981 hunger strikes. In 1982 he was sentenced to five years in prison for IRA membership and possession of explosives. Between 1989 and 1997, he was a Sinn Féin councillor on Newry and Mourne District Council for The Fews area, in South Armagh and South Down, and served as his party's group leader at that level. In 1998, Murphy was elected as one of his party's two Northern Ireland Assembly members for Newry and Armagh. He was re-elected, with two party colleagues, to the Assembly in 2003. He lives in Camlough, County Armagh with his wife Catherine, his daughter Áine and his son Oisín. He attended St Colman's College, Newry, Queen's University of Belfast (QUB), and the University of Ulster. In 2001, he contested the Newry and Armagh Westminster seat, coming second to incumbent Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). When Mallon decided not to contest the seat again, Murphy became the clear favourite to win and was elected on 5 May 2005. He refused to take his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in line with the abstentionist policy of Sinn Féin. In the Northern Ireland Assembly, he served as the Minister for Regional Development in the Northern Ireland Executive from 8 May 2007 until 16 May 2011. While on a tour of UK party conferences in autumn 2005, he became the first Irish republican to address the Conservative Party conference and caused controversy by refusing to express regret over the Brighton hotel bombing. In 2011, while Minister for Regional Development, Murphy appointed Sean Hogan, a Catholic, as head of Northern Ireland Water, turning down the applications of four Protestants on the shortlist. A tribunal subsequently awarded £150,000 damages for discrimination to one of these applicants, Alan Lennon, judging that Hogan was appointed because \"he was not from a Protestant background and because he was known to the minister and his (then Sinn Fein) ministerial colleagues Michelle Gildernew and Caitriona Ruane, who were consulted about the appointment.\" The tribunal found Murphy's evidence was \"implausible and lack[ing] credibility\", and that, during Murphy's tenure at the Department for Regional Development, there was a \"material bias against the appointment of candidates from a Protestant background\". Murphy disputed the finding which he said branded him \"sectarian\". Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness defended him, claiming Murphy doesn't have \"a sectarian bone in his body\". In December 2012, Murphy appeared as a witness at Belfast High Court in the case of Declan Gormley, whom Murphy had sacked in 2010 from his post as a non-executive director of NI Water. Gormley sued Sinn Féin over two press releases which he argued were defamatory. Gormley was subsequently offered £80,000 in damages."

  "text" : "Chris Korwin-Kuczynski (born 1953) is a former Canadian municipal politician. He served as a councillor in Toronto from 1981 to 2003, and was the city's deputy mayor for a time. He was born in Toronto, and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from York University. He has been a director of the Polish-Canadian Congress, and has served as a special assistant to the federal Minister of State for Multiculturalism. He ran unsuccessfully for city council in 1980 as Chris Korwin but was successful on his second attempt, in a 1981 by-election. In 1992, Korwin-Kuczynski successfully urged that the music group Barenaked Ladies be banned from performing a concert in Nathan Phillips Square because he believed their name objectified women (Toronto Star, 20 July 2005). This decision was widely ridiculed, and gave considerable publicity to the then-obscure band. Korwin-Kuczynski was a member of the council's right-wing, and was a frequent ally of fellow councillor Tom Jakobek (Toronto Star, 29 November 1994). Kyle Rae has suggested that Korwin-Kuczynski became isolated on council when Jakobek left in 2000 (Globe and Mail, 16 September 2003). In 1993, Korwin-Kuczynski was removed as chair of the Toronto Board of Health after criticizing a strongly worded AIDS prevention pamphlet published by the AIDS Committee of Toronto (Toronto Star, 23 January 1993). He had suggested that the Committee, which received significant support from Toronto's gay community, be denied city funding if it continued publishing such materials (Globe and Mail, 25 January 1995). Referring to his dismissal after the vote, he commented, \"[t]he only real issue I think this all stems from is AIDS, the whole issue surrounding the gay issue\" (Toronto Star, 22 January 1993). Kyle Rae, who is openly gay, has said that Korwin-Kuczynski was anti-gay during the early 1990s but later changed his views. In 2003, Rae was quoted as saying, \"He's now generally supportive of these issues, but that didn't come easily.\" He opposed a 1996 municipal bill that banned smoking in restaurants and bars, and requested that provincial Premier Mike Harris veto the measure (Montreal Gazette, 8 July 1996). Korwin-Kuczynski considered running for the Liberal nomination in Parkdale—High Park in the 1997 federal election, but ultimately declined (Toronto Star, 16 February 1997). He retired from the council in 2003, amid rumours that he would move into consulting work (Toronto Star, 24 December 2003). He endorsed Dennis Mills's bid for re-election in the 2004 federal election, and a newspaper report from the period suggest that he was considering running as a Liberal candidate in the next federal election (Globe and Mail, 22 December 2003). On September 27, 2006, he filed papers to run in the Toronto municipal election, 2006 in Ward 14. However the next day he withdrew his nomination. This allowed him to retain a fundraising surplus of $21,742 leftover from his last campaign. If he hadn't done this the money would have flowed into the city coffers. Korwin-Kuczynski is a former honorary Captain of the Canadian Navy, and once served as a Director on the board of the Royal Canadian Military Institute in Toronto. His nickname is K-K."

Bombolas won the seat against the incumbent member Michael Caltabiano of the Liberal Party. On 9 July 2007, Bombolas became Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister for Sport and Local Government, Andrew Fraser. Bombolas announced on 19 February 2009 that he would not contest the 2009 state election. In June 2009, Bombolas became the Chairman of the A-league football club Brisbane Roar. His controversial decision to replace coach Frank Farina with Ange Postecoglou saw the Brisbane Roar win the record for the longest unbeaten run at the top level of any Australian football code, which stands at 36 league matches without defeat.[3] Brisbane Roar are also the first and only club to win back to back A-League Championships.[4] In 2012, Bombolas was asked to join Hancock Coal/GVK as their External Affairs Advisor (Media & Corporate Communications Advisor). He now works as a freelance Media and Communications Specialist, plus is a qualified Auctioneer."

He assumed the position of legal counsel from Kumiki Gibson in February 1997 after serving almost a decade as Tennessee Attorney General. In 1999 Charles Burson became Gore's Chief of Staff, replacing Ron Klain who resigned in August of that year. Burson is the son of Josie Burson and Leo Burson. He grew up in Shelby County, Tennessee, where he graduated from Central High School in Memphis in 1962. Burson received his Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of Michigan, his Master of Arts from the University of Cambridge, and his J.D. from Harvard Law School. Burson was a friend of Gore for over three decades at the time of his appointment as Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States. Charles Burson first became friends with the future Vice President in 1968 during the time Gore was studying Tennessee history at Memphis State University. In 1984 he was the chairman of Gore's senatorial campaign. This continued a family tradition of involvement with the Gores. Burson's parents were active in Tennessee Democratic politics, and his mother had held a position in Albert Gore Sr.'s senatorial campaign in 1958. Before joining the White House, Charles Burson held a variety of public and private roles. From 1970 until 1988, he worked in private practice as a lawyer. He briefly flirted with active politics in the 1978 when he lost a race to Republican Ed Williams for the East Memphis seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. In 1988 he was appointed the Tennessee Attorney General. In this capacity, Burson served on a number of public legal bodies. He was a member of the Tennessee Board of Law Examiners, of the Tennessee Code Commission and of the Commission on the Future of the Judicial System. Burson also represented the state several times before the Supreme Court of the United States. One notable case he argued was Burson v. Freeman, which established a state's ability to regulate election advertising on voting day. After his time in the White House, Burson served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the global agribusiness corporation, Monsanto. Burson is married to Bunny Burson and has two daughters, Clare and Kate. He presently resides in St. Louis, Missouri, teaches at the Washington University School of Law and is of counsel to the St. Louis law firm Bryan Cave."

He was an uncle of politician Knud Christian Knudsen. He finished his secondary education in 1861, graduated with the cand.theol. degree in 1867, and in 1879 he became vicar in the newly established parish of Nedre Eiker. When Nedre Eiker became its own municipality in 1885, he sat in the municipal council and on the school board and was elected mayor. He left Nedre Eiker in 1886, and became a curate in Drammen. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from that city in 1894 and 1897. He was then elected for a third term in 1900 from the constituency Tønsberg, where he had been appointed vicar. On 11 March 1905, when Michelsen's Cabinet assumed office, Knudsen was appointed Norwegian Minister of Education and Church Affairs. This cabinet oversaw the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905. Knudsen left the cabinet on 26 January 1906."

Thereafter, Molloy sat out the remainder of her term as an independent before being defeated at the 2006 state election. The following year, Molloy unsuccessfully contested the federal seat of Wide Bay, also in an independent capacity. In the 2009 state election, she unsuccessfully re-contested Noosa.

He was imprisoned many times during the freedom struggle. He hailed from Shakurpur Village, a yadav dominated village in North-West Delhi. In the post-independence era, Prakash, a member of India's yadav community, served as Minister in charge of Planning and Development as well as the first Chief Minister of Delhi from 1952-55. His stints in the Parliament twice won him accolades as an able parliamentarian. He also made noteworthy contributions as the Union Cabinet Minister for Food, Agriculture, Irrigation and Cooperatives. The cause of depressed sections of the society, rural development and empowerment of the weaker sections were issues which were very close to the heart of Chaudhary Brahm Prakash. He was quick to realise the potential of cooperative societies in mitigating the hardships of the village folks. As early as in 1945, he started organising village and agriculture cooperatives. He was also a proponent of the Panchayati Raj institutions. He organised the National Union of Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Minorities in 1977 to work for the welfare of these weaker sections."

Calvert worked to reassert the Proprietary interest against the privileges of the colonists as set out in the Maryland Charter, and to ease tensions between the Lords Baltimore and their subjects. Religious tension, which had been a source of great division in the colony, was much reduced under his governorship. Captain Calvert was replaced as governor in 1727 by his cousin Benedict Leonard Calvert, though he continued to occupy other colonial offices. He suffered from early senility and died in 1734."

Beginning in January 2009, he was the president of the Chartthaipattana Party. He was the younger brother of Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa. Born at Suphanburi, Chumpol held a Bachelor of Laws from the Thammasat University and an MPA from the Syracuse University. He worked as a civil servant and political science lecturer at the Thammasat University, before he entered politics in 1979. A member of the conservative-populist Thai Nation Party, he represented Suphan Buri Province in parliament. In the following years he held different high-rank government positions. In 1986 and 1992, he was Vice President of the House of Representatives. From 1997 to 1998 he was Minister of Education in Chuan Leekpai's cabinet. As he was no member of the Thai Nation Party's executive board, he was, unlike his brother, not banned from political activity by the Constitutional Court's ruling of 2 December 2008. So he could, as his brother's proxy, become leader of the Chartthaipattana Party, which is the de facto successor of the dissolved Thai Nation Party. After his grouping broke the coalition with the People's Power Party and joined the Democrat-led government, Chumpol became Minister of Tourism and Sports under Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. When the Pheu Thai Party led by Yingluck Shinawatra won the 2011 elections, Chumpol changed sides again, and directed his Chartthaipattana Party into the coalition with Pheu Thai. He kept the Tourism and Sports portfolio and was additionally appointed Deputy Prime Minister, on 9 August 2011. Chumpol Silpa-archa has been decorated with the Special Class of both the Order of the White Elephant and the Order of the Crown of Thailand. Chumpol died of heart failure on 21 January 2013, around 09:30 hours, at Ramathibodi Hospital, while holding the offices of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism and Sports."

Before entering parliament Dr Davis worked as the director of geriatric medicine at The Prince Charles Hospital. He has served as president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association and was the state chair of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. On 13 May 2014, Davis was sacked from Cabinet in response to his speaking against the government on a number of matters. Premier Campbell Newman said Davis had failed to observe the convention that cabinet members and assistant ministers are bound by collective decision making. Although Davis initially stated that he intended to retire at the next state election, he resigned from the Parliament on 23 May 2014. A 2014 Stafford by-election was held on Saturday 19 July 2014. On 25 July 2014, in an interview on the ABC's 7.30 Queensland, Davis stated that he had resigned from the Liberal National Party and had spoken to Australian Labor Party state secretary Anthony Chisholm about the potential for continuing his political career with Labor, potentially running in Newman's seat of Ashgrove. The following day, Leader of the Opposition Annastacia Palaszczuk stated that Davis was not a member of the Labor Party and would not be running as a Labor candidate. On the same day, Davis submitted his application to join the Labor Party, and also stated that he was interested in federal politics if he was unsuccessful in obtaining a state seat."

In 1846, and again in 1847, and in 1851, he was chosen to the State Senate, and thus became ex officio in the two latter terms a member of the Corporation of Yale College.

  "text" : "Dr Bruce Stephen Flegg (born 10 March 1954, in Sydney) is a former Australian politician. He was a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 2004 to 2015, representing the electorate of Moggill in south-western Brisbane for the Liberal Party of Australia and its successor the Liberal National Party. He was the leader of the state Liberal Party from 2006 to 2007 and served as Minister for Housing and Public Works in the Newman government from April to November 2012. Flegg was born in Sydney and was a general practitioner before entering politics. At the 1993 federal election he contested the seat of Dickson which was ultimately delayed to a supplementary election due to the death of a candidate, but was defeated by the Labor candidate, Michael Lavarch. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 2004 state election, replacing former Liberal leader David Watson in the safe Liberal seat of Moggill. He was immediately elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party upon his election, and succeeded Bob Quinn as leader in 2006. He had only been Liberal leader for a number of days when then-Premier Peter Beattie called the 2006 state election, which the conservative parties lost decisively. He faced wide criticism in the wake of the election defeat regarding his performance during the campaign, and faced speculation of a challenge from rival Tim Nicholls. Nicholls was unable to gain sufficient support to oust Flegg in a closely divided caucus, but following ongoing tension, Flegg resigned as leader on 4 December 2007 and was succeeded by compromise candidate Mark McArdle. Flegg was not part of the initial shadow ministry following the merger of the Liberal Party and National Party to form the Liberal National Party in 2008, but was subsequently appointed Shadow Minister for Education in 2009. He was appointed Minister for Housing and Public Works following the party's landslide victory at the 2012 state election; however, he resigned in November following a series of controversies surrounding his ministerial dealings with his lobbyist son and allegations he had moonlighted as a GP while a minister. In October 2014, the LNP State Executive refused to support Dr Flegg's party preselection as a candidate for the January 2015 election, instead choosing to replace him with former AMA President Dr. Christian Rowan. He remained an LNP Member of Parliament until the January 2015 election when he did not re-contest his seat. Before Flegg's disendorsement, Moggill was suggested as a possible safe seat for Premier Campbell Newman to move to from his marginal seat of Ashgrove. He has four sons, one of whom, Jonathon Flegg, ran unsuccessfully for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly beachside seat of Coogee in 2007."

As of 2005, she is the chief of the DAP Malacca women's wing, and also represents the constituency of Kota Laksamana in the State Assembly of Malacca. She is also married to the current Chief Minister of the State of Penang who also the Secretary-General of the DAP, YAB Tuan Lim Guan Eng, and is the daughter-in-law of the former Opposition Leader in the Parliament of Malaysia, Lim Kit Siang, who is also of the DAP. In 2005, she suffered a surprise defeat when running for re-election to the DAP Malacca committee, placing second-last, finishing ahead of only her husband. However, while her husband automatically qualified to sit on the committee by virtue of his position as party Secretary-General, Chew did not. Chew was \"saddened by the results\", but said she accepted her defeat. However, Teresa Kok, a DAP Member of Parliament, suggested there was a conspiracy behind the defeat of Lim and Chew in their re-election campaigns. In 2006, it was reported that Chew would become the first Malacca assemblyman to give birth while in office. At the time, Chew had three children with Lim: Rachael, aged 15, Clint, aged 14, and Marcus, aged 11. In 2008, Chew defeated newcomer Lee Kiat Lee for the Kota Laksamana seat where she had 11043 votes while Lee had only 3801 votes."

Bunten was the first mayor to be elected in Topeka under the new council-manager government, which stripped most of the powers of the office of mayor. Instead, the city council and appointed city manager holds most of the power. As such, Bunten's role is limited to leading city council meetings, promoting economic development, and being the \"ceremonial head\" of the city. He replaced James McClinton as mayor, who did not seek a second term after the powers of the office were reduced. A native Topekan, Bunten was a basketball player while attending Topeka High School. He was a teammate and good friend of Dean Smith, who later went on to fame as a basketball coach at North Carolina. Bunten and Smith both attended the University of Kansas and were members of Phi Gamma Delta social fraternity. After college Bunten entered the US Marine Corps and served in Korea, rising to the rank of Captain. In 2010, Bunten decided to change the name of Topeka to Google in honor of the company Google, Inc. for one day. This was considered a ploy to attract Google to Topeka as a site for a high speed Internet installation. The site eventually was located in Kansas City, Kansas. Bunten has led an effort to improve the downtown area and promoted a plan to raise funds for the development of the area. In 2012, Bill Bunten announced that he would not seek re-election in April 2013 at a City Council meeting."

  "text" : "Bernard \"Berny\" L. Stone (November 24, 1927 – December 22, 2014) was alderman of the 50th Ward of the City of Chicago, Illinois from 1973 to 2011. The 50th Ward encompasses part of Chicago's far North Side and includes the West Ridge, West Rogers Park and Peterson Park neighborhoods. First elected to the Council in 1973, Stone was the second longest-serving alderman (after Edward M. Burke). His tenure spanned the terms of seven Mayors, from Richard J. Daley to Richard M. Daley. Stone was also Vice Mayor of the City of Chicago from 1998 to 2011. Stone was a member of the \"Vrdolyak 29\", which opposed Mayor Harold Washington's agenda. For most of his life a Democrat, Stone followed Alderman Edward Vrdolyak to the Republican Party, and unsuccessfully challenged Carol Moseley Braun for Cook County Recorder of Deeds. Stone was a protagonist in a protracted legal conflict with the neighboring suburb of Evanston in 1993–1994. Employees of Stone's 2007 re-election campaign were convicted of vote fraud in 2010. Stone was \"outspoken\" and \"relished the rough and tumble of politics\"."

The circumstances of his later life and premature death are cited by physicians who believe the overwhelming evidence for the biological etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome. Brynmor John had been diagnosed with the illness, and died suddenly immediately after exiting the House of Commons gym.

  "text" : "William Brian Maginess, QC (10 July 1901 – 16 April 1967) was a member of the Government of Northern Ireland, who was widely seen as a possible successor to Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Born in 1901, the son of a Lisburn solicitor, he was educated at The Wallace High School and Trinity College Dublin from where he graduated with a Law degree (LLD), and was called to the Northern Ireland bar in 1923. Having served in the Royal Corps of Artillery during the Second World War he entered the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1938 when he won the Lisburn-centered seat of Iveagh. He entered the Cabinet of Basil Brooke in 1945 when he became Minister of Labour. His stints as the Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Finance (de facto Deputy Prime Minister) left him favorite to succeed Brooke as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. In the early 1950s however, Maginess became a hate figure for the Orange Order when he banned marches through Catholic areas in Counties Down and Londonderry. Brooke demoted him to the non-Cabinet post of Attorney General in April 1956. While Attorney General, Maginess was party to the case of Attorney General for Northern Ireland v Gallagher [1961] 3 All Er 299, which remains authority in the law of Northern Ireland and England & Wales for the principle that Dutch courage is not a defence in criminal law. Counsel for Gallagher were future Attorney General and Lord Justice, Basil Kelly, and future Stormont MP and Chairman of the Criminal Bar Association in England, Richard Ferguson. In December 1959, Ian Paisley led a demonstration of Ulster Protestant Action members to Stormont Castle to protest at Brooke's refusal to dismiss Maginess and Sir Clarence Graham for making speeches at an Ulster Young Unionist Council event supporting Catholic membership of the Ulster Unionist Party. Having been appointed a King's Counsel in 1946 he was appointed a County Court Judge in 1964 when he resigned from Parliament. He died three years later in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital at age 65. A plaque in his memorial is cited inside the Church of Ireland parish church in Hillsborough, where he is buried."

Robbins was born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, son of Capt. B. Robbins, and educated at the Yarmouth Academy. He arrived in Wellington in 1874, and was a storekeeper in Hawera from 1881. In Hawera he organised a local dairy factory and the National Dairy Association. He was on various local boards; Fire Board (3 years), Hospital Board (chairman 1906-09), and the Wanganui Education Board 1897-1906. His first public service was as a member of the school committee in Hawera for a good decade, where he was chairman for most of that time. He was a member of the Hawera Borough Council for fifteen years and Mayor of Hawera for seven years. Robbins stood in the 1893 election in the Egmont electorate and came second of three candidates. He contested the Hawera electorate in the 1896 and 1905 elections. He came a close second in 1896, and came third in 1905. Robbins moved to Tauranga in 1911, and was Mayor of Tauranga twice, from 1912 to 1915 and 1929 to 1933. He retired from the mayoralty in 1915 and did not contest the election, which was won by Charles MacMillan over John Cuthbert Adams. Robbins stood against the incumbent, William Herries of the Reform Party, in the 1919 election in the Tauranga electorate and was beaten with a margin of over 30% of the vote. He initially declared himself an Independent Progressive Liberal but received the endorsement of Joseph Ward and was the official candidate of the Liberal Party. He was appointed to the Legislative Council by the First Labour Government. He died in January 1953 aged 96 and is buried at the Presbyterian Cemetery on 18th Avenue in Tauranga. He married in 1877 Jane Anne Ross (died 6 March 1950)."

He helped establish Reckitt & Sons, a manufacturer of household goods, as one of Kingston upon Hull’s foremost businesses. His career with the company spanned 61 years—from his initial employment as a confidential and shorthand clerk until his death, as chairman, in 1930. In the House of Commons, Ferens spoke to further the cause of Women's Rights. He supported women's suffrage at home, and repeatedly drew attention to the trafficking of women and girls in the colonies. But never a great orator, and by nature a retiring man, much of his work at Westminster was completed in the committee rooms, away from the limelight. He did not seek re-election after being unseated in acrimonious campaign in 1918. A devout Wesleyan Methodist, Ferens made numerous charitable donations throughout his life. His gifts to Hull include the Ferens Art Gallery and a donation of £250,000 for the establishment of University College (now the University of Hull). He is memorialized in the University's motto: Lampada Ferens. In other parts of the country he made substantial donations to schools, hospitals and charitable organisations."

  "text" : "Thomas Joseph Campbell (14 December 1871 – 3 May 1946), known as \"T. J.\" Campbell, was an Irish politician, barrister, journalist, author and Judge. Campbell was born in Belfast on 14 December 1871. He studied at St Malachy's College and the Royal University of Ireland. He was awarded a BA in 1892, his LL.B in 1894 and an MA in 1897. In 1895, he began editing The Irish News, a local Belfast-based newspaper. In 1899, he was the Chairman of the Ulster District Institute of Journalists. In 1900 Campbell was called to the Irish Bar (King’s Inn) and the English Bar in 1904. In 1918 he was appointed as a King's Counsel. He became a Bencher of King’s Inn in 1924. Campbell was the first Treasurer of the Bar of Northern Ireland and first Secretary of the Circuit of Northern Ireland. A close friend of Joseph Devlin MP, Campbell was a supporter of John Redmond MP and stood for the Irish Parliamentary Party in South Monaghan at the 1918 general election. He lost the election to Sinn Féin's Sean McEntee (then in prison and later Finance Minister in the first De Valera led Government in the Irish Republic). \" A man of markedly moderate views\" **, in 1929 Campbell was appointed to the Senate of Northern Ireland. At the 1931 general election, he stood unsuccessfully for the Nationalist Party in Belfast West. In 1934, he was elected to the Parliament of Northern Ireland in a by-election as Stormont MP for Belfast Central, resigning his seat in the Senate. He was elected unopposed in Belfast Central in the general elections of 1938 and 1945. From 1937, he and Richard Byrne were the only Nationalist Party MPs to regularly attend the Stormont Parliament, and after Byrne's death in 1942, he was a lone voice against abstentionism in his own party. From the Senate in 1931 he successfully introduced the only nationalist sponsored Stormont bill, the Wild Birds Protection Act. Described as an \"old friend and political opponent\" by Lord Craigavon he was chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. Campbell has been described as having a \"Redmondite approach and rigid attachment to attendance and parliamentary etiquette (which) ruled him out as a unifying influence\" on his own party after the death of its leader Devlin. ** Campbell opposed the use of violence to achieve political ends throughout his political career. His book Fifty Years Of Ulster (1941) was mainly about his work as a barrister, but he also predicted the difficulties which would eventually befall the Stormont Parliament: \"If a minority anywhere are to regard themselves as condemned to be in a permanent minority in Parliament with no inducement to tempt ambition or ability into their ranks they will inevitably become discouraged and indifferent. A Parliamentary constitution depends on the continuance of parties and if this factor is eliminated the constitution will of itself cease to exist. Parliamentary government will fall into contempt. The system will collapse\". He said of his attendance at the Stormont Parliament \"I went there of duty, not of desire\". In November 1945, he resigned his Belfast Central seat and retired from politics in order to take up a position as a County Court Judge."

  "text" : "Robert Law McCartney, QC (born 24 April 1936) is a Northern Irish barrister and a former leader of the UK Unionist Party. He was initially a member of the Ulster Unionist Party but was expelled in June 1987 when he refused to withdraw from the general election of that year. He stood against the incumbent Popular Unionist Party MP Sir James Kilfedder in North Down as a \"Real Unionist\" but failed to win the seat. In the 1995 by-election in North Down after the death of Kilfedder he was elected as a \"UK Unionist\" defeating the Ulster Unionist Party candidate. He subsequently established the United Kingdom Unionist Party to contest elections to the Northern Ireland Forum and the related talks which startedin 1996. The other party representatives to the Forum were Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien and Cedric Wilson, a former low-level DUP member in the 1980s. McCartney retained his Westminster seat in the 1997 election. He opposed the subsequent Belfast Agreement in the May 1998 referendum and his party won five seats in the Assembly elections later that year (McCartney himself in North Down, Cedric Wilson in Strangford, Patrick Roche in Lagan Valley, Norman Boyd in South Antrim and Roger Hutchinson East Antrim). However, Wilson, Roche, Boyd and Hutchinson parted company with McCartney in December 1998 because of their leader's so-called 'exit strategy' from the Northern Ireland Assembly in the event of Sinn Féin being allowed seats in the new Northern Ireland Government. McCartney denounced them, saying all four 'were famous in their own living rooms' and that their supporters 'could fit into a telephone box.' In 2008 both Wilson and Boyd attended meetings of Jim Allister's Traditional Unionist Voice. In 1999, Robert McCartney ran for the party in elections to the European Parliament, winning 2.9% of the first preference vote. He lost his Westminster seat in the 2001 election to the UUP candidate Lady Hermon. He was committed to a policy of integration for Northern Ireland, whereby legislative devolution for Northern Ireland would no longer be Westminster's abiding policy, there would be no Stormont legislative assembly and the province would be a fully participating part of the United Kingdom; at the same time the three main British political parties would fully organise in Northern Ireland. He was the president of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1986, and led it in its four years of prominence after the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. McCartney resigned as head of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1988 over a dispute with its executive. These integrationist policies, once popular in some sections of Unionism, receded with the introduction of devolution to Scotland and Wales, and the creation of a functioning Northern Ireland Assembly. However it is the case that other parts of the United Kingdom with devolved assemblies are fully covered by the three main British political parties, but not in Northern Ireland. McCartney also strongly opposed the St Andrews Agreement and in 2007 stood on an anti-agreement ticket in six different constituencies. He lost his own seat in North Down, polling 1,806 first preference votes (5.9% of the total, and less than half the quota required to be elected). He also obtained 360 votes (1.2%) in Belfast North, 388 votes (0.8%) in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, 853 votes (2.0%) in Lagan Valley, 893 votes (2.3%) in South Antrim and 220 votes (0.5%) in West Tyrone He claims to have retired from politics following the loss of his seat in the 2007 Assembly Election to Brian Wilson of the Green Party. However, he still occasionally makes media appearances and writes newspaper articles and in October 2009, Robert McCartney was guest speaker at the Traditional Unionist Voice party conference in Belfast, where he spoke on the situation surrounding the primary school transfer test, brought about by a Sinn Féin Education Minister."

In 1898, he won election to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on a moderate \"Liberal-Labour\" platform. He ran for Vancouver's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1900 federal election. Reports vary on whether he ran as an Independent Labour-Liberal candidate defeating the official Liberal and Conservative candidates, but once elected, he joined the Liberal caucus. He was re-elected in the 1904 and 1908 elections as a Liberal. He was defeated in the 1911 election. Smith subsequently returned to provincial politics and, returned to the provincial legislature in the 1916 provincial election that brought the British Columbia Liberal Party to power. Smith served as Minister of Finance in the government of Premier Harlan Carey Brewster, and died in office on February 17, 1917. His wife, Mary Ellen Smith, succeeded him in the subsequent by-election (held January 1918) as an Independent Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). She subsequently became the first female cabinet minister in the British Empire. Ralph Smith was a supporter of women's suffrage, which was enacted in the province shortly after the Liberals came to power after ten previous attempts over the years had failed."

He was the leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in Nova Scotia from 1945 until 1953. He succeeded Donald MacDonald as the party's leader, after MacDonald lost his seat in the 1945 general election.He represented the electoral district (riding) of Cape Breton East in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1945 until 1956. Due to the Conservatives not electing a single member to the Assembly, Cunningham became the leader of the Official Opposition during the 44th General Assembly of Nova Scotia.

  "text" : "Robert Anthony Furolo (born 27 July 1969) is an Australian politician. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 2008 to 2015, representing the electorate of Lakemba. Furolo was born in Sydney, and grew up in its outer western suburbs. He worked in the transport industry after leaving school, working as a McDonalds manager for a period, before returning to university to study economics and industrial relations. He was appointed as an advisor to his local MLA, member for Hurstville and future Premier Morris Iemma in 1994. He worked for Iemma for nine years, remaining on his staff after his appointment as a minister in 1999, before leaving to work as a public relations consultant in 2003. Furolo was elected to the City of Canterbury council in 1999, and served a stint as its deputy mayor before standing for mayor in the 2004 election. He won that election, and was re-elected in 2008, recording one of the few swings to the Labor Party in an election where the party faced widespread losses across the state. One week before his re-election as mayor, on 5 September 2008, Iemma resigned as Premier, resulting in widespread speculation that he would resign as the member for Lakemba. After delaying an announcement for two weeks, Iemma announced on 19 September that he would indeed retire; a move reportedly attributed to his efforts to see Furolo, his preferred choice, endorsed as his successor. Furolo subsequently won Labor preselection for what had been Labor's safest seat in the state, and easily won the seat, polling more than 58% of the primary vote, despite a 15-point swing against Labor. He was sworn in as a member of the Legislative Assembly on 18 October, and as a member of the Legislative Review Committee on 30 October. In October 2010, Furolo borrowed a Lamborghini (reportedly valued at $400,000) from local businessmen, \"the Kazzi brothers\", for the purposes of a \"joyride\". Furolo slightly damaged the vehicle but was unhurt. No other vehicles were involved in the accident and no one was hurt."

In 1964 he moved to Edmonton to work on a graduate program, completing a Ph.D. in sociology in 1973. He taught at York University for one year (1968–69) before returning to the University of Alberta, where he taught for 27 years until his retirement in 1996. He is Professor Emeritus at the University of Alberta. He entered provincial politics in 1997 when he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the riding of Edmonton-Strathcona. Raj became leader in February 2000 after the previous leader, Pam Barrett, retired from politics. Pannu ran a high-profile campaign in the 2001 Alberta election. T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan \"Raj Against the Machine\", as well as a reputation as a \"likeable and honest politician\" contributed to his popularity and made him a leader well respected by supporters and non-supporters alike. He announced on July 13, 2004 that he was resigning as party leader. Fellow MLA Brian Mason, the deputy leader, became interim leader. Mason was formally elected leader in a leadership convention held on September 18. However, he sought re-election as an MLA in the 26th Alberta general election, and was re-elected by a wide margin. On June 14, 2006, he announced his retirement from Alberta politics at the dissolution of the legislature, which took place in February 2008."

  "text" : "Raymond Alexander \"Ray\" Stevens (born 1 February 1953) is an Australian politician who is the Leader of Opposition Business in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. Born in Townsville, Stevens is married with two children. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Finance and Economics from James Cook University and Macquarie University, and was admitted to the Australian Association of Accountants in 1974, being employed by Price Waterhouse in Sydney. He returned to the family station, \"Doncaster\" in Richmond, before moving to the Gold Coast in 1979. He ran local businesses in the area and was a councillor on Albert Shire Council from 1988 to 1994, serving as Mayor in 1994. After the amalgamation of Albert and Gold Coast, he was mayor of the latter from 1995 to 1997. Stevens, as member of the Liberal Party, was elected to state parliament in 2006 as the member for Robina, succeeding former state Liberal leader Bob Quinn. At this time he was also appointed as the Shadow Minister for Public Works and Housing from 2006–2009, with a brief stint from 2007–2008 as the Shadow Minister for Information and Communication Technology. In 2008, Stevens joined the new Liberal National Party with the rest of his party. The redistribution ahead of the 2009 state election renamed his seat to Mermaid Beach; he was re-elected. And from 2009–2010 he was the Shadow Minister for Tourism and Fair trading, before he continued in that role as the Shadow Minister for Tourism and Racing from 2010–2011. From early 2011 until the election in 2012 Stevens was the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Racing. With the Liberal National Party winning the 2012 Election, Stevens became the Leader of the House of Queensland and in October 2012 the Assistant Minister to the Premier on e-government. On 11 September 2012, Stevens sparked racism claims after using the term \"Jihad Jackie\" in Parliament to describe opposition spokeswoman Jackie Trad (herself of Catholic-Lebanese heritage). While Stevens withdrew the remark in Parliament upon urging by house speaker, he staunchly maintained using the word Jihad to describe someone of Arabic heritage, on 11 September, was nothing he needed to apologise for. He subsequently said Trad needed to \"harden up\" and had a \"glass jaw\". At a pre-polling booth on 21 January 2015, Stevens was filmed having a bizarre reaction to a journalist asking him questions about a $100 million sky rail project from Mudgeeraba to Springbrook. Stevens had previously stated he had approval from the Integrity Commissioner, but when the journalist asked Stevens for the Commissioner's advice to be released, Stevens refused to answer. When the journalist did not back down and asked how much he could make from the development, Mr Stevens then began to wave his hands and arms up and down in the journalist's face. \"That Mermaid Ray really lost the plot, but without saying a word,\" Donovan said.\"He started doing a dance and gyrating around — this is a Minister of the Crown, we're talking about, let me remind you.\""

  "text" : "Sir Richard Nagle (1636 – 6 April 1699) was an Irish politician and lawyer. He held the positions of Attorney-General for Ireland, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, Lord Justice of Ireland and Secretary of State and War for Ireland under King James II. He fled to France in 1691, joining James II at Saint Germain, where he resumed his duties as nominal Secretary of State and War. He later served as Commissioner of the Household. Richard was born into an Old English family at Carrigacunna Castle, in County Cork, the son of James Nagle of Annakissy, and James' wife, Honora Nugent. This was his family's seat. His brother Pierce was a future High Sheriff of Cork. Although Richard was initially destined to join the clergy, he was educated in law at Gray's Inn and was called to the bar in Dublin. \"Active and skillful\", he had a successful career as a lawyer. The Earl of Tyrconnell brought Richard to England with him in 1685 to meet James II. James created him Attorney-General for Ireland and knighted him in 1686. He also appointed him to the Privy Council of Ireland. As an MP for Cork, Nagle was elected Speaker by the Irish House of Commons in 1689. This parliament is known to posterity as the \"Patriot Parliament\". It spurned the outcome of the Glorious Revolution, recognising King James's divine right to the Irish crown over William of Orange's parliamentary one. William, made King of England during the revolution, was set on conquering Ireland from James, and to achieve that end he launched the Williamite War. Richard was diametrically opposed to the Act of Settlement 1662 (he was the author of A Letter from Coventry, an anti-settlement pamphlet), which had punished royalists and Catholics who had fought against parliament in the Civil Wars; he unsuccessfully advocated its repeal in this session. James's forces were routed by William's at the Battle of the Boyne, in 1690; King James retreated to Dublin. It was here he convened a council that advised him to flee to France. Nagle was one of its members. They reasoned that if he did not leave \"he would run a great risk of being taken by the enemy\". James followed their advice. Nagle, accompanied by Tyrconnell, visited him at his court-in-exile, Saint Germain, at the end of 1690. In Nagle's absence, his duties as Secretary of State were executed by the Baron Nugent of Riverston. Upon the death of Tyrconnell, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Nagle became one of the Lords Justice of Ireland. The others were Francis Plowden and Baron Fitton of Gawsworth. They administered what remained of Jacobite Ireland in the place of the Lord Lieutenant, though they did not assume command of the armed forces. Sir Richard Nagle married Jane (Joan) O'Kearney on September 19, 1669 at Clonbrogan, Ireland. Jane's sister, Mary O'Kearney, married Sir Richard's brother, Pierce Nagle of Annakissy, the high sheriff of County Cork in 1689."

He served in the Cabinet of Mike Harcourt as Minister of Municipal Affairs, Minister of Government Services and the Minister Responsible for Sport and the Commonwealth Games. He was forced out of office due to a number of sexual harassment complaints, which resulted in Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision on the scope of section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and on the administrative law principle of natural justice. Due to delays to the tribunal hearings the claims were not resolved for 30 months after the first filing in 1995. During this time Blencoe was subjected to vast media coverage that led to the end of his political career, and contributed to his and his family's social and psychological hardship. The Supreme Court of Canada rejected Blencoe's argument that the delay warranted a stay of the human rights complaint. Following this decision, the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal issued its decision on the original sexual harassment complaint. The Tribunal found that Mr. Blencoe had engaged in conduct towards an employee which was sexual in nature and unwelcome, and that this conduct had a negative work-related impact on the employee. The Tribunal issued a declaration that Mr. Blencoe not engage in similar activity in the future an ordered that he pay $5000 to the former employee."

He represented Vancouver City in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1900 to 1909 as a Conservative. He was born in Scarva, the son of John Garnett Tatlow and Anne Matthews, and was educated in Cheltenham. After completing his schooling, Tatlow came to Montreal where he was hired by the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company and later a brokerage office. He joined the militia and came to Victoria in 1879 to inspect the coastal defences there. Tatlow remained there as instructor to the local militia and custodian for artillery supplies. The following year, he was hired as private secretary to the lieutenant governor, Albert Norton Richards. He continued in the same function for Richards' successor, Clement Francis Cornwall. Tatlow resigned that post in 1886 and moved to Vancouver where he was a real estate, insurance and mining broker. He was a member of the city's park committee from 1888 to 1905 and served as chairman from 1895 to 1903. In 1893, he married Elizabeth Mary Cambie. Tatlow ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1890 and 1894 before being elected in 1900. He introduced a private member's bill requiring all immigrants to be able to write in a European language. Tatlow served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Finance and Agriculture and as Commissioner of Lands and Works. He also served as deputy premier. He resigned his seat in October 1909 after Richard McBride proposed guarantees to help finance the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway. Tatlow died in Victoria at the age of 54 after being ejected from his carriage. Mount Tatlow was named in his honour."

One of 5 boys, Brothers - Don, was a pilot and shot down in WWII, John Fiske, Fred Fiske, Leon Fiske, (and 2 sisters who died at birth), Fiske was born in Clarence, Nova Scotia and graduated from high school in Annapolis, Nova Scotia. Growing up on a wood mill run by his father, he began his business career working in the bank. Later to become an entrepreneur, businessman, restaurateur, and motel/hotel owner/operator. He married Claire Longley of Bridgetown, Nova Scotia and has three children, Heather, Alan and Shari. Fiske entered provincial politics in the 1970 election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Donald R. MacLeod by 434 votes in Pictou Centre. On October 28, 1970, Fiske was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Provincial Secretary and Minister of Trade and Industry. On July 15, 1971, Gerald Regan shuffled his cabinet, moving Fiske to Minister of Development. He remained as Provincial Secretary until another shuffle in November 1971. Fiske resigned from cabinet prior to an August 1973 cabinet shuffle, and did not seek re-election in 1974. He later served as Chairman of the Nova Scotia Gaming Commission. Although forced to resign due to indiscretions between the Halifax Casino and the government at the time, his claims were found to be truthful. \"When Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation's former chairman Ralph Fiske's wrongful dismissal suit went to trial last May, one canny Halifax lawyer voiced surprise that Fiske planned to call only two witnesses: himself and former finance minister Bill Gillis. Arrayed against him were seventeen members of Nova Scotia's political, bureaucratic, and legal establishment: former premiers, cabinet ministers, and deputy ministers from the premier's office; officials of the gaming corporation; and a clutch of Liberal lawyers from the province's best-connected law firms. Yesterday, Fiske touched home plate in near total victory. Gruchy found that political interference in the gaming corporation's administration of the Sheraton Casino project rendered Fiske's position untenable and forced him to resign. Nova Scotian's should celebrate this moment, rare in our recent history, when a lone civil servant proved that courage and integrity can overcome the mediocrity that corrupts governance in this province. When future civil servants are forced to choose between doing the right thing and the politically easy thing, Fiske's example will beckon them toward duty\""

Seeking a political comeback, Quary supported Seth Sothel's takeover of the Governor's office in 1690, and was appointed Chief Justice. In 1692, Sothel was forced from office, and Quary fled South Carolina for Philadelphia, where he came under the protection of Maryland Gov. Francis Nicholson. The Navigation Act of 1696 created admiralty courts, and Quary was appointed Judge of the Admiralty for the southern colonies, from Pennsylvania southward. In 1701, Robert Quary was commissioned as Surveyor General of the Customs for New Jersey and Pennsylvania; in 1703 this appointment was expanded to include all of British America. In this position he served simultaneously on the Provincial Councils of five colonies: Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Robert Quary died in Virginia in October 1712."

For over 10 years, he was the Senior Opposition Critic for Natural Resources and was a Deputy Whip of the Official Opposition. He was the Chair of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy, and Ethics, but health reasons made Chatters retire at the 2006 election. In May 1996, he was suspended from the Reform Party caucus for asserting, in the wake of the Delwin Vriend case on LGBT human rights, that schools should have the right to fire openly gay teachers. Another caucus colleague who had made a similar comment, Bob Ringma, was suspended at the same time; a third caucus colleague, Jan Brown, was also suspended at the same time for publicly criticizing Chatters and Ringma. All three were readmitted to the Reform caucus by September of that year. He died at the age of 69 on January 25, 2016. He had pancreatic cancer."

He was the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory under chief minister Adam Giles from 2013 to 2014. Tollner was born in Biloela, Queensland, and worked as a manager and company director before entering politics. He contested the 1997 territory election as an independent, narrowly losing to CLP candidate Chris Lugg in the seat of Nelson. He subsequently won the new federal seat of Solomon for the CLP at the 2001 federal election, and was re-elected at the 2004 election. He was narrowly defeated by Labor candidate Damian Hale at the 2007 election. Tollner then contested the 2008 territory election, winning the new seat of Fong Lim and defeating Labor minister Matthew Bonson. He was re-elected at the 2012 election, and upon the CLP's victory was appointed Minister for Health, Minister for Alcohol Rehabilitation and Policy, and Minister for Housing. In March 2013, Mills expelled Tollner from his cabinet after a heated disagreement between the two at a party meeting. According to former MLA Daryl Manzie, Tollner swore at Mills and threw a stack of cabinet papers at him before walking out of the room. Tollner was appointed deputy chief minister of the Northern Territory on 13 March 2013. He caused controversy in August 2014 when he referred to the gay son of fellow CLP MP Gary Higgins as a \"pillow biter\" and \"shirt lifter\". As a result, it was announced that Tollner's resignation as deputy leader of the CLP had been accepted. Despite that, Tollner said a few days later that he wanted to be restored to his former position or he would quit the party, leaving it in a precarious position on the floor of the Legislative Assembly. On 1 September, Chief Minister Adam Giles threw open the leadership and deputy leadership to a party room ballot. Giles was re-elected as CLP leader, and Peter Chandler was voted in as his deputy. A redistribution ahead of the 2016 election all but erased Tollner's majority in Fong Lim, slashing it from a fairly safe 7.3 percent to an extremely marginal 0.2 percent. Tollner tried to transfer to the newly created seat of Spillett, which had absorbed much of the eastern portion of Fong Lim. However, he lost a November 2015 preselection battle to Lia Finocchiaro, the member for neighbouring Drysdale. His senior advisor, Tim Dixon, was pre-selected for Fong Lim, but lost the seat to Labor."

  "text" : "Donald J. Atchison is a Canadian politician who was elected mayor of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on October 22, 2003. He won a close four-way contest, running on a platform that included being tough on crime, freezing property taxes, and resuming control of the city's police commission. He was re-elected as mayor in 2006, 2009 and 2012. At the end of his current term in 2016, he will become the longest-serving mayor in Saskatoon's history at 13 years. Prior to being mayor, Atchison was first elected to Saskatoon's city council as a councillor for Ward 10 in 1994, and was re-elected in 1997 and 2000. As a city councillor, Atchison suggested a part of downtown Saskatoon should be enclosed by a $80 million 10-storey climate-controlled glass atrium, dubbed the \"Atreos.\" He also is known to be precise about his dress, as he owns a men's clothing store. On his first election as mayor, he required citizens visiting the Mayor's office to be formally dressed, a policy that was soon dropped after being criticized. Both points were ridiculed by CBC satirist Rick Mercer who sponsored an online contest that went on to name Atchison \"Canada's Craziest Mayor.\""

She was first elected to Ottawa city council in 1982 in a surprise victory over veteran alderman Joe Cassey. On city council, her priorities include housing, urban planning, community development, transportation, social services, women's issues and social justice causes. As a previous head of Heritage Ottawa she worked to preserve heritage structures. She was easily re-elected in 1985 and 1988. She considered a bid for the mayoralty in 1991, but ended up supporting fellow progressive Nancy Smith who came in a strong second (36%) to Jacquelin Holzman (40%). Holmes was easily re-elected to council in 1991. In 1994 Holmes moved to the council of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, facing little opposition in her bid. She was acclaimed in 1998 and retired from council in 2000 when the regional municipality was abolished and replaced with the new amalgamated City of Ottawa. In 2003 she returned to city council, winning another convincing victory in her previous ward. Holmes was similarly re-elected in 2006. Holmes supported a bylaw to require property owners to promptly remove graffiti. Holmes was re-elected in 2011."

He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Robert Newton Lowery and Social Democrat Herman Saltzmann in Winnipeg North \"B\". The Conservatives won a majority government in this election, and McLean served as a backbench supporter of Rodmond P. Roblin's administration. In 1915, the Roblin administration was forced to resign from office after a report commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor found the government guilty of corruption in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. A new election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. McLean did not seek re-election. During World War I, McLean served overseas as commander of the 101st Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. From 1918 to 1919, he served on Headquarters Staff for Military Division No. 10. From 1919 to 1921, he was commander of the Winnipeg Light Infantry (10th Battalion). He attempted to return to the legislature in the 1922 provincial election. By this time, the city of Winnipeg had been re-designed as a single ten-member constituency, with members chosen by a single transferable ballot. McLean finished in 24th place on the first count with 515 votes, and was eliminated on the twenty-first count. He served as mayor of Winnipeg in 1928-29, succeeding fellow Conservative Ralph Humphreys Webb. He was defeated by Webb when he ran for reelection as mayor for 1930. He died in Winnipeg at the age of 82."

He was the first Democrat elected Erie County Executive and the first Erie County Executive elected to three four-year terms. Gorski was an Erie County Legislator and a member of the New York State Assembly prior to three-term service as county executive. During his second term as County Executive, he ran for Congress to succeed Democrat Henry Nowak, but he was defeated in the general election by Republican Jack Quinn. Like many Buffalo Democrats, including Buffalo Mayors Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, Gorski was known for being more conservative than the mainstream Democratic Party platform, and was regularly cross-endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York. As county executive, he rivaled his contemporary Buffalo Mayors and on some issues his contemporary New York State Governors in power: He succeeded in bringing the World University Games to Buffalo, and since the National Football League Buffalo Bills play in suburban Orchard Park, New York it was his responsibility to broker a deal to keep the team from leaving town. He also helped the National Hockey League Buffalo Sabres finance Marine Midland Arena (now known as First Niagara Center). During his early years he brought about economic recovery and kept the county on solid financial footing during his tenure. He has been described as the only County Executive to balance the budget. Gorski is a Vietnam War veteran and remained active in Veteran's affairs while in office. Since leaving the county executive's office, he has worked in private business in Buffalo, New York. Gorski spent his first nine years of public life working for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) and was subsequently was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo."

He obtained an undergraduate and graduate degree from the University of British Columbia in political science and public administration, returning to the Williams Lake area, where he became a cattle rancher and a practitioner of horse logging. He was also active as a consultant in various federal, provincial, and First Nations projects related to public policy and economic development. Zirnhelt began his political career when he served as a director of the Cariboo Regional District from 1974 to 1977. In 1987, he was elected as a trustee of the Cariboo-Chilcotin School District. Zirnhelt made the leap to provincial politics in 1989, winning the seat of Cariboo in a by-election for the social democratic British Columbia New Democratic Party. The riding had, until then, been a stronghold of the conservative British Columbia Social Credit Party for almost forty years. Zirnhelt would go on to be re-elected in 1991 and 1996 in the riding of Cariboo South (the old Cariboo riding was abolished with the 1991 election). With the election of a New Democratic government in 1991, Premier Mike Harcourt appointed Zirnhelt Minister of Economic Development, Small Business and Trade. He later served as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food. Following Harcourt's resignation, Premier Glen Clark appointed Zirnhelt Minister of Forests — a powerful portfolio in a province where forestry is a major economic sector. In that position, Zirnhelt initiated an intensive review of the province's forest practices, as concerns mounted over the logging of old growth forests and the insufficient restocking of logged areas by timber companies. Zirnhelt failed in his attempt at re-election in 2001."

He became involved in a land dispute involving the authority of the laws from the Provisional Government with Josiah Lamberson Parrish. Lownsdale would defend the matter in court in a case that would make its way through the Oregon Supreme Court and to the United States Supreme Court in Lownsdale v. Parrish, 62 U.S. 290 (1858).

Jones ran as an independent candidate, however, and defeated Dumaresque in the general election. She later joined the Liberal caucus. He later served as John Efford's campaign manager in the party's leadership convention in 2001. He subsequently threatened to sue the victorious candidate, Roger Grimes, for libel after Grimes reportedly stated that he \"would never be able to sleep any one night in comfort, knowing he had a minister in confidence who had Danny Dumaresque as an advisor to him.\" He also served as president of the provincial Liberal Party from 2006 until 2009. He was succeeded in this role by Judy Morrow. Dumaresque ran as the Liberal candidate in Torngat Mountains in the 2007 election, but lost to Patty Pottle. He was also frequently rumoured as a possible candidate for the leadership of the provincial Liberal party in their 2010 leadership election. After he had previously stated that he would not rule it out, on July 29, 2010 he announced he would not run and would instead focus on his business career.

He was an unsuccessful candidate in the leadership election to replace Yvonne Jones in August 2011. On July 2, 2013 Dumaresque announced he was running for the leadership of the provincial Liberal Party in their 2013 election. He was, again, ultimately unsuccessful in his bid to lead the party. Dumaresque ran for the Liberal nomination in Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair for the 2015 provincial election but lost to Lisa Dempster.

Warnock worked as a journalist with the Perth Daily News, and as a radio broadcaster with 720 ABC Perth, 6PR and 6NR. She was elected to the State Parliament as the Member for Perth in 1993, succeeding Dr Ian Alexander who had retired. She was re-elected in 1996 but did not contest the February 2001 election. Her political career was entirely from the opposition bench, during the premiership of Richard Court. Warnock served as Opposition whip, spokesperson for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs and the Arts and spokesperson for Women's Interests and Racing & Gaming. She also served as President of the State Parliamentary Labor Party. In 1996, Warnock and upper house MP Cheryl Davenport steered a controversial pro-choice bill through the parliament—the \"Acts Amendment (Abortion) Bill\", which effectively decriminalised abortion and enabled women to access abortions of pregnancies up to 20 weeks on the basis of informed consent. In 1999 she was named the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies. As of 2013, she is the current patron of the Friends of Perth International Arts Festival. Warnock was married to local novelist, playwright and arts patron Bill Warnock, who died in 2001."

  "text" : "Dennis Pennington (May 18, 1776 – September 2, 1854) was a farmer and a stonemason who became known for his many years in public office as an early legislator in the Indiana Territory and in Indiana's General Assembly as a representative of Harrison County, Indiana. Pennington, a member of the Whig Party, became the first speaker of the Indiana territorial legislature's lower house in 1810, served as the territory's census enumerator in 1815, and represented Harrison County as one of its five delegates to the constitutional convention of 1816. Pennington was the first speaker of the Indiana Senate (1816 to 1818), and served in the state legislature for eighteen years, which included five years in the Indiana House of Representatives and thirteen years in the Indiana Senate. His major political contributions relate to his strong opposition to slavery. Pennington ran unsuccessfully for Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1825. In addition to his service in the state legislature, Penning was a Harrison County sheriff and a justice of the peace, a trustee of Indiana University, and a member of the Grand Lodge of Indiana. He also supervised construction of the limestone courthouse that served as Indiana's first state capitol building in Corydon, Indiana. The historic Old Capitol, the seat of state government from 1816 to 1825, is one of his most enduring legacies. Fondly remembered as \"Old Uncle Dennis\" or \"Father Pennington,\" he was known for his common sense and strong character and became one of Harrison County's most influential citizens."

MacInnis defeated Gillis again in a rematch almost a year later in the 1958 general election, known as the \"Diefenbaker Sweep.\" MacInnis remained a Member of Parliament throughout the 1960s and early 1970s except for the 25th Parliament when he was defeated in the riding by Malcolm Vic MacInnis of the New Democratic Party in the 1962 election. Since the 1968 election, MacInnis represented Cape Breton—East Richmond, one of the ridings which replaced the Cape Breton South electoral district in a boundary realignment. After his term in the 29th Parliament ended in 1974, MacInnis left national office and did not campaign for another term. From 1988, MacInnis served as the final Mayor of Glace Bay, a municipality which was dissolved in 1995 and replaced by the Cape Breton Regional Municipality."

Later, O'Connor travelled north where he founded the town of Temagami and opened Lady Evelyn Hotel, the Temagami Inn and Ronnoco Hotel. When O'Connor moved to Temagami, he was hoping to find some mineral prospects. In 1899, O'Connor created test pits in east-central Strathy Township that later became Big Dan Mine, which is named after him. Other mines in Temagami that bare his name are Little Dan at Arsenic Lake and O'Connor near Lake Temagami. O'Connor continued to move northwards where he discovered deposits of gold. On March 30, 1933, O'Connor died in the city of Timmins where he was living with his family. The cause of his death was bronchopneumonia."

As a resident of The Beaches, she became an activist in the campaign against the Scarborough Expressway, and ran for municipal office in the 1972 election, defeating incumbent councillor Tom Wardle. She was one of several progressive reform candidates, including Elizabeth Eayrs, Michael Goldrick, Colin Vaughan, Dan Heap, Karl Jaffary, Reid Scott, John Sewell and Anne Johnston, who were elected alongside mayor David Crombie. Thomas was re-elected in the 1974 election, but was defeated in the 1976 election by Tom Wardle, Jr., the son of the councillor she had defeated in 1972. She ran again in the 1980 election, defeating Wardle, and served until the 1985 election, when she was defeated by Paul Christie. Thomas and council colleague Dale Martin made national headlines in 1985 when, while attending a Federation of Canadian Municipalities conference in Calgary, they got into a war of words with Calgary mayor Ralph Klein about how ugly and poorly planned they perceived the city to be; Thomas was also quoted as calling Calgary City Hall an \"abomination\". Both Thomas and Martin later apologized for the comments. Following her electoral defeat, Thomas was appointed head of Metro Toronto's licensing commission, and continued to serve on the Toronto Licensing Commission until 2003. In 1996, she coauthored a report investigating problems with the city's process for licensing taxis. She also remained an active member of the New Democratic Party.

Dickieson was raised in New Glasgow on a small family farm. He graduated from the University of Prince Edward Island with his B.Sc. in 1979 and received a B.Ed. in 1982. Dickieson taught high school in Calgary, Alberta for one year before entering medical school at Dalhousie University, from which he graduated with his medical degree in 1987. Dickieson interned in New Brunswick and in Prince Edward Island and established a family medicine practise in O'Leary. Dickieson was elected leader of the Island New Democrats in March 1995, and led the party in the 1996 and 2000 provincial elections, seeking to be a Member of the Legislature for District 25, West Point-Bloomfield. He was successful in the 1996 election, but was defeated in the 2000 election. Dickieson led the party through the 1990s, but resigned two years after his personal electoral defeat. Dickieson was a popular politician during his term, even among non-New Democrats, as a voice for change. He was pressured by many members to run for the federal New Democratic Party in the 2004 federal election and again provincially, he had refused until he announced on September 12, 2014 that he would seek the NDP nomination for Egmont for the 2015 federal election. Dickieson was nominated as the candidate in October 2014. On October 19, 2015, Dickieson was defeated in the election, finishing third behind the winner, Liberal Bobby Morrissey and Conservative incumbent Gail Shea. Dickieson was always involved in local and provincial issues, including concern over the closing of rural post offices, the fate of farmers, and the quality of education, particularly among children. He has served on boards for the promotion of a community youth centre, as a Chamber of Commerce board of directors, and as Chief of Medical Staff at the Community Hospital. He is also currently the Past President of the Medical Society of Prince Edward Island. He resides with his wife Kathleen and family in Howlan."

He was acting vicar in Brevik from January to July 1879, and then worked in Skien until 1887, except for the years 1881 to 1886 when he was a sailors' padre in North Shields. In 1887 he became vicar in Brevik on a permanent basis. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament from the city in 1895 and 1898. In 1900 he became vicar in Eidanger. On 22 October 1903, when the second cabinet Hagerup assumed office, Hauge was appointed Norwegian Minister of Education and Church Affairs. The cabinet resigned on 10 March 1905 as a part of the build-up for the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden; Hauge did not retain the job. He did not return to Eidanger either, instead he became vicar in Skien. He changed job to dean in 1918, and retired in 1924. Hauge was appointed a Knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav and a Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog."

  "text" : "Heath Nelson Macquarrie (September 18, 1919 – January 2, 2002) was a Canadian politician, teacher, scholar, and writer. Macquarrie described himself as a Red Tory, using the term in the title of his autobiography Red Tory Blues. During the October Crisis of 1970, he agonized over the implementation of the War Measures Act, and was prepared to vote against it, but relented for the sake of keeping the Tory caucus united behind Robert Stanfield. Writing in retrospect, Macquarrie described his vote in favour of the Act as \"fundamentally wrong\". He was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1957 federal election that brought John Diefenbaker to power. He served as a member of parliament for twenty-two consecutive years, until he was elevated to the Canadian Senate in 1979 on the advice of Joe Clark. He sat in the upper house for a further fifteen years, retiring at the mandatory age of 75 in 1994. He was publicly loyal to Clark's successor, Brian Mulroney, but privately disagreed with the government on several occasions, once saying during a caucus meeting, \"You know, a lot of people think I have a prominent nose because of my enjoyment of a certain beverage. Well, that's all nonsense. I got it that way by having to hold it so often while voting for some of Mulroney's bills.\" Macquarrie remained active following his retirement from the Senate in 1994, by contributing a column to the Hill Times and to newspapers in his home province of Prince Edward Island. Macquarrie was educated at Prince of Wales College, the University of Manitoba, the University of New Brunswick and McGill University. He studied for his doctorate at McGill, choosing for his thesis topic Robert Borden. He lectured at Brandon University and at Mount Allison University, in economics, political science and international relations. He edited and wrote the introduction to the published edition of Sir Robert Borden's diaries. An admirer of the World War I-era prime minister, Macquarrie considered Borden to be the architect of Canadian independence."

He was also a director for the Saskatchewan section of the United Farmers of Canada. Kemper was elected during the Saskatchewan general election, 1934, representing Gull Lake as a member of the Farmer-Labour Group (FLG). The FLG was founded in 1932. In 1935, it changed its name and officially became the Saskatchewan section of the national Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF. During the eighth provincial election on June 19, 1934, the FLG had five elected members come to office, including Kemper. He was defeated when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in Gull Lake in 1938 and in the Maple Creek federal riding in 1940. In 1953, Kemper sold his farm and retired to the town of Shaunavon. He died in a car accident near Tompkins while travelling to a CCF rally."

She was appointed Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development in March 2011. Chong was the BC Liberal MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head. She was first elected in 1996 and was re-elected in 2001, 2005, and 2009. Born and raised in Victoria, British Columbia, Chong began her political career in 1993 as a municipal councillor for the District of Saanich. She ran her own accounting firm with business partner Karen Kesteloo and is a fellow of the Certified General Accountant of BC (FCGA). She was awarded a CGA-BC lifetime membership in September 2014. On September 18, 2014, Chong announced her intention to run for mayor of the City of Victoria in the November 2014 municipal election which she subsequently lost, coming a distant third to new mayor, Lisa Helps and previous mayor Dean Fortin. While Chong lost badly, it was widely speculated that she knew she could not win but instead wanted to ensure previous mayor Fortin, who ran a campaign primarily with backing of the New Democratic Party (NDP), would not win. Chong successfully set the ballot question based on Fortin's mishandling of the Johnson Street Bridge Replacement Project but simply did not have enough voters to make an impact. Fortin ultimately lost to Helps by a mere 89 votes. While Chong's running in a known left-wing municipal election after a long and successful career as a Provincial Cabinet Minister was baffling to many, the speculation is that Chong knew she could pull votes from the moderate Fortin, with a long-term strategy to strengthen the Green/Progressive vote in the region and province thus weakening the New Democratic Party by splitting the leftist vote."

Macdonald, who joined the Labor Party in 1972, had his membership of the party terminated in 2013 for bringing the party into disrepute. After the Independent Commission Against Corruption found that Macdonald acted in a corrupt manner, in November 2014 it was announced that following advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions, Macdonald will be prosecuted for the offence of misconduct in public office for corruptly issuing of lucrative mining licences at Doyles Creek in the Hunter Valley."

  "text" : "Isiah \"Ike\" Leggett (born July 25, 1944) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Maryland, currently serving as the executive of Montgomery County, Maryland. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Born in Deweyville, Texas, Leggett attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and, after serving in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Army, earned a law degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1986, he became the first African-American elected to the county council in Montgomery County, Maryland and served on the council through 2002. He remains the only African-American ever elected to that body at-large. For two years, Leggett served as the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party before leaving that position to run for office once again. Leggett was elected County Executive of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office. Since taking office, Leggett has worked to put the County’s fiscal house in order while strengthening critical County services in education and public safety, and helping the most vulnerable. In the four years before Leggett took office, County spending grew by over 40 percent. In his first five years in office, Montgomery County's spending was held to zero percent. Responding to the worldwide recession that hit in 2008, Leggett closed budget gaps of over $2.6 billion, eliminating 10 percent of County government positions, while imposing furloughs (including himself), wage freezes, and changes in retirement and health benefits to save the County money. At the same time, Leggett put tens of millions of dollars into building and preserving thousands of units of affordable housing in the County, establishing a CountyStat office to ensure “real time” performance of County services, and set up a multi-agency Positive Youth Development Initiative to ensure positive programs for at-risk youth. Leggett worked to strengthen Montgomery County's biotechnology and life sciences sectors and also established the \"311\" Customer Service as a single point of entry via phone and the internet for residents seeking County services. During Leggett's first eight years, serious crime went down in the County by 24 percent and the Fire and Rescue Service's response times to Montgomery County's fires improved dramatically. Leggett was reelected to a second term in 2010 and to a third four-year term in 2014."

He then changed his civil job to that of surveyor of customs and excise. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1836, 1839, 1842, 1845, 1848, 1851 and 1854, representing the constituency of Arendal og Grimstad. In October 1854 he was appointed Minister of Church and Education, succeeding Jørgen Herman Vogt. In September 1855 he left that succeeded Vogt again, this time as Minister of Finance and Customs. He held this position periodically until June 1863, interrupted by spells as member of the Council of State Division in Stockholm from 1 June 1856 to 31 July 1857, 1 September 1858 to 30 September 1859 and 1 September 1861 to 31 August 1862. Otto Vincent Lange was married to Anne Nicoline Aall (1800–1886), daughter of businessperson, politician and historian Jacob Aall. The Aall family was a notable one; Anne Nicoline Aall's grandfather was businessman Nicolai Benjamin Aall (died 1798) and her uncles were politicians Niels and Jørgen Aall. Also, Otto Vincent Lange had a brother Ulrik Frederik Lange who was an educator and five-term member of Parliament. Otto Vincent's sister Barbara Abigael married Even Hanssen, whose son Johan Jørgen Lange Hanssen married Otto Vincent's daughter Lovise Jacobine. Otto Vincent Lange was proclaimed Knight of the Order of St. Olav 1847, promoted to Commander in 1857, and in 1863 was awarded the Grand Cross in 1863. He was awarded two Swedish orders: the Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star and Knight of the Order of Vasa. Lange also held the first class (equivalent to Grand Cross) of the Ottoman Mecidi Order. He died in 1870 in Kristiania and was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund."

  "text" : "Olav Meisdalshagen (17 March 1903 – 21 November 1959) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party best known for serving as the Norwegian Minister of Finance from December 1947 to November 1951 and as the Norwegian Minister of Agriculture from January 1955 to May 1956. He was also a Member of Parliament for a long time, being elected for the first time in parliamentary election of 1936 and serving until his death, except for the period between 1940 and 1945 when the Parliament of Norway was de facto defunct due to the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. His death in 1959 came halfway through his fifth term in Parliament, and shortly after a parliamentary speech. A jurist by profession, Meisdalshagen came from a humble family background, growing up at a former crofter's farm in rural Nord-Aurdal, and losing his father in the 1920s. After studying he moved back to Nord-Aurdal, worked as an attorney and built the Labour Party organization in the region. The background formed him in that his main political goal was to improve the economy of dwellers in rural farming districts. He was a proponent of economic regulation, which marked his period as Minister of Finance. However, his period was also marked by the dominance of Erik Brofoss and the Ministry of Trade in deciding the country's overall financial policy. When Trygve Bratteli succeeded Meisdalshagen as Minister of Finance, the ministry regained its dominance, but also set out on a gradual deregulation. This, in addition to Meisdalshagen's discontent with increased spendings on defence, made him an oppositional figure within the Labour Party. He did return briefly to cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, and also cooperated with the government through the position as chairman of Norges Kooperative Landsforening, a national association of consumer co-operatives. However his oppositional tendencies grew stronger in his later life. He was a part of the \"Easter Uprising\" in 1958, and in 1958 and 1959 there were rumours of Meisdalshagen worked behind the scene to facilitate a change of personnel—and policy—in the Labour Party. His death came in this period."

She was previously a long-standing leading figure in the informal parliamentary Opposition to Young Vivian's government. She was, from 2008 to 2011, Minister of Health, Minister of Public Works, Minister of Women’s Affairs, and Minister in charge of the Niue Power Corporation. She had previously been Minister of Education, Health, Environment, Training and Development. Additionally, Jacobsen is a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and Patroness of the Niuean Volleyball Association. Following the 1999 general election, she was a candidate for the post of Premier (head of government), who is selected by the national Assembly. She lost to Sani Lakatani, of the Niue People's Party, by six votes to fourteen. Following the 2005 general election, Jacobsen was Young Vivian's only opponent contending for the position of Premier. She was defeated by three votes to seventeen. Vivian thanked her for competing against him: \"That the selection was contested, thanks to Ekepule [member of the Assembly] O’love Jacobsen, confirms our determination under the Westminster system of government to adhere and uphold one of the fundamental principles of democracy.\" In February 2008, Jacobsen stated that landowners had been bullied into authorising the building of a hotel and golf course on their land, a project supported by the government and funded by Chinese investors. Premier Young Vivian rejected the allegation. In the lead-up to the 2008 general election, which saw her successfully retain her seat in the Assembly (as a common roll representative, Jacobsen was critical of the fact that several members of the Assembly would be re-elected unopposed. She accused Vivian of discouraging people from taking part in the election as Opposition candidates, and argued that a democracy requires voters being able to choose between several candidates in each constituency. \"If the principle of democracy is going to be upheld, then it is very important that people do need to go to the polls and not have them unopposed and become duly elected.\" Vivian rejected Jacobsen's criticism, and argued in return that candidates were chosen within the villages, in traditional ways. With such a practice, he said, \"there is no conflict, there’s peace and togetherness.\" A government news publication stated with thinly veiled criticism that Jacobsen \"saw herself as a self-appointed backbench champion of the masses\". Following the election, Jacobsen supported Toke Talagi's candidacy to prime ministership, against Vivian, and was appointed to Talagi's small Cabinet. In March 2011, she resigned from government and from the Assembly to be appointed Niue's High Commissioner to New Zealand."

Troxler ran for the post of North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture in 2000, losing to Meg Scott Phipps; he ran again for the same position in the 2004 Council of State election, finishing only 2,000 votes ahead of incumbent Democrat Britt Cobb. However, because over 4,000 votes were lost in Carteret County, the race was unresolved for over three months. After extended legal battles between Cobb and Troxler, Cobb conceded the race on February 4, 2005. Troxler was sworn in as North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner on February 8, 2005, a month after the rest of the Council of State, becoming the first Republican Agriculture Commissioner in the state's history. After his inauguration at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds, Troxler rode a tractor to his downtown offices. Steve Troxler was elected in 2008 to serve another term as Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services for the state of North Carolina. In 2012 he was elected to a third term. There has been some controversy regarding his stance on legally carried firearms at the NC State Fair. Opponents like to point out that he promised police escorts for attendees to get to their cars safely, but none were provided."

The first Commissioner to actually reside in the Northwest Territories, he was a leader in the construction of a semiautonomous, responsible self-government run by residents of the territory. He was appointed as a Citizenship Judge in British Columbia in December 1997 and served until 2005 Hodgson was one of the founders of the Arctic Winter Games - which began in Yellowknife in 1970 for athletes from Alaska, Yukon, and the NWT – and which now also include Greenland, parts of Arctic Russia, as well as Northern Alberta and Nunavik (Northern Quebec), and the new territory Nunavut which was formed from NWT in 1999. He was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada on December 18, 1970for his service to labour and government. Subsequently he received the Queen's commemorative medals for her silver, golden, and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012);as well as the Canada 125 medal in 1992. When rapid changes in socio-economic conditions threatened the continuity of Inuit oral history, Commissioner Hodgson urged the taping of elders' stories. In 1974, the residents of Pangnirtung (since then becoming part of Nunavut) presented the Commissioner with eleven stories which were later compiled into a book. Hodgson was nicknamed \"Umingmak\" by the Inuit. For his services in the NWT, he was presented the public service's Outstanding Achievement Award in 1976. From 1942 to 1945 he served with the Royal Canadian Navy on convoy duty in the North Atlantic for which he received the 1939-1945 Star, Atlantic Star and other World War II medals. From 1979 to 1981 he was Canadian co-chairman of the U.S.-Canadian International Joint Commission. He was recruited by Premier William R. Bennett of British Columbia to run BC Ferries for a time in the 1980s. He was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of the BC Transit in 1985. Hodgson died on December 18, 2015."

On September 20, 1867, he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons as the first member to represent the riding of Guysborough. He was re-elected for a second term on October 12, 1872, but was defeated in an election on January 22, 1874. Having been opposed to Nova Scotia's entry into the Confederation of Canada in 1860s debates, he remained a member of the Anti-Confederation Party through his first year in office, which was in favour of reversing the decision to join the Confederation. In September 1868 he joined the Liberal-Conservative Party when the Anti-Confederation Party began to collapse, the first MP in Canadian history to cross the floor of Parliament. Spending his last years as a court county judge, he died on February 20, 1885."

His father, the late Mr. Jaffer Ali was a Paper mache artist and businessman. Sadiq Ali graduated from Aligarh Muslim University and earned his MA in Political Science. He has given some important recommendations about the solution of the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. His self-rule report has been widely applauded in both India and Pakistan and his recommendations have been regarded as one of the most workable solutions of this issue. He has also written a comprehensive paper on the deteriorating conditions of the forests of Jammu and Kashmir State; he has further submitted an indepth research paper outlining how the Dal Lake may be saved from further degradation. Mr Sadiq Ali entered politics at a very young age, and was one of the closest associates of Sheikh Abdullah, the founder of National Conference. He was nominated to the State Legislative Council numerous times. He also held the position of treasurer of the JKNC for 23 years. He quit National Conference stating personal reasons, although he never spoke against the NC party or its principles. There was widespread speculation that the only reason Mr Sadiq Ali quit NC was because of the NC leadership's inadequate action against a rival from within NC, whom Mr Sadiq had accused of sabotaging his re-election bid from Zadibal. On March 9, 2008, Farooq Abdullah, the patron of NC, announced to the media that Mr Sadiq Ali had rejoined the party and would be handling the state affairs of the party."

He served as the NDP critic for aboriginal issues in both parliaments and as the critic for community and rural development for a time during the 39th Parliament. He assigned to the Select Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs in both Parliaments but the committee was not convened. In the 38th Parliament of British Columbia, he introduced the Promotion of Safe Antifreeze Act, 2007 which sought to ban ethylene glycol from antifreeze products due to its toxic effects on animals. It only received first reading but was followed by the implementation of a regulation which required the addition of a foul-tasting agent to antifreeze. He sat on the Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture which studied economic and environmental effects of fish farms and delivered recommendations to the Legislative Assembly. In the 39th Parliament, he introduced the Cave Protection Act, 2010 which proposed to create a registry of all cave sites and create legal protection for them. He sat on the Special Committee on Cosmetic Pesticides which studied the potential for regulations for cosmetic pesticide use. During the 2011 NDP leadership election, Fraser endorsed John Horgan, though Adrian Dix went on to win and replace Carole James as leader of the BC NDP. Prior to becoming an MLA, Fraser served one term (1996–1999) as mayor of Tofino, British Columbia. Prior to being mayor he operated a bed and breakfast. After serving as mayor he worked as a manager at a shellfish farm. He had also stood for election during the 2004 federal election, as the New Democratic Party nominee in the Nanaimo—Alberni electoral district. However, he lost to the incumbent James Lunney of the Conservative Party."

Representing the British Columbia New Democratic Party, he won the October 29, 2008, by-election in the electoral district of Vancouver-Burrard. He was re-elected to the Legislature, this time in the newly created riding of Vancouver-West End in the May 13, 2009 general election. Chandra Herbert's BC NDP formed the Official Opposition in both the 38th and 39th Parliaments and he was assigned to be the party's critic on tourism, arts and culture. He has introduced several pieces of legislation as private members' bills, though none have been adopted. The Long Term Tenants Protection Act, and his more comprehensive Residential Tenancy Amendment Act, were meant to address evictions and high rent increases that were occurring in the West End. He also introduced the Consumer Protection in Ticket Sales Act, 2009 which would have made ticket scalping illegal and the Gender Identity and Expression Human Rights Recognition Act which would have included gender identity and gender expression into the BC Human Rights Code as characteristic protected from discrimination. He entered the 38th Parliament at age 27, as its youngest Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and remained the youngest throughout the 39th Parliament. Prior to becoming a MLA, he was elected to the Vancouver Parks Board. He served as a Parks Commissioner between 2005 and 2008 and was then a member of the Coalition of Progressive Electors. On the Parks Board he voted against removing the requirement for a referendum on an expansion of the Vancouver Aquarium but later voted in favour of the expansion. He advocate for bicycle valet service at large public events, investigating environmentally friendly means of disposing of animal waste, and implementing a zero-net-loss of greenspace policy. He is openly gay and married his partner, Romi Chandra, in March 2010. Afterwards, he legally changed his name to Spencer Chandra Herbert. Both Spencer and Romi have been active supporting causes within the LGBT community. At the provincial level, Chandra Herbert has advocated for a community victim services worker in Davie Village, a specialized telephone line for people to call to report incidents involving gay-bashing or verbal and physical assaults, and for school boards to include LGBT issues, especially in anti-bullying lessons."

  "text" : "Stan Bunn (born June 25, 1946) is an American politician and lawyer in the U.S. state of Oregon. Born and raised in Yamhill County, he is part of a political family that includes his brother Jim Bunn who served in Congress. A self-described moderate Republican, Stan served in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly, including a successful run for the Oregon House of Representatives while in law school in 1972. Later he served as Oregon Superintendent of Public Instruction from 1999 to 2003, in a political career spanning four decades. In non-elective offices, he was chairman of the state's ethics commission and on the Oregon Traffic Safety Commission between stints in the legislature. Bunn also made unsuccessful attempts to be elected as Oregon Attorney General in 1976 and to serve in Congress representing Oregon’s first congressional district in 1996, when his brother was running for re-election in the neighboring Congressional district. Bunn faced scrutiny over back taxes while Superintendent of Public Instruction and also was accused of committing over one thousand ethics violations by the Oregon Government Ethics Commission, stemming primarily from the use of a state car and use of a state cell phone for personal use. Bunn challenged their findings and later reached a settlement in which he did not admit wrongdoing and paid $25,000 to the Commission in a payment that could not be called a fine."

He supported, assisted and nurtured a number of institutions, particularly in Mumbai and enriched the city culturally. He was the Member of Parliament from Bombay when it was part of the unified Bombay State. He was a Union Minister during the time of Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shashtri and Indira Gandhi. Though a three-time MP, he was defeated by George Fernandes in Mumbai South (Lok Sabha constituency) in 1967 for 4th Lok Sabha. He then fought a by-poll from Banaskantha in Gujarat and rejoined Lok Sabha. In 1969 he left Congress of Indira Gandhi with senior leaders like Morarji Desai and Nijalingappa. He contested from Banaskantha Lok Sabha seat in 1971 on Congress (O) ticket but lost to the Congress candidate. In the Lok Sabha discussions on the report of the States Reorganisation Commission, on 15 November 1955, Patil demanded that the Bombay city be constituted as an autonomous city-state, laying great stress on its cosmopolitan character. However, Bombay state was partitioned into the present day states of Gujarat and Maharashtra in 1960, and the city of Bombay (now called Mumbai) became the capital of Maharashtra."

  "text" : "(For those of a similar name, see Susan Davis (disambiguation).) Susan Margaret Davies (born 14 March 1954) is a former Australian politician. She was born in Mirboo North, Victoria, to parents Richard Llewellyn (dec) and Jean Margaret Davies (dec). She attended Leongatha High School (1966–70) and Watsonia High School in 1971, when she completed her Higher School Certificate. She received a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education in 1976 from Latrobe University. She subsequently became a secondary school teacher, and began farming in addition to this in 1989. Davies joined the Australian Labor Party in 1993, as part of the rural protest against Kennett government funding and service cuts, and was the Labor candidate for Gippsland West in the 1996 Victorian state election. Sitting Liberal MP Alan Brown resigned less than a year after the state election, precipitating a by-election. Labor declined to stand a candidate for this very safe Liberal seat; it and its predecessors had been in the hands of a conservative party for more than a century and a half. Davies resigned from the Labor Party and contested the by-election as an independent, emerging victorious. She retained her seat in the 1999 state election, and held the balance of power with two other rural Independents when a significant, mostly rural, and very anti-Kennett-government swing led to a hung parliament. Davies played a key role in developing the \"Independents' Charter\", which the three independents used as a basis for backing Steve Bracks and the Labor Party as the new minority government. She served on the Public Accounts and Estimates committee during the following parliamentary term. Prior to the 2002 election, Gippsland West was essentially replaced by the newly created seat of Bass, which was notionally Liberal in a traditional matchup. Davies contested Bass, but lost to the Liberal candidate, former MLC Ken Smith. She later rejoined the Labor Party and contested the 2004 federal election as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of La Trobe. She was defeated by the Liberal candidate, Jason Wood. Davies now runs a small farm in South Gippsland, is part of a local food producers' network and Korumburra Landcare, and is a director on several organisations, including Chairing Energy Innovation Co-operative Ltd, which promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency measures as a response to climate change and peak oil."

He first fought MLA election in 1993 from Pilani and won as an independent candidate. In 2008 Legislative Assembly Elections, he changed his constituency from Pilani to Surajgarh due to Reservation of Pilani Seat. He again won from Surajgarh beating Bhartiya Janta Party Candidate Santosh Ahlawat over a margin of nearly 8000 Votes.

  "text" : "Sarah Mitchell (née Johnston) (born 10 May 1982) is an Australian politician. She has been a The Nationals member of the New South Wales Legislative Council since March 2011. Mitchell was born in Gunnedah, and moved to Grafton as a child. She moved back to Gunnedah while in high school, graduating from Gunnedah High School in 1999. She moved to Sydney in 2001, and studied politics and international relations at the University of New South Wales. Mitchell later moved back to Gunnedah, where she worked as an electorate officer for former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson. She continued working for Mark Coulton, Anderson's successor as local MP, upon Anderson's 2007 retirement. She was later elected president of the federal Young Nationals and chairman of the state Young Nationals, positions which she held until her election to parliament. She was preselected for the eleventh position on the Coalition Legislative Council ticket for the 2011 state election in April 2010; while normally unwinnable, the near-record size of the Coalition's victory saw her emerge victorious for the last seat in an extremely close race with far-right independent Pauline Hanson. She married Anthony Mitchell in April 2011, and took her husband's name; she had been elected two weeks before under her maiden name of Johnston. She has served on several standing and select committees, and currently sits on the General Purpose Standing Committee No. 3. During her first years in Parliament, Sarah chaired the General Purpose Standing Committee No. 4, which undertook an inquiry into medicinal cannabis, resulting in a report unanimously in favour of the provision of medicinal cannabis for the terminally ill. Sarah is currently the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional and Rural Health and Western NSW, and was appointed to this portfolio on 24 April 2015."

  "text" : "Stephen J. McCormick (1828–1891) was a prominent printer and publisher in Oregon, United States, who served as mayor of Portland, Oregon, from 1859–1860. He was originally from Dublin, Ireland. He worked as a newspaper reporter in New York. He came to Portland with his wife in 1851. In Oregon, McCormick worked as a printer and publisher. In 1852, he opened a book shop in Portland, the Franklin Book Store. He began publishing a semi-weekly newspaper, The Portland Commercial, on March 24, 1853, but it was discontinued after a short life. He was elected as a Multnomah County delegate to the Oregon Constitutional Convention, held in 1857. He also served on the county commission and school board. He became a prominent publisher in Oregon, and his publications included the Oregon Almanac (originally known as McCormick's Almanac), Oregon Monthly Magazine, a city directory for Portland, and Abigail Scott Duniway's Captain Gray's Company (1859). In 1857, he was elected chief of the Portland Fire Department (established in 1854), serving for a brief period. He was elected mayor of Portland in April 1859, for a one-year term. During and after his term as mayor, he continued working in his main occupation, publishing. On May 13, 1859, he established another Portland newspaper, the Portland Daily Advertiser, which was only the second daily newspaper in the Pacific Northwest (the first being the Portland Daily News, which began publication less than four weeks before McCormick's Advertiser). It ceased publication – a suspension that became permanent – in October 1862. McCormick sold the paper before the start of the Civil War in 1861, the same year that The Oregonian became a daily paper. The Advertiser was pro-slavery and, according to a 1911 account by Henry Pittock, it took a pro-secession stance after the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President in March 1861, causing the paper to lose influence in Portland, where the majority of residents were pro-Union. It ceased publication the following year. McCormick subsequently moved to San Francisco, California, where he became editor of the Catholic Monitor newspaper. In 1889, he wrote the book, The Pope and Ireland. He died in San Francisco in 1891."

He was the first person to hold the post and was elected on 15 November 2012 as an Independent. He received 47,632 first preference votes from an electorate of nearly 1.5 million on a turnout of 14.6% at the PCC Election in 2012. Hayes is the chairman of Hampshire and Isle of Wight Crimestoppers and is a former chairman of the Hampshire Police Authority. In Hayes' previous role as Chairman of the Police Authority he was also a Conservative councillor on both Hampshire County Council and New Forest District Council. He was also the Conservative candidate for Mid Dorset and North Poole in 2005.Hayes is now one of the minority Independent PCCs country and as such has no party-political affiliations. In May 2013, Hampshire's PCC was identified by a House of Commons Select Committee as 'being responsible for the largest increase in the budget to run the PCC's office'. According to Hampshire Police the most of a £2 million budget increase went to meet the PCC Policing and Community Priorities. In December 2013 the Hampshire PCC announced further staff; appointing more Commissioners (one Deputy and two Assistants). Hayes faced accusations that he lives in Earls Barton, Northamptonshire, where his wife is vicar of All Saints' Church. However, the IPCC was satisfied that he lived in Hampshire."

  "text" : "Michael Edward Woodin (6 November 1965 – 9 July 2004) was the Principal Speaker of the Green Party of England and Wales and a city councillor for Oxford from 1994 to 2004. He was Principal Speaker for six of the eight years between 1998 and 2004, firstly alongside Jean Lambert before her election as an MEP, then alongside Margaret Wright, and lastly with Caroline Lucas MEP. He was educated at Gravesend Grammar School, Victoria University of Manchester, and Wolfson College, Oxford. He was Lecturer in Psychology at Balliol College. Woodin was one of the first Green Party city councillors elected in England and was Leader of the Green Party Group on Oxford City Council. He stood for the Green party in Oxford West and Abingdon in the 1992, 1997, and 2001 general elections. He was listed as Green Party's second candidate in South East England for the European Parliament elections in 1999 and 2004 after Caroline Lucas. Woodin and Lucas co-authored the book Green Alternatives to Globalisation: A Manifesto, and a booklet against the single currency Euro: The Euro or a Sustainable Future for Britain?. Woodin died in 2004 of secondary cancer of the lungs, despite being a lifelong non-smoker and keen observant of healthy living. At his funeral, his coffin was towed by bicycle through the streets of Oxford, in accordance with his wishes for the event to be car-free. His early death was considered a tragedy for the resurgent Green movement in the United Kingdom."

Walker was first elected in the ward in 1982. He is viewed as an independent and has never sided with the left or right factions on the city council. His reluctance to choose sides has meant that he has rarely been appointed to important city committees. It was not until the 2003 term of office that he was appointed chair of the Administration Committee. A long-time advocate of campaign finance reform, Walker is also known for being one of only two Toronto City Councillors who did not accept corporate donations."

  "text" : "Mark C. Poloncarz (born November 7, 1967) is the county executive of Erie County, New York. Poloncarz, a Democrat, was elected county executive on November 8, 2011 after defeating the incumbent county executive Chris Collins a Republican by a 53 - 47 percentage point margin. Poloncarz was re-elected on November 3, 2015 with 66% of the vote when he easily defeated the Republican candidate Raymond Walter (33% of the vote) and Green Party candidate Eric Jones (1% of the vote). Poloncarz is only the 2nd Democrat to be elected to the position of county executive in the 51-year history of the position. Entering 2015 Poloncarz was heavily favored to be re-elected county executive; however it was expected he would face a Republican challenge from one of three candidates: incumbent county clerk and former New York Secretary of State Christopher Jacobs, incumbent county comptroller Stefan Mychajliw, or legislator Ed Rath, the grandson of the first Erie County Executive Edward Rath. In the end, all three individuals decided not to run and Walter was chosen by the Republicans. Unlike 2015, when Poloncarz entered the race in May 2011 he was a heavy underdog. However, by focusing on issues of providing efficient, yet cost-effective government, reducing waste, fraud and abuse of the public's tax dollars, supporting the \"People's Mandates,\" and properly funding libraries and arts and cultural institutions, Poloncarz was able to chip away a sizable Collins lead until he won in surprisingly easy fashion. Poloncarz also capitalized on his \"son of a steelworker\" blue collar background against Collins self-proclaimed businessman style. Since taking office as Erie County Executive, Poloncarz worked to change the culture of Erie County government and return it to its core mission: provide the programs and services that residents and taxpayers demand as effectively and efficiently as possible. And as such, he made it a priority to restore funding for what he calls the “People’s Mandates,” which include the rodent control program, parks improvements, road and bridge construction, libraries, summer youth programming and a renewed commitment to arts and cultural organizations. These programs were restored by Poloncarz in a fiscally responsible manner without raising taxes. As evidence of the fiscal stewardship, in 2014, Standard & Poor’s upgraded the county’s credit rating three steps to “AA-” and in 2015 Fitch Ratings upgraded the county's credit rating to \"A+.\" In early 2015, Poloncarz released “Initiatives for a Stronger Community,” his health and human services plan for Erie County. The plan included 49 separate initiatives to address issues of poverty throughout the county, including issues facing the City of Buffalo, which was identified as the 3rd poorest city in America when Poloncarz took office in 2012. Poloncarz also shepherded a pay equity policy through the Erie County Industrial Development Agency requiring all applicants for tax incentives to agree to a policy to provide salary data to the agency to prove they do in fact pay women equally. In 2015, Poloncarz also worked with the county legislature to pass a budget for 2016 that reduced the county's property tax rate from $4.99 to $4.96 per thousand of assessed value, the second year in a row the county's tax rate was reduced. 2014 was a significant year for the Poloncarz administration, including working with the legislature to pass a balanced budget with a small tax cut, opening the Erie County Health Mall, signing an executive order requiring that all contractors with Erie County comply with equal pay laws for women, restructuring the Department of Social Services to address issues with the Division of Child Protective Services, and managing the emergency response to four major weather-related events: two blizzards, flooding in West Seneca and the worst storm to hit the region in nearly 40 years: Winter Storm Knife a/k/a Snowvember Storm. In 2013, Poloncarz announced his “Initiatives for a Smart Economy,” which represents his administration’s commitment to a comprehensive, innovative approach to economic development and provides the “missing link,” tying a host of diverse initiatives into one regional development effort. Specifically, this plan includes a total of 64 initiatives across a dozen areas, representing the economic gears that, working together, will help drive our economic future. More than half of these Initiatives are complete and showing results around Erie County. In fact, since Poloncarz took office as county executive in January, 2012, more than 16,000 new private sector jobs have been created in the Buffalo-Niagara Metropolitan Area, and the county's unemployment rate has dropped from 8.9% in January, 2012 to 4.7% as of December, 2015. Additionally, Poloncarz has stated the key to his administration’s success is to create strong partnerships with other levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors, educational institutions and community groups. Examples include the creation of one of New York State’s first Land Banks, the establishment of the Erie County Medicaid Anti-Fraud Unit, as well as the successful negotiation of a new 10-year lease with the Buffalo Bills that is fair for local and state taxpayers and kept the team in Buffalo following the death of the team's owner Ralph Wilson Jr. At the time Poloncarz ran for county executive in 2011 he was the elected county comptroller in Erie County. Poloncarz was first elected comptroller in 2005 and was re-elected in 2009 in a three-person race by defeating Republican Phil Kadet and Independence Party candidate Michael Abramo by a 52 - 45 - 3 percentage point margin, respectively. Prior to being elected comptroller Poloncarz was an American business and finance lawyer residing in Buffalo, New York. Poloncarz was first elected county comptroller on a platform of restoring fiscal stability and accountability to the county by acting as the taxpayers \"watchdog.\" He is the first comptroller to be elected after a state control board was created and imposed over the county to oversee county finances. While he was the endorsed candidate of the county Democratic party, he defeated 2 challengers in the primary and then a Republican in the general election. Poloncarz has a bachelor's degree from the University at Buffalo and a law degree from the University of Toledo. Poloncarz was the 2003 - 2004 Buffalo and western New York coordinator and spokesman for the John Kerry presidential campaign. He was an at large district delegate for John Kerry at the 2004 Democratic National Convention and to Hillary Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Poloncarz was the founder and first president of the WNY Coalition for Progress, a progressive think tank in upstate New York which today is known as the Western New York Democrats for Progress."

  "text" : "Marguerite Alice \"Missy\" LeHand (September 13, 1898 – July 31, 1944) was private secretary to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) for 21 years. According to Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, during FDR's presidency, LeHand became \"the most celebrated private secretary in the country\". Born into a poor Irish-American family in New York, LeHand attended secretarial school, took a series of clerical jobs, and eventually began to work for the Democratic Party's New York office. There she came to the attention of FDR's wife Eleanor during his 1920 vice presidential candidacy and was hired as FDR's personal secretary. After FDR was partially paralyzed by polio, LeHand became his daily companion, to the extent of adopting his favorite hobbies, games, and drinks. She remained his secretary when he became Governor of New York in 1929 and when he became president in 1933, serving until a 1941 stroke left her unable to speak. She moved to her sister's home in Boston and died in 1944. The exact nature of LeHand's relationship with FDR is debated by historians. It is generally accepted that their relationship contained a romantic element, though scholars remain divided on whether the pair had a sexual relationship. LeHand was engaged to U.S. Ambassador William Bullitt in 1933, but never married, later asking a friend, \"How could anyone ever come up to FDR?\""

  "text" : "Michael Joseph O'Halloran (20 August 1933 – 29 November 1999) was a British politician. He was brought up in County Clare, Ireland, and, finding no employment, he \"drifted to London\" in 1948, aged 15, and worked as a railwayman until he entered politics. He was elected Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Islington North in a by-election in 1969 following the death of sitting MP Gerry Reynolds. He had previously been the secretary of the Constituency Labour Party. His selection over Keith Kyle was the subject of an investigation in the early 1970s by The Sunday Times newspaper. They highlighted his background with a local building company and the local Irish community and questioned the propriety of the tactics of his supporters during his selection as candidate. Regarding Northern Ireland he was staunchly pro-Nationalist and anti-Partition. In his 14 years in parliament, O'Halloran only contributed twice to parliamentary debates. O'Halloran was among the Labour MPs who defected to the new Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981. However, in 1983, the SDP chose John Grant, the MP for Islington Central (which was being abolished in boundary changes), to be its candidate in Islington North. O'Halloran left the SDP to stand as an independent Labour candidate in the 1983 general election. The official Labour candidate Jeremy Corbyn won while O'Halloran came in fourth with 11% of the vote. Grant came third with 22% of the vote. He retired to County Wexford with his wife, and lived there until his death at age 66."

  "text" : "Lieutenant Colonel Sir Michael Frederick Bruxner KBE, DSO, JP (25 March 1882 – 28 March 1970) was an Australian politician and soldier, serving for many years as Leader of the Country Party and its predecessors. Born in Tabulum in Northern New South Wales, Bruxner was educated at The Armidale School and started studies at University of Sydney but later dropped out to take up employment as a grazier and station agent in Tenterfield. After serving in the Citizen Military Forces from 1911, Bruxner enlisted into the Australian Light Horse upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Serving with distinction in Gallipoli, Egypt and Palestine, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Returning to Australia in 1919, Bruxner sold his business and joined the Progressive Party, being elected to the Parliament of New South Wales for Northern Tablelands at the 1920 election. Bruxner came to political prominence when he led the rural \"True Blues\" faction of the Progressive Party that went against their Leader's decision to form a coalition in Sir George Fuller's short-lived government in 1921. Bruxner emerged as the leader of the reduced Progressive Party, which consisted of the members of his faction, but they nevertheless joined with Fuller's Nationalists to form government in 1922. Bruxner also became involved in the New England New State Movement. Bruxner resigned the party leadership, now for the renamed Country Party, at the end of 1925. At the 1927 election, with the abandonment of proportional representation, he won the new seat of Tenterfield unopposed. Bruxner was included in new Premier Thomas Bavin's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, which included the responsibility for transport. He served until Labor won the 1930 election. In April 1932 Bruxner was elected again as the new party Country Party Leader, which he would hold continuously until 1958. When Sir Philip Game dismissed Jack Lang and called upon the Leader of the Opposition Bertram Stevens to form a caretaker government in 1932, Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Bruxner was also sworn in as Minister for Transport and briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio. Bruxner also worked with his long-time friend and Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish the New England University College in 1938, which was later to become the University of New England. Bruxner was central in ensuring Alexander Mair became Premier after Stevens was defeated in the house in August 1939. The Coalition lost government at the 10 May 1941 election and Bruxner would never again serve in government. The rest of Bruxner's parliamentary career was to be on the opposition benches, leading the Country Party through five more elections and through the instability of the larger opposition parties that eventually united as the Liberal Party of Australia. On 6 May 1958, Bruxner formally resigned as Leader of the Country Party, having served continuously in that role since 1932. He continued to serve in his capacity as Member for Tenterfield for one more term before retiring from politics before the 1962 election. Bruxner was Knighted as a KBE in 1962 and thereafter served in various capacities on boards and continued his passion for horses before his death aged 88 on 28 March 1970."

He then worked as a salesman for a bakery in Sydney, Nova Scotia, forming a union and becoming its president. MacDonald was also involved in the co-operative movement helping to found the Reserves Mines Credit Union and serving as its vice-president. He served as a member of the Reserve Mines Volunteer Fire Department for over 60 years having helped found it in 1934. In the 1945 provincial election, he was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly representing the Nova Scotia Co-operative Commonwealth Federation for Cape Breton Centre. He and CCF leader Russell Cunningham were the only two Opposition members in the legislature until the 1949 provincial election. He would remain a member of the assembly for 18 years. MacDonald served as leader of the CCF from 1953 to 1963 leading the party through the 1956 and 1960 provincial election. Despite the fact that the party received almost 9% of the vote in 1960, MacDonald was the only CCFer returned either time. He stepped down as leader in 1963 and James H. Aitchison became leader of the newly formed Nova Scotia NDP. MacDonald lost his seat in the 1963 provincial election and the NDP would not gain another seat in the House of Assembly until 1970. MacDonald also continued his union work as business agent for the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers from 1957 until his retirement in 1975 and was involved with the Cape Breton Labour Council and the Nova Scotia Federation of Labour. He also became active in municipal politics serving on the Cape Breton County Council from 1974 to 1976."

  "text" : "Maurice Lamoureux is a former politician in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. He was an alderman for several years, and served as mayor of Sudbury from 1981 to 1982. Lamoureux was an office supervisor at Falconbridge Ltd. in private life. He retired in 1992, and later worked as a real estate representative with Coldwell Banker Marsh Real Estate. He was first elected as an alderman in the municipal election of 1964. He was twice defeated for the provincial New Democratic Party nomination, and later joined the Progressive Conservative Party. He was chosen as deputy mayor by council in 1978, and became acting mayor in 1981 when Jim Gordon suspended his duties to run for the provincial legislature. Gordon was elected to the legislature in the 1981 provincial election, and members of Sudbury City Council chose Lamoureux as his replacement on March 30, 1981. His only opponent, Sterling Campbell, withdrew before voting took place. Newspaper reports indicate that council declined to hold a by-election, even though almost twenty months remained in Gordon's two-year term. Lamoureux was chosen as mayor at a time of hostile relations between Sudbury City Council and the Sudbury Regional Council. He opposed a round of layoffs at Inco in 1982, and called on local businesses to support striking workers. Lamoureux brought forward what he described as a \"severe attrition policy\" in 1982, cutting 19 jobs to save $500,000 at city hall. Several senior bureaucrats were demoted, and many chose to resign. One of the bureaucrats to lose his job was city engineer Peter Wong, who later challenged Lamoureux for the mayoral position. Wong argued that it was inconsistent for Lamoureux to target the city's high unemployment rate while simultaneously cutting municipal jobs. On election day, Wong defeated Lamoureux for the mayor's position. Lamoureux was later re-elected to city council. In 1987, he argued that the city was losing money from selling surplus land at less than the assessed value. He criticized the federal government's cuts to unemployment insurance in 1989, arguing that it would devastate Sudbury's economy. Lamoureux campaigned for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1993 federal election as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party, and finished third against Liberal incumbent Diane Marleau. In 2000, he was appointed by provincial Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Tony Clement to a transitional board to amalgamate Sudbury and its neighbouring communities into the new city of Greater Sudbury. Board members were paid $400 per day. After his appointment, Lamoureux acknowledged that he was not entirely comfortable with an appointed board imposing terms on elected officials. He supported the board's decision to merge Sudbury Hydro, Capreol Hydro and Nickel Centre Hydro into Greater Sudbury Utilities, and said the board made the right decision in not selling the utilities to Ontario Hydro One. Lamoureux resigned from the transition board in October 2000 to run for the Greater Sudbury Municipal Council in the 2000 municipal election. He defended the work of the transition board, and called for tax cuts through the amalgamation process. He was defeated, finishing fifth in a two-member ward. He later applied to council for a position on Greater Sudbury Utilities, but was not hired. He ran again in the 2003 municipal election, calling for a five-year roads program. He finished sixth in the city's fourth ward. In May 2003, Lamoureux purchased a former nursing home in Sudbury called Garson Manor. He reopened the building the following year as alternative housing for seniors."

A descendant of Captain Théophile de la Cour DesBrisay (1671–1761) whose Huguenot family fled religious persecution in France and settled in Dublin, Ireland before emigrating to Canada, Mather Byles DesBrisay was the great-great-grandson of Thomas DesBrisay, a Lieutenant-Governor of St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island). He was born in Chester, Nova Scotia and was educated in Halifax and Dartmouth. Trained in law, in 1851 Mather DesBrisay was admitted to the Bar of Nova Scotia. He eventually set up a law practice in his native Chester but in 1865 made Bridgewater his home. In 1867, DesBrisay entered provincial politics as part of the anti Confederation movement and in the Nova Scotia general election was voted to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. Reelected in 1874, the following year he was named Speaker of the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia. After 1875 DesBrisay was out of politics and in 1876 he married Ada Adams Harley. Mather DesBrisay served as a County Court judge for Lunenburg, Shelburne and Queens counties until 1897. An avid historian, in 1870 he published his book titled \"History of the County of Lunenburg.\" It marked what became a major pursuit of documentation that saw a revised edition of his book published in 1895. Following his death in 1900, the town of Bridgewater acquired his vast collection of papers and artifacts and established the DesBrisay Museum as a public community history museum. Mather and Ada DesBrisay are buried together in the Brookside Cemetery in Bridgewater."

During his term in office, the municipal council embarked on the town's first major public works projects, awarding contracts to M.N. McCarthy and W.H. Plummer for the construction of sewage, waterworks and electrical systems. However, the projects faced numerous delays, including a strike for higher wages by workers on the waterworks project, a cost overrun which forced the council to hold a referendum for authorization to spend the additional funds, and scheduling problems which resulted in the projects' completion being delayed by almost a year after the council voided the penalty clause which was its only mechanism for ensuring that the contractors finished the project on time. As a result, in that fall's municipal election, Biggar was defeated by former mayor Stephen Fournier. Following his defeat, Biggar disappeared from Sudbury in 1896, abandoning his law practice and his family. He was rumoured to have drowned in Lake Ramsey, but Sudbury resident Gus Harwood found him living in San Francisco in 1898. He had gone briefly to Yukon to prospect in the Klondike Gold Rush, but then moved to San Francisco after failing to stake a mining claim."

Educated in Montreal at Sir George Williams University and Collège Sainte-Marie de Montréal, he was a telephone technician. In 1962, he married Claudia June Burns. After serving two years on Halifax County Council, MacKay entered provincial politics in the 1978 election, defeating Liberal incumbent George Doucet in the new Sackville riding. He was re-elected in the 1981 election. In the 1984 election, MacKay was defeated by New Democrat John Holm, finishing third behind Liberal Bill MacDonald. Controversy arose during the campaign, when MacKay admitted he used a false address to claim expenses as a member living away from the capital. In April 1985, an Auditor General's report asked MacKay to repay over $7,000 in extra expenses. The money was paid back and MacKay was not charged criminally. In February 2004, a political comeback bid ended when MacKay's candidacy for the Conservative nomination in Halifax West for the 2004 federal election was rejected by the party. MacKay attempted to return to provincial politics in the 2006 election, running for the Nova Scotia Liberal Party in Hants East, but finished third."

  "text" : "Michael E. Haynes (born May 9, 1927) is an American minister and former politician in the state of Massachusetts. He was educated at Shelton State Community College and earned his bachelor's degree from New England School of Theology in 1949. He served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1965 to 1968, representing Roxbury, Massachusetts. He has also been a member of the Boston Mayor's Committee on Violence and the Attorney General's Advisory Committee on Drug Addiction. He was pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury from 1964 to 2004. During the 1960s and 1970s Haynes played an active role in the civil rights movement. In 1965, he helped plan Martin Luther King Jr.'s entrance into Boston when he came to speak on Boston Common that spring. The major focus of King's speech on April 23 was school desegregation in Boston. The Haynes Early Education school located in Roxbury was aptly named in his honor. On 9 November 2006, Northeastern University President Joseph E. Aoun met with members of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Massachusetts at the People's Baptist Church (830 Tremont Street, Boston) to discuss possible collaborations between Northeastern and Lower Roxbury clergy. During the meeting, Reverend Michael E. Haynes suggested the University create a history of the African American community in Lower Roxbury. As a result, President Aoun appointed Joseph D. Warren, at that time Special Assistant to the Director of Government Relations and Community Affairs, to oversee the Lower Roxbury Black History Project. Warren appointed an advisory board consisting of Rev. Michael E. Haynes, formerly of Roxbury's Twelfth Baptist Church, Massachusetts State Representative Byron Rushing, Northeastern University Archivist Joan D. Krizack, and Northeastern University history professors."

He was one of close to forty former British Empire officials to oppose the Malayan Union. Swettenham co-authored a \"A Dictionary of the Malay Language\" with Hugh Clifford. The dictionary, which was published in stages between 1894 and 1902, was abandoned after the letter 'G' as by then it had been made redundant by the publiciation of R.J. Wilkinson's \"A Malay English Dictionary\". He also published four books \"Malay Sketches\", \"Unaddressed Letters\", \"Also & Perhaps\" and \"Arabella in Africa\", the latter being illustrated by the famous mural painter and illustrator, Rex Whistler.

She is the sister of former Member of Parliament John Nunziata. An accounting clerk, she became head of the Harwood Ratepayers Association. She was first elected to office in 1985 as school board trustee for the City of York School Board. In 1988 she was elected to the York city council ousting incumbent Gary Bloor. On city council she rose to prominence as a whistleblower in the Fairbank Park affair. A deal had been made to sell part of the city park to a developer to build condominiums. Nunziata leaked material to the press illustrating irregularities in the process, leading to a police investigation of several local politicians. The affair pitted Nunziata against almost the entire York city council in a bitter debate. Nunziata took fellow councillor Nicolo Fortunato to court after he reportedly called her a \"slut\" and threatened to kill her. In the 1991 elections Nunziata was vindicated as six of the eight sitting councillors lost their reelection bids while Nunziata defeated her nearest rival by a ten to one margin. Eventually two York city councillors, one Metro Toronto councillor, and the developer were jailed over the affair. In the 1994 election Nunziata chose to challenge York mayor Fergy Brown. Nunziata was considered unlikely to defeat the incumbent, but after a spirited and often bitter campaign she emerged victorious. As mayor she ran into her own ethics issues when it was alleged she had used city money to pay a political operative. As mayor her main cause was an unsuccessful campaign to construct a subway line under Eglinton avenue. With the creation of the megacity in 1997 she was elected to Toronto city council. On city council she mostly concerned herself with law and order issues. She also was a prominent defender of Kimberley Glasco in her battle with the National Ballet of Canada. In 2010, George Berger, an executive assistant who worked for her in 2005 brought her before a human rights tribunal claiming harassment and discrimination during his employment. Berger claims that he was targeted due to a disability. Nunziata denies the claim. Berger is asking for monetary compensation and an apology. On December 7, 2010 she was nominated by Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday and elected as Speaker of Toronto City Council."

  "text" : "Frank Arthur Cooper (16 July 1872 – 30 November 1949) was Premier of Queensland from 1942 to 1946 for the Australian Labor Party. He was born on 16 July 1872 at Blayney, New South Wales, the son of an English miller and his Irish wife who had immigrated to Australia. Frank was educated in Sydney and worked as a clerk in various capacities around Sydney, including the Sydney diocese of the Anglican church and the Westinghouse brake company. In the latter capacity he moved to postings around the country before settling in Ipswich, Queensland where the main railway workshops for the State of Queensland were located. Cooper joined the Brisbane Clerical Union and became involved in Labor politics in Ipswich, including as president and secretary of the Ipswich Workers' Political Union, and was involved in the eight-hour day movement in provincial Queensland. His political activities, particularly his support for workers strikes in the state in 1912, caused him to run afoul of employer and he was dismissed, and Cooper subsequently became a journalist and activist within the Labor movement. He became editor of the Queensland Leader, a workers publication in Ipswich, in 1915 and remained so until 1925. In 1915 he was tapped to run for the seat of Bremer in the Queensland Parliament, a seat based in Ipswich which he would hold for the next three decades. In 1924 he became an alderman and eventually deputy-mayor for Ipswich City Council. In 1925 he married Agnes Hardy. Cooper had joined the first majority ALP government in Queensland under T. J. Ryan shortly after his election and became a prominent and well regarded member of the administration. Labor went back to opposition in 1929 but Cooper soon distinguished himself as an effective debater and parliamentarian. His reputation was such that he became Assistant Treasurer and Secretary for Public Instruction upon the election of William Forgan Smith as premier of a new ALP government in 1932. By 1938 Cooper was sitting on the Queensland ALP's central executive and was treasurer. He excelled in the position: that year he delivered the state's first budget surplus since 1927. He became deputy leader of the parliamentary party in September 1940, and played a key role in preparing Queensland's resources and mobilization for the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific. In 1942, the Federal ALP government under John Curtin introduced uniform taxation which ended the system of dual income taxes levied by both the states and the Commonwealth, instead making the Commonwealth the sole collector of income taxes with grants to be given back to the states to compensate for any losses. Many states, including Queensland, challenged the law in the High Court but were ultimately unsuccessful. Although William Forgan Smith accepted the decision he resigned soon after, and Cooper was duly elected to replace him as Premier of Queensland. Although now in his 70s, Cooper was an ardent supporter of the Commonwealth's prosecution of the war effort and worked with Curtin closely, sometimes invoking the ire of his own party in Queensland. Cooper continued in the premier role throughout the war, however at the war's end he stood down in favour of his Treasurer Ned Hanlon. In retirement he was active in the Anglican synod and on the senate of the University of Queensland, and died at his home in 1949. Cooper was accorded a State funeral which took place from St John's Cathedral to the Mount Thompson crematorium."

Chester finished third on the first count, and was declared elected on the eighth and final count. He served as a backbench supporter of Douglas Campbell's government during his time in the legislature. He did not seek re-election in the 1953 provincial election, but instead ran as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada for Winnipeg North in the 1953 federal election.

Bedford was born in Sydney and moved to Melbourne and then Adelaide after the death of her mother. She became involved in politics and became an electorate officer for former Labor MP Peter Duncan. She was elected to State Parliament in the 1997 state election. Hailing from the Socialist Left faction of the Australian Labor Party, Bedford has described herself as being South Australia's most left-wing MP. Her support for the Relationships Bill 2005, a bill which extends legal protections to same-sex couples, has made her a target of fundamentalist groups. Her opinions are considered by some as being incompatible with the opinions of her 'bible belt' electorate. Despite this, she was returned at the 2006 state election with a swing of more than 10 points (two-party-preferred), exceeding the statewide swing to the Labor government and defeating her Liberal opponent Pat Trainor, a former pastor in the Assemblies of God. As of the 2014 state election, Bedford holds Florey with a margin of 2.5 points."

He was chairman of the Gaddesden School Board.

His appointment as minister was confirmed in July 2003 by the Obasanjo administration.

Prior to his appointment as minister of culture and tourism, he served as Nigeria's ambassador to Greece and was also a one time mayor (1994–1996) in his local government council, Ikwo. His appointment as chairman (mayor) of Ikwo Local Government shot him into the political lime light and he has continued to be a proponent of youth development in his state. Frank Ogbuewu who until August 2010 was a member of the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) sought his former party's gubernatorial ticket in 2007 against the current governor of Ebonyi State, Chief Martin Elechi but lost. He later vied for the PDP national chairmanship position but was not successful. On August 28, 2010 during the traditional marriage of his oldest daughter, Nnenna Ogbuewu, the Ambassador announced his intention to vie once again, for the office of Governor in his home state of Ebonyi but this time, under a different party. His party of choice, the All Progressives Grand Alliance was made known in September, 2010. On January 12, 2011, Ambassador Ogbuewu was nominated by the All Progressives Grand Alliance with a total vote of 1852 to represent the party in the forthcoming general elections that will be held in Nigeria on April 16, 2011."

He was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1937 as the Labor member for Dandenong. In September 1943 he was briefly Minister of Public Instruction; after serving in the Royal Australian Air Force (1942–45) he resumed the office in November 1945, when he was also appointed Deputy Premier. He lost his seat at the 1947 election."

  "text" : "Frank Hirao Ogawa (May 17, 1917 – July 13, 1994) was a civil rights leader and the first Japanese American to serve on the Oakland City Council in which he served from 1966 until his death in 1994. Upon his death, the Oakland City Council voted unanimously to rename City Hall Plaza in his honor as the Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. The plaza displays a bronze bust of Ogawa. A Nisei, Ogawa was born in Lodi, California and never lived in Japan. Nevertheless, as Japanese Americans, the U.S. government involuntarily relocated Ogawa's family members to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Millard County, Utah and they were detained there for the duration of World War II. Ogawa married Grace Ogawa (née Hiruma) prior to their wartime detention and they had two children—Alan and Nancy. Nancy was born in the Topaz War Relocation Center but died at age 2. After the war, Ogawa returned to Oakland where he found work as a gardener. Eventually, he borrowed and saved enough money to open his own nursery. When Ogawa died, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, in her Tribute to Frank H. Ogawa, said: \"Frank Ogawa was a remarkable person because he could take personal misfortune and turn it into a positive learning experience for himself and others. When Frank and Grace Ogawa were forced to sell their belongings and live in internment camps during World War II, they had to sleep on straw mattresses in horse stalls for six months before beingshipped to a camp in Utah to spend another 3 1/2 years in confinement. Despite this mistreatment and injustice, he never lost faith in the United States. Just the opposite--he strived to prove his loyalty to his country and became an internationally recognized champion of Asian-Americans in the process.\" She went on to say \"Having served five years on the Oakland Parks Commission, Frank Ogawa was elected to the city council in 1966, making him the first Japanese-American to hold a council seat in a major city in the continental United States. He held that position for 28 years until his passing -- the longest tenure in Oakland's history.\" Ogawa was a member of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) from 1972 to 1988, having been appointed to the Commission by the Association of Bay Area Governments. Ogawa served on the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Board of Directors from 1979 until 1992 when he had to retire from the Board because of health issues. He served as Chairman of the Board during most of 1987 and served as Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board's Executive Committee and Personnel Committee. Ogawa was a Republican. However, he never held nor was he ever a candidate for any partisan office. As a public official, Ogawa was known as kind, optimistic, and adept at building consensus. In about December 1988, Ogawa underwent successful heart surgery. Ogawa died in Oakland on July 13, 1994, of lung cancer. He was survived by his wife Grace, son Alan, and by two grandchildren, Courtney and Matthew. More than 600 people, including a representative of Oakland's sister city of Fukuoka, Japan, attended Ogawa's memorial service."

His father, Dr. William Fee moved to Melbourne in 1884, and Frank Fee moved to Melbourne from Franklin, in 1887. He opened a hardware store and mortuary named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Charles H. Stewart, who had also served as mayor. Fee was in the hardware business in Pennsylvania. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. He served as city alderman in Fort Pierce from 1904 to 1905, and as mayor from 1905 to 1907. Fee apparently had advanced views for his times. He opposed the death penalty and he supported compulsory education."

In 1983 in a dispute about the use of volunteers in the ambulance service, as minister for Health, he publicly sided with the St. John Council who managed the ambulance service and two unions, the Ambulance Employees Association and the Miscellaneous Workers Association. John Cornwall, reflects that this position probably damaged his credibility at the time, with both unions and the Labor Party. Blevins was Treasurer of South Australia from 1992 to 1993.

  "text" : "Geraldine \"Gerri\" Whittington (September 11, 1931 – January 24, 1993) was the personal executive secretary to President Lyndon B. Johnson, and was the first African-American secretary in the White House. Johnson was famous for working long hours and insisting his assistants worked long hours as well. When John F. Kennedy was assassinated and Johnson became president, he requested a new slate of secretaries. He saw Whittington working in a government office, and requested that his \"special assistant\" Jack Valenti get her home phone number. Johnson called her unannounced one evening, and requested that she come in that night for an interview. According to audiotapes of Johnson's phone calls, Whittington at first thought the call was a joke, but came to believe that it really was the president on the line. She applied for the job and was offered the position. Having a black woman in the White House was very unusual in the early 1960s. Johnson wanted to advertise the fact that he'd hired a black woman, but chose not to call a news conference. Instead, he arranged for Whittington to appear on the television game show \"What's My Line?\", wherein contestants attempted to guess her profession. This may have seemed less overt, but probably exposed her to more viewers than if a standard press conference had been held. Whittington appeared on episode #696 of the game show What's My Line? on January 19, 1964. She was the first contestant. The mystery guest that evening was Van Heflin and the panel consisted of Arlene Francis, Steve Allen, Dorothy Kilgallen and Bennett Cerf. After Whittington signed the blackboard as \"Jerri Whittington,\" she told host John Daly that she was from West River, Maryland. Whittington's occupation was shown on the screen as \"Secretary to President Johnson.\" After her game, she described President Lyndon Johnson with the following words, \"great warmth, fair, kind, a perfectionist.\" Later Whittington appeared in several magazines, including Jet and Sepia. She was the first person to learn that Justice Thurgood Marshall had been nominated by President Johnson to the Supreme Court. Minutes before LBJ made the official announcement, he took his nominee down to her office and said, \"Here's the next Supreme Court Justice!\" She told friends that she thanked the President for making the choice of the first Black court justice. After suffering a stroke at age 38, Ms. Whittington died of cancer in Washington, DC, on January 24, 1993, on the same day as Justice Thurgood Marshall."

She became mayor on October 18, 1966  when she was selected by city council following the death of the city's previous mayor, Max Silverman. However, in the municipal elections the following year, Hartman was defeated when the city's popular longtime mayor Joe Fabbro, Silverman's predecessor, stood for election again. Hartman had previously campaigned for mayor in 1956, losing to Fabbro. In addition to the distinction of being the first woman to serve as mayor in the City of Sudbury, Hartman also shares the distinction with Dr. Faustina Kelly Cook of being one of the first women to serve on Sudbury City Council. They were both elected to Sudbury City Council on December 4, 1950. She served on council until 1954, when she was elected the city's comptroller. Hartman was also a president of the Ontario Municipal Association, a board member of the Royal Ontario Museum, and a chair of several social service and community organizations in Sudbury. She was born in Markdale, Ontario, and moved to Sudbury after marrying George Hartman in 1938. George Hartman died in 1960; Grace subsequently married Arthur Grout in 1969. In 1975, Hartman was named one of the 25 leading women of Ontario. In the late 1970s, Hartman and Grout retired to Toronto, although Hartman returned to Sudbury several times, to accept an honorary doctorate from Laurentian University and a lifetime achievement award from the city's business and professional women's association. Hartman died at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto on May 23, 1998. In 2001, the outdoor amphitheatre at the city's Bell Park, the site of the annual Northern Lights Festival Boréal, was named the Grace Hartman Amphitheatre in her memory. Creating the amphitheatre had been one of Hartman's key projects during her city council term."

A teacher by profession he ran for mayor of the township in 1978 but lost to David Bartlett. Brooks remained a councillor and defeated Bartlett in a 1985 rematch. In 1991 Brooks was defeated by local businessman James Stewart, whom Brooks had defeated in his 1988 reelection. Brooks was nominated as the Reform Party candidate for the riding of Nepean—Carleton, but in March 1997 he resigned due to conflicts with the riding association before the election. Later that year he defeated Stewart to regain the mayoralty. Brooks was a strong opponent of the amalgamation of Rideau Township into the city of Ottawa, but once the new city was created he chose to run for the role of Rideau's representative to the city. The race again pitted Brooks against Stewart. Brooks won by a substantial margin and was reelected by approximately the same margin in the 2003 Ottawa election against Paul Paton. In the 2006 election Brooks was challenged by Scott Moffatt, but was reelected. In the 2010 election Moffat again challenged Brooks, and this time won by a substantial margin."

Altobello first entered politics in 1985 when he was elected to the council of Scarborough to represent Ward 2, defeating more left-leaning candidate Barry Boyle. At 27, he was the youngest member on the council. He was re-elected with ease in 1988, but in 1991 he faced a fierce election battle against businessman Danny Lovatsis. Nevertheless, he was re-elected. He opposed the amalgamation of Scarborough, Toronto, and four other municipalities in 1997, but after it occurred he ran for a seat on Toronto city council in Ward 13. The ward structure at the time was such that the two candidates who received the most votes were elected in each riding. He was elected along with Brian Ashton. Fellow Scarborough city councillor Fred Johnson came in third. He has chaired the Planning and Transportation Committee. A centrist, he was aligned with the Liberal Party. On June 9, 2006, he was appointed a justice of the peace by the Attorney General of Ontario Michael Bryant, effective June 21, 2006. On June 14, 2006, he resigned as a councillor."

Though he mainly went by the name of 'Gabriel Milan', he identified himself as Don Franco de Tebary Cordova in his correspondence with King Frederick III of Denmark. Like many of the early Danish West Indies governors, Milan's term was short and stormful, as he disagreed with the Danish management on several issues. He was called to Denmark after less than two years and executed after a lengthy trial."

Pillitteri is a member of the Liberal party who first bid for the Niagara Falls electoral district in 1988. He lost to Conservative candidate Rob Nicholson in that election by a narrow margin of only 1,940 votes. After a second attempt in the 1993 general election, he defeated Nicholson by 10,823 votes and joined the federal Parliament and was re-elected in 1997 and 2000. He therefore served in the 35th, 36th and 37th Canadian Parliaments. Pillitteri is currently the longest serving consecutive Member of Parliament the Niagara Falls riding has ever had. Pillitteri left federal politics in 2004 and did not seek a fourth term in federal office. Rob Nicholson decided to put his name forward to run as the Conservative candidate in the next election only once he learned that Pillitteri had retired. Nicholson regained the riding that year."

  "text" : "Glenn Joseph Hagel (born August 17, 1949) is a Canadian provincial and municipal politician. He was a Saskatchewan New Democratic Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from 1986 to 2007, representing the constituencies of Moose Jaw North or Moose Jaw Palliser at different times during his career. He also served as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from 1996 to 1999. He was born in Drumheller, Alberta and was educated at the University of Manitoba and the University of Regina. Before entering politics, Hagel worked as a counsellor, educator and coordinator for a number of organizations. He married Karen Gifco and they have two daughters, Kristin and Meredith, and two granddaughters, Juliet and Nora. Hagel served in the Saskatchewan cabinet as Minister of Post-Secondary Education and Skills Training, from 1999 to 2001, as Minister of Social Services from 2001 to 2003, as Minister of Gaming from 2002 to 2003 and from 2006 to 2007, as Minister of Community Resources and Employment in 2003, as Provincial Secretary from 2006 to 2007 and as Minister of Culture, Youth and Recreation from 2006 to 2007. Provincially, Hagel's career apparently ended after being defeated by the Saskatchewan Party's Warren Michelson. Hagel is widely seen as losing his seat in the legislature due to a cover-up in the NDP caucus. He was elected mayor of Moose Jaw in the Saskatchewan municipal elections, 2009, and retired in 2012, deciding not to run for another term."

Her father was a businessman and a loyalist to the Democratic Party. He died when she was young, and Tully and her two sisters and brother were raised by their mother. She received her secretarial education at the Grace Institute in New York, and after graduating was appointed as secretary to Patrick Hayes, bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. In 1928, Grace Tully started to work for the Democratic National Committee, and was assigned to assist Eleanor Roosevelt, who was organizing support for presidential nominee Al Smith. Later that year, when FDR was nominated for Governor of New York, Grace Tully went to work on his staff. After Roosevelt's successful election, Tully began serving as the assistant to Missy LeHand, who was Roosevelt's personal secretary in Roosevelt's office at Albany, New York. Tully was given the dictation and typing duties that Lehand disliked. Tully served with FDR for his four years as governor. Grace Tully moved to Washington, D.C., in 1933, when Roosevelt was elected President. Both she and Missy LeHand were important figures for FDR during his presidency. Tully frequently accompanied FDR on his trips to Hyde Park and Shangri-La (today called Camp David). When Missy LeHand suffered a stroke in 1941, Grace Tully took over her position as personal secretary to the President. Tully was not an intimate or romantic companion for Roosevelt in the same way as LeHand had been. She continued working for the President until his death in April 1945 at his \"Little White House\" in Warm Springs, where she was present as he died. Then she served as the Executive Secretary for the FDR Foundation. In 1949 she published her memoirs, FDR: My Boss. In 1955 she joined the staff of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, working with Lyndon B. Johnson, the Senate Majority Leader at the time. She retired ten years later and died in 1984."

However, he was an alcoholic and womaniser. During these bouts, he provided secret information about their activities to the British. Hence, he was dismissed from the village by Raju. He took shelter in the house of his lover in 1923. During this time, the British arrested him and prosecuted him with the death sentence. On his appeal, the death sentence was changed in 1924 to life imprisonment at Andaman Jail. He was released in 1937 on the perusal of Congress politicians. In this way, he became the only associate of Raju to survive the British assault.

Fitzgerald was born in Cochrane, Ontario. A lawyer by profession, Fitzgerald was first elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the 1960 provincial election representing Halifax Northwest for the Progressive Conservative and was re-elected in 1963. In 1967 he was elected in the new riding of Halifax Cobequid. In 1969, he was appointed Speaker and served until the 1970 provincial election in which the Conservative government was defeated and Fitzgerald lost his seat. Following his defeat, Fitzgerald returned to his legal practice and was one of the province's top trial lawyers in the 1970s. In 1978, he was convicted for falsifying tax return forms, and was disbarred by the Nova Scotia Bar Association for fraud. In 1980, he was convicted of raping a female client in his office and sentenced to five years imprisonment. He was paroled in 1981 after serving ten months of his sentence and was pardoned in 1992. In 1982, Fitzgerald was awarded a five-month $15,000 contract by the Nova Scotia Liquor Commission to study proposed changes to the Liquor Control Act. The appointment was met with outrage by the Opposition in the House of Assembly and he resigned the appointment. Fitzgerald attempted a political comeback in the 1993 provincial election and contested the Progressive Conservative nomination in Dartmouth South to run against Liberal leader John Savage. He won the nomination by a margin of 29 votes to 25 votes for his opponent, Dartmouth city councillor Colin May but Conservative Premier Donald Cameron refused to sign Fitzgerald's nomination papers due to Fitzgerald's rape conviction. May was awarded the nomination instead. Fitzgerald died on May 1, 2014 at a hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia, aged 87."

He was born on 7 February 1853 at Beadnell, Northumberland, England and after training to become a blacksmith moved to Queensland in 1877. He became a mining speculator on the Croydon goldfields and then set up his own forge in Tambo, Queensland to service mining operations in the local region. He became involved in local politics for the Australian Labor Party, and in 1893 he was elected to represent the electoral district of Barcoo in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and served in that post until 1909. He rose to senior positions within the party, culminating in his election as leader of the Queensland Parliamentary Labor Party in 1904 after the death of his predecessor William Henry Brown. Kerr's leadership was complicated by a split in the party in 1905 in which he and other senior Labor figures opted to form a coalition with the Liberal Party to achieve statewide reforms. Although initially he commanded the confidence of the party, a state conference of the party in 1907 rejected Kerr's leadership and the Liberal-Labor coalition, opting to go into the 1907 state election alone. Kerr continued in parliament as an independent Labor member but was challenged by official Labor candidates until his defeat in his seat in 1909. He died on 18 January 1930 in Brisbane and was buried in Toowong Cemetery."

In February 1895, he formed a partnership in Eau Claire with John B. Fleming under the firm name of Fleming & Blum, with that arrangement continuing until January 1, 1908. In April 1901, Blum was elected Eau Claire County Judge and served in that capacity for 38 years. A special act of the Wisconsin State Legislature in 1927 greatly increased his powers and jurisdiction. Blum was heavily involved in the business community of the Chippewa Valley. In 1919, Judge Blum bought the Laycock and Drummond blocks of Eau Claire, Wisconsin for over $80,000 dollars. This was one of the largest real estate transfer deals in the history of the city. Blum was one of the founders of the Walter Brewing Company and Consumers Tire & Tube Company. Blum also served as director of the Union National Bank and of the Union Mortgage Loan Company until January 1, 1934. Judge Blum married Margaret D. McGillis and had two daughters and one son; Margaret, Genevieve, and George L., Jr. Blum died of heart disease in 1939."

Little studied law there with Charles Young and was admitted to the bar in 1844. He came to Newfoundland in 1846 and articled in law. He got involved in politics only a few years after. He helped lead the charge for responsible government along with John Kent. After it was granted in 1854, he went on to run a successful campaign as leader of the predominantly Roman Catholic Liberal Party. He became Newfoundland's first Premier in 1855 and served concurrently as the colony's Attorney-General. Little only remained in office until July 15, 1858, when he resigned to be succeeded by John Kent. In that time, he managed to secure Newfoundland's autonomy, in making sure Newfoundland had a say over its own destiny. Then Britain and France came with a plan involving the west coast of Newfoundland. Little objected and in a dispatch in 1857, the British cancelled the deal which would have been unfavourable to Newfoundland. He resigned in 1858 saying \"I go now before the milk of Human kindness goes sour for me\". He was right in that Newfoundland was about to enter an era of sectarian strife. Little was appointed as appointed assistant justice on the Supreme Court of Newfoundland in September 1858 and became Chief Justice two months later. In 1861, riots broke out over disputed election results from Harbour Grace. Little, as Chief Justice, played a prominent role in dispersing and calming the crowds. He married into a wealthy Anglo-Irish family in 1864 and retired to Ireland in 1868 and did a great deal for the home rule movement there. He died at the age of 73 in 1897 while living in Monkstown, Ireland. He married Mary Jane Holdright in 1864 and they had 13 children. Their youngest child Patrick Little was a senior Irish politician."

He was considered by some to have been \"the most respected politician in Ottawa\". Hume grew up in the Canterbury area of Alta Vista Ward. He attended Hawthorne Public School and Canterbury High School before graduating with a degree in Economics from Carleton University. He would then work as an assistant to Canterbury Ward councillor Michael McSweeney and then Alta Vista Ward councillor Darrel Kent. Hume was first elected as a city and regional councillor in 1991. In 1994 he was elected to the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton council (when it became an independently elected position). He was re-elected in 1997. In the 2000 Ottawa election, he chose to run against Ottawa city councillor Allan Higdon for city council, as the City of Ottawa and the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton were set to amalgamate the following year. He was able to defeat Higdon, and was acclaimed three years later in the 2003 Ottawa election. In 2002, Hume contributed $362.26 to the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party leadership campaign of Jim Flaherty. Hume is generally considered to be a \"red Tory\", who \"votes in favour of social spending, but talks convincingly about fiscal responsibility.\" In 2004, Hume allowed a private developer to hold a private party to raise money to pay off a debt Hume had received from running for President of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. Both Hume and the host of the party has refused to reveal the guest list to that event. Hume would later serve as President from 2008 to 2011. Hume was easily re-elected in the 2006 municipal elections with 70% of the vote and again in 2010 with 59% of the vote. Hume is currently the Chair of the City of Ottawa's Planning Committee, a position he has held since 2003. On August 22, 2014, Hume announced he would not be seeking re-election as councillor. In 2015, Hume partnered with former Minto vice-president, Jack Stirling, in a \"strategic partnership to pursue development projects and to advise both the private and public sector.\" Stirling, the old City of Nepean’s last planning commissioner before amalgamation, is well-known as another former local bureaucrat who jumped the fence in 2001 to work for Minto as vice-president of development, using his experience to stickhandle development proposals through the city’s Byzantine approvals process."

He supports the bridge to be built over the Rideau river (in his ward), and said this will create a connection to the Laurier Bike Lane to be built if the draft budget is approved. Earlier he indicated Ottawa has to become a city with 21st-century transportation. He also supported the green bin introduction, despite his reputation for fiscal conservatism."

In 2006, he was appointed as an interim councillor in ward 41, and was then elected as the councillor for Ward 43 in Scarborough East. On February 1, 2006, City Council appointed Ainslie to fill the vacancy in Ward 41 that was created when Bas Balkissoon was elected in a provincial by-election in the riding of Scarborough-Rouge River. A condition of the appointment was that he would not run as a candidate in the 2006 election. However, when councillor David Soknacki announced his intention not to run in Ward 43, Ainslie put his name forward as a candidate to replace him. Ainslie used to be an executive assistant to Soknacki. Soknacki supported Ainslie's candidacy. During the election campaign in 2006, a video surfaced which showed Ainslie promising to Toronto City Council not to run. \"I will not run in Ward 41, or any other ward in the city.\" His campaign literature urged voters to \"return\" him to city hall. He said that his campaign team suggested using the word \"re-elect\". Ainslie said, \"I didn't think it was proper.\" Despite the controversy, he elected in Ward 43. In April 2007, he determined that it costs $20,000 annually to provide councillors and staff at City Hall offices with free coffee every day. He moved a motion in committee to remove the expense, but it failed to pass. During the Rob Ford drug allegation scandal, Ainslie was removed as chair from the city's government management committee and appointed as chair of the parks and environment committee. On October 11, 2013 he resigned from the mayor's executive committee and his role as chair of the parks and environment committee over differences with Ford's longterm strategic direction for the city. On May 3, 2013, Ainslie was stopped by a RIDE check on Kingston Road and was given a three-day licence suspension."

Prior to entering provincial politics, he served as mayor of Dawson City from 1980 to 1994, earning the nickname \"Pirate Pete\" after he registered for satellite television service under the name of a dead local pioneer and then redistributed the television signals to residents of Dawson City for free. Jenkins was first elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly in the 1996 election in Klondike for the Yukon Party. He defended his seat in the 2000 election, the only Yukon Party member to do so. He assumed the leadership of the party after the election. He held the position as sole MLA and leader until May and June 2002, when Dennis Fentie crossed the floor from the NDP and won the leadership party's leadership, defeating Jenkins and former party president Darcy Tkachuk on the first ballot. He defended his seat successfully in the 2002 general election and was sworn into cabinet in November, serving as Health Minister and Deputy Premier until November 28, 2005 when he resigned from the party and cabinet. Jenkins said this was because \"the heart and soul of my community has been ripped out by the inefficiences of government at the municipal level, the territorial level.\" Fentie told the press at the time it was due to the ongoing loans file, which involved Jenkins owing $300,000 to the territorial government he was a part of. This eventually was cleared off the books in March 2006. Jenkins sat as an Independent MLA in the Assembly until dissolution, and chose not to run in the 2006 general election. Jenkins later ran for another term as mayor of Dawson City in the 2009 municipal election, defeating incumbent John Steins by seven votes. He was defeated in the 2012 municipal election by Wayne Potoroka."

A member of the Australian Labor Party, he was elected as the member for Gaven in the 2006 state election, defeating National Party member Alex Douglas, who had won the seat against Gray in a by-election earlier that year. In late 2008, Gray earned himself some bad publicity when he was accused of two separate instances of \"bullying\", both of them against elderly women. In the first instance he threaten to sue an outspoken constituent who, at a public meeting in November 2008, said she would not be voting for Gray. This was followed in December by a legal threat against a Labor member, from whom he demanded $10,000 and an apology, for criticising him in an internal party report. His behaviour was denounced by Premier Anna Bligh and Gray was forced to publicly apologise for his actions. The 2009 state election pitted Gray against Alex Douglas for the third consecutive time. On this occasion, Douglas, running under the banner of the newly formed Liberal National Party, narrowly emerged as the victor. Following his defeat, Gray angrily slammed what he perceived as negative and \"biased\" coverage of him by the Gold Coast Bulletin."

He represented the electoral district of Halifax Citadel in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1998 to 1999 as a member of the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party. Delefes is a life-long resident of the South End neighbourhood of Halifax, Nova Scotia. A graduate of Dalhousie University, Delefes is a retired school principal. He was an active member of the Nova Scotia Teachers Union, serving as president of the Halifax Local. He also served as President of the Heritage Trust of Nova Scotia. Delefes attempted to enter provincial politics in 1997, but lost to Liberal Ed Kinley by 165 votes in a byelection for the Halifax Citadel riding. He ran again in 1998, and appeared to defeat Kinley by 125 votes on election night, however, there was some confusion over the calculation of poll results and the margin of victory was reduced to 40 when official results were announced. A judicial recount was held on April 14, and Delefes was officially declared elected by 37 votes. In the 1999 election, Delefes and Kinley ran against each other for the third time in 19 months, but Progressive Conservative Jane Purves won the seat, defeating Delefes by 434 votes. Delefes tried to regain the seat in the 2003 election, but both he and Purves were defeated by Liberal leader Danny Graham."

Born in Lismore in Northern New South Wales to a prominent political family and educated at Lismore High School, Morton left school at fourteen to be employed in a legal firm, before branching out into various businesses. Moving to Sydney, Morton first entered politics in 1944 as an Alderman on Mosman Municipal Council, rising to be Mayor in 1946. Morton then entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 3 May 1947, representing the Electoral district of Mosman for the Liberal Party of Australia. Morton soon rose through the party ranks, becoming touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested the leadership in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton then stood, but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take the leadership. Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected to succeed him as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition. Morton contested as Leader the 1956 and 1959 elections, gaining seats each time but failing to defeat the long-standing Labor Government. A few months after the 1959 election, Morton was deposed as Leader by now-Deputy Leader Askin in July 1959. He remained on the backbenches until Askin led the Liberal Party to its first electoral victory in May 1965, whereupon Morton was appointed as the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Highways. He served in the cabinet, becoming prominent and controversial in his role in the reorganisation of the City of Sydney as Local Government Minister and state planning regulations, until he retired from parliament in June 1972. He died in Mosman aged 88 in 1999."

  "text" : "Peter Fenton (May 12, 1886 – October 5, 1953) was a Canadian politician, who served as mayor of Sudbury, Ontario from 1930 to 1932. He was the 17th mayor of Sudbury since its incorporation in 1893, and the first mayor of Sudbury after it was granted city status in 1930. On November 27, 1929 he was acclaimed mayor of the city due to the lack of candidates running for office in the 1929 election. In 1930 he stood again for mayor. During the election campaign he promised to build a new town hall and a subway under the Elm Street rail line, along with improving the local utilities in conjunction with municipal services. His campaign slogan was \"Sudbury is a progressive city; we should be optimists and boasters, not pessimists and knockers\". Fenton was widely regarded as a populist mayor and a worthy political opponent. On December 1, 1930, he won the election with 1,373 votes, the largest win in a municipal election in Sudbury at that time. He was successful at incorporating the city and building the Sudbury Jail, and did the best he could to enable the City of Sudbury to provide relief to citizens affected by the Great Depression. He converted the former jail into a flop house, and was able to provide relief to 4,142 recipients in December 1930. However, in an effort to encourage the recipients to \"find work\", meals were gradually cut back from three meals to one meal per day by March 1931. Despite his attempts at advocating for the impoverished citizens of Sudbury, his spending and confrontational style eventually thrust him out of office amid some controversy. Known for unilaterally making decisions on council and running a deficit, he was defeated in 1932 by W. Marr Brodie. Brodie was successful at demanding stricter practices in administering the city's welfare programs, the issue which cost Fenton the election. The ballots cast were 3,138 to 1,591, a clear margin of victory for Brodie."

In 1970, he was approached by a group of young radical socialists active at the University of New Brunswick and established a riding association in York—Sunbury with himself as president. The group soon became involved with the Ontario-based Waffle movement, a left wing socialist faction within the NDP and helped found the New Brunswick chapter of the Waffle in late 1970. The Waffle became a dominant force in the New Brunswick NDP in 1971 and Callaghan announced his intention to seek the party's leadership. Due to conflicts between Wafflers and anti-Wafflers over the legitimacy of the party's fall convention at which the New Brunswick Waffle manifesto had been approved, the party split into two, on October 16, 1971, with one faction led by Callaghan and a second, non-Waffle faction led by J. Albert Richardson with both men claiming to be NDP leader. The federal NDP intervened on November 12, 1971 by suspending the New Brunswick NDP and calling a special convention for November 21 to resolve the dispute. The Wafflers were demoralized by this and Callaghan spoke of leaving the NDP and reviving the CCF. Callaghan and many other Wafflers did not attend the special convention which saw the re-election of J. Albert Richardson as party leader. The Waffle declined and was inactive by the end of the year."

  "text" : "Peter Dawson (April 11, 1892 – March 24, 1963) was a Canadian minister, politician and member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Dawson was born in 1892 in Scotland. After attending schools and briefly working as a labourer and an apprentice to a butcher in Maybole, Dawson immigrated to Canada at the age of 18 with his brother, James Dawson. Shortly after arriving, he took up residence in Ontario where he worked in the automobile profession for 7 years until moving west to Alberta in 1918. Following his decision to settle in Calgary, he found employment as a butcher and interest in missionary work. His residence in Calgary, however, didn't last long, as 5 years later, he moved to the nearby capital city of Edmonton, where he attended Prebysterian schooling. Ordained as a minister of the United Church in 1927, he soon was called in 1928 to Sedgewick, where he remained for two years, before getting called to Champion. Although not intending to have a career in politics, a group of citizens persuaded him to run in the 1935 election, in which he defeated United Farmers Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Oran McPherson by 66% of the vote. In 1937, Dawson was appointed Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. During his 26-year tenure, from 1937 until his death in 1963, he witnessed and presided over many events, such as the first instance of crossing the floor in Alberta and naming a fellow MLA for remarks made at a provincial official. He also witnessed 2 royal visits to Alberta from two different monarchs, King George IV in 1939, and Queen Elizabeth II 20 years later, in which he presided over the installation of a fountain in the Legislature's rotunda. After dying in office in 1963, Dawson was honoured with a state funeral, attended by many prominent citizens of Alberta."

He was the author of several books of military history, including his controversial work The Donkeys (1961), which is considered to have inspired the musical satire Oh, What a Lovely War! Clark became known for his flamboyance, wit and irreverence. Norman Lamont called him \"the most politically incorrect, outspoken, iconoclastic and reckless politician of our times\". He is particularly remembered for his three-volume diary, a candid account of political life under Thatcher and a moving description of the weeks preceding his death, when he continued to write until he could no longer focus on the page. Clark was a passionate supporter of animal rights, joining activists in demonstrations at Dover against live export, and outside the House of Commons in support of Animal Liberation Front hunger-striker Barry Horne. When he died after radiation therapy for a brain tumour, his family said Clark wanted it to be stated that he had \"gone to join Tom and the other dogs.\""

In 2000, she became the party's leader again. In the 2005 provincial election, she received in excess of 25% of the vote in her home riding of Powell River-Sunshine Coast. She resigned her position in September 2006 when she was appointed by Federal Green Party Leader, Elizabeth May, to be one of her two Deputy Leaders of the Green Party of Canada. Earlier in 2006, Carr had co-chaired the successful campaign to get her political ally and long-time friend Elizabeth May elected as Leader. After two losses as a federal candidate in Vancouver Centre (2008 and 2011), Carr was elected to Vancouver City Council in November 2011. She was the sole candidate of the Green Party of Vancouver for one of 10 seats in the at large election held in November 2011 municipal election. This was her first electoral success in eight attempts, and she is the first person elected to major Canadian City's Council under the Green Party banner. She continues to support the Green Party of British Columbia and the Green Party of Canada. Carr was born in Vancouver and raised in the Lower Mainland and Kootenays. She earned a master's degree in Urban Geography from the University of British Columbia in 1980 and went on to a teaching career at Langara College."

  "text" : "Anne Johnston (born 1932) is a Canadian politician and executive. She was a longtime city councillor in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She was first elected to Toronto City Council in 1972, and served until 1985 when she ran against incumbent Mayor Art Eggleton, but was defeated. In 1988 she was elected to Metro Toronto Council (in the first election where Metro Councillors were directly elected). She served until Toronto was amalgamated into the megacity in 1997. That year, she was elected to the new Toronto City Council and served until 2003, when she was defeated by Karen Stintz. At the time of her defeat, she was the longest-serving and the oldest member of Toronto council. Johnston was also a candidate for Mayor of Toronto in 1978, when she lost to Fred Beavis in a deadlocked council vote for David Crombie's interim replacement; that vote literally came down to Beavis' name being drawn out of a hat. She campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1981 provincial election as a member of the Ontario Liberal Party, and lost to Progressive Conservative incumbent Larry Grossman in St. Andrew—St. Patrick by 3,835 votes. Johnston attempted to unseat Art Eggleton as mayor in the 1985 municipal election but was defeated 92,994 votes to 59,817. She returned to elected office in the 1988 when she was acclaimed as Metro Councillor for North Toronto. For most of her career, Johnston was known as a progressive voice on council. In her final term she supported a controversial condominium development at the corner of Yonge and Eglinton in 2002 adjacent to her ward. The North Toronto Tenants Network was so incensed by Johnston's move that they ran an advertisement in a local community paper, seeking applicants to contest Johnston's council seat. Stintz responded, and defeated Johnston in the 2003 municipal election by 2,321 votes. Johnston chaired the Toronto Seniors' Assembly and has been appointed as the group's Seniors' Advocate. The Anne Johnston Health Station in Toronto is named after her."

He was the 2008 recipient of Now Magazine's \"Best City Politician\" award. He graduated from McGill University with a bachelor's degree in archaeology, and has participated in excavations in Sudan, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, and Guatemala. He speaks English, French, and Arabic fluently. He is of Italian-American ancestry; his father moved to Canada to avoid the Vietnam War. As Chair of the Toronto Transit Commission, Giambrone oversaw the largest expansion of bus service in Toronto. Giambrone secured over $8 billion in new funding to build light rail into areas of the city currently not served by rapid transit. An expansion of two subway lines also forms part of an overall $18 billion long-term expansion plan driven by Giambrone. On February 1, 2010, Giambrone announced his candidacy to succeed David Miller as Mayor of Toronto in the 2010 election, as a leading progressive candidate, showing second place in polls after John Tory dropped out, though Giambrone also had a high \"unfavourable\" rating of 40%. Giambrone exited the mayoral race on February 10, 2010 amidst a sex scandal and he did not run for re-election for his council seat. Giambrone was the Ontario NDP's candidate for the August 1, 2013 provincial by-election in Scarborough—Guildwood. He placed third with 28% of the vote."

  "text" : "Alexander Turk (March 5, 1906 – January 1, 1988) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal-Progressive from 1953 to 1958. Born in Larne, Northern Ireland, the son of Nathaniel Turk and Mary O'Lynn, Turk came to Canada with his family in 1910, and was educated at Lord Selkirk School. In 1931, he married Annie Owens. He was a wrestling promoter and president of the Giants Baseball Club, and was known in politics as a charismatic showman. Some credit him with introducing modern professional wrestling to Manitoba in 1946 with his company, the NWA-affiliated Alex Turk Promotions. In later years, he would promote Verne Gagne, Pat O'Connor, Bruno Sammartino, Haystacks Calhoun, Lou Thesz and others in the region. He was eventually pushed out of business by competition from the American Wrestling Association. Turk's election to the Manitoba legislature was somewhat unexpected. In the 1953 election, he ran as a candidate of the Liberal-Progressive Party in Winnipeg North, a constituency dominated by the socialist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and the communist Labour Progressive Party. He finished seventh out of eleven candidates on the multi-member constituency's first count, behind two other Liberal-Progressive candidates. He did well on transfers, however, and defeated fellow Liberal-Progressive J.M. Kozoriz for the final position. In the legislature, he served as a backbench supporter of Douglas Campbell's government. Turk was on the left-wing of the Liberal-Progressive Party. In 1954, he was the only member of the government caucus to support a CCF bill calling for comprehensive health insurance. The following year, he was the only Liberal-Progressive MLA to endorse a bill calling for progressive prison reforms. Winnipeg's multi-member constituencies were eliminated in the 1958 election, and Turk lost to Steve Peters of the CCF by 856 votes in the newly created riding of Elmwood. He ran again in the 1959 election, but finished third. After leaving provincial politics, Turk was elected to the Winnipeg City Council. Though a member of the conservative Civic Election Committee, he again showed himself to be a progressive representative on issues relating to workers, pensioners and the handicapped, and often voted with the CCF group. In 1964, he lost his seat on council to another CEC candidate."

Haydon was the first mayor of the city of Nepean when it incorporated on November 24, 1978; Ben Franklin assumed the title one week later. Born in Toronto, Haydon came to Ottawa when he was six. He attended Queen's University where he received a degree in chemical engineering. He then worked in Cornwall, Ontario as a professional engineer. He moved to Nepean Township in 1961 and in 1966 he was elected to Township council, after it was expanded to five aldermen from three. In 1969, he was elected reeve of Nepean. He defeated the incumbent reeve D. Aubrey Moodie in a landslide with 66% of the vote, thanks to the new subdivisions in the city unhappy with Moodie's tax increase. The Nepean Sportsplex and National Capital Equestrian Park were built during Haydon's term as reeve. In 1978 he became the regional chair of Ottawa-Carleton, where he served for 13 years, helping to introduce Ottawa's Transitway, Ottawa City Hall (then the Regional Offices), and the Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre. He failed however in his plans to establish a second Greenbelt in the city as well as his dreams of establishing Ottawa as a federal capital district. After retiring from politics, he ran a bed and breakfast with his wife. Andrew Haydon Park on the Ottawa River and Andrew Haydon Hall, the city council chambers at Ottawa City Hall, were named after him. Carleton University offers a scholarship in his name each year to a student in an engineering program. In September 2006, Haydon unexpectedly announced his candidacy in the new suburban ward of Gloucester-South Nepean, 15 years after his retirement from politics. He was defeated by Steve Desroches in the 2006 municipal elections. In September 2010, Haydon announced his candidacy for Mayor of Ottawa. He joins 19 other candidates for mayor in the Ottawa municipal election. Haydon has four children with his deceased wife, Mary Leishman. He is currently married to Sherry Franklin, the widow of Ben Franklin, Haydon's successor as mayor of Nepean."

  "text" : "Aksel Larsen (August 5, 1897 – January 10, 1972) was a Danish politician who was chairman of the Communist Party of Denmark and chairman and founder of the Socialist People's Party. Larsen became leader of the Communist Party in 1932, and was elected to the Danish Parliament (Rigsdagen) in 1932. Together with other Danish communists, Larsen had to go into hiding in 1941 when the Danish police began arresting all party members. After the liberation of the Second World War Larsen became a minister in the interim government, and subsequently led his party to its best-ever result in the October 1945 election, in which it took 10% of the vote. The election however, resulted in a Liberal government, and Larsen's party was mostly shunned by the other party leaders. Following the rising in Hungary in 1956, Larsen condemned the Soviet Union's action. This led him into conflict with the members of the party leadership who had a greater loyalty to Moscow; a conflict that ended with his expulsion in November 1958. Larsen's reaction was to establish the Socialist People's Party (Socialistisk Folkeparti), which, thanks to Larsen's personal popularity, entered parliament at the 1960 election at the expense of the Communists, who from then on played only a very peripheral role in Danish politics. Aksel Larsen -- who was especially in later years highly respected among politicians, even if his party was seen as somewhat irresponsible -- remained as leader of the Socialists until 1968, when he handed over to Sigurd Ømann. He remained an MP until his death in 1972. In 2005, the Danish Institute for International Studies concluded that Larsen held a secret working relationship between 1958 and 1964 with one of Denmark's allied partners in the Cold War, stating that \"Larsen... obviously was an agent of a Western intelligence service.\""

Antoine Maurice Thompson (born March 1, 1970) was a Democratic New York State Senator who represented the state's 60th Senate district, which includes parts of Buffalo and Tonawanda, the City of Niagara Falls and the Town of Grand Island. Thompson previously served for six years as the Masten District councilman in the Buffalo Common Council. Thompson has been a lifelong Buffalonian and held political and politically related professional positions in Buffalo before his service in elective politics. Thompson was appointed to the city council in 2001 and was twice re-elected. He was discouraged from pursuing his interest in election to the United States House of Representatives in 2005. He was encouraged to pursue a New York Senate Seat, but was not nominated by the Democratic Party when the seat first became available in a special election. However, during the 2006 general election for the seat, he was victorious. Thompson was challenged in the 2008 primary by the current holder of the seat but was victorious and was unchallenged in the November election. In 2010 Thompson won a 3-way primary battle but lost to Mark Grisanti, a Democrat who ran as a Republican. After the election Grisanti became a Republican."

Pietz only served one term, during the 33rd Canadian Parliament, as he was defeated in the 1988 federal election at the reorganized Welland—St. Catharines—Thorold riding by Parent. He made a political comeback in 1991 when he was again elected as a Niagara Regional Councillor for Welland. Shortly afterward, he ran for the Chairmanship of the Niagara Regional Council, but was defeated by Brian Merritt. He did not seek re-election in 1994 and has since retired from political life."

Born in 1901, he was one of the leaders of Tamralipta Jatiya Sarkar (Tamrlipta National Government), which came into effect on 17 December 1942 during the Quit India Movement, a programme of civil disobedience launched in India in 1942. He was greatly influenced by Swami Vivekananda. Earlier a member of the Indian National Congress, he later became a leader in the Bangla Congress, which co-governed with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in two United Front governments in the 1960s and 1970s. He held the chief ministerial position in both these governments, from March to November 1967, and again from February 1969 to March 1970.In the year 1967 Ajoy Mukherjee defeated Prafulla Chandra Sen another Gandhian at Arambagh assembly constituency and became chief minister of West Bengal after Prafulla Chandra Sen. Architect of Ajoy Mukherjee's victory at Arambagh was Narayan Ch Ghosh the then students leader at arambagh. Narayan Ghosh accompanied Ajoy Mukherjee in a boat for several days to see sever flood effected areas in Arambagh & Ghatal subdivision during 1968. People of flood affected areas were enthused by Ajoy Mukherjee for his untired move to stand for them. Ajoy Mukherjee with some of his closed colleagues, viz. Pranob Mukherjee etc., joined Indian National Congress leaving Sushil Dhara- his long term associates. He was offered ministerial post at Centre by Indira Gandhi, but Ajoy Mukherjee saying his age and health condition had pushed Pranab Mukherjee. Pranab Mukherjee became State Minister in the Indian Cabinet. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan award in 1977 from Government of India. His brother Biswanath Mukherjee was the husband of Geeta Mukherjee, a communist MP. Ajoy's niece Kalyani (daughter of another brother) was married to Mohan Kumaramangalam and was the mother of Rangarajan Kumaramangalam and Lalitha Kumaramangalam.

For many years she was the personal secretary to Mrs. David Levy, whose father was one of the founders of Sears, Roebuck and Company. In 1941 she married Edmund S.

After Eisenhower was elected president, Mrs. Whitman accompanied him to Washington, D.C., and served as his personal secretary the entire eight years of his presidency. She helped manage Eisenhower’s correspondence and was responsible for maintaining Eisenhower’s personal files which he kept in his office at the White House. When President Eisenhower left office in January 1961, Mrs. Whitman accompanied him to his farm (now the Eisenhower National Historic Site) in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and continued to work for a few months as his personal secretary. She later joined the staff of New York Governor and later Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, for whom she worked until she retired in 1977.

  "text" : "Alvaro Farinacci (born September 11, 1944) is a Canadian politician. Elected as a municipal councillor for the first time back in 1983, Alvaro Farinacci quickly succeeded in gaining the confidence of the Mayor and Council, as reflected in his appointment to the Executive Committee the following year. Due to his vast experience as a certified real estate broker and member of the Board of Directors of the Montreal Real Estate Board for 17 years, he was entrusted with the responsibility of a number of matters relating to urban development. At the same time, Mr. Farinacci also held various other positions over those years, including chairman of the Commission de l'aménagement du territoire et du développement économique (land use planning and economic development committee), member of the Comité de toponymie (toponymy committee) and, for 16 years, was a member of LaSalle's Comité consultatif d'urbanisme (urban planning advisory committee), where he in fact served as that committee's first chairman. Mr. Farinacci also very significantly contributed to LaSalle's economic growth. He was a founding member of the Corporation de développement économique de LaSalle (CDEL) in 1984 and then served as CDEL's chairman for a number of years. He was also one of the founders of the Comité de sécurité industrielle (committee on safety in the workplace). Recalling that the Mayor had given him the mandate \"to develop a structure designed to arouse interest in order to promote and attract investments to LaSalle\", Alvaro Farinacci mentioned how very proud he was of his contribution to the birth of CDEL, \"which was one of the biggest successes in the history of LaSalle\".From 2001 to 2013, he was a Council member of the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal, which greatly benefited from his real estate experience and expertise, entrusting him with the position of vice-chairman of the Commission permanente du logement social (standing committee on social housing). At the present time, he is a member of Ville de Montréal's Commission sur le développement économique et urbain et l'habitation (committee on economic and urban development and housing).A certified real estate agent for 40 years, a businessman actively involved in his community, Alvaro Farinacci has also played a major role in LaSalle's community and cultural life, for instance, as a member of the Board of Directors of Centre culturel Henri-Lemieux and the Fondation de l'Hôpital LaSalle, where he was a Board member and vice-chairman for 25 years."

  "text" : "Joseph Alfred (Fred) Laberge (February 16, 1893 - March 27, 1964) was a Canadian politician, who served as mayor of Sudbury, Ontario in 1920 and 1921. Laberge was the son of Jean-Baptiste Laberge, who founded the Laberge Lumber Company and constructed many of the earliest buildings in Sudbury. He later took over management of the company from his father. Elected mayor in 1920, Laberge was at 27 years old the youngest mayor ever elected in Sudbury at that point. He was also the first mayor to have been born in Sudbury, and the first francophone to hold the mayoralty since Francis Lemieux in 1903. His election marked at least a temporary end to linguistic tensions between the city's anglophone and francophone communities initiated by the Conscription Crisis of 1917, and ironically occurred just one year after the first municipal election in the city's history in which francophone candidates had failed to win a single seat on council. Following his term as mayor, Laberge ran for the Conservative nomination in Nipissing in the 1925 federal election, but was subjected to a blackmail attempt by Elzéar Cousineau, who wrote him an anonymous letter demanding a $2,000 payout. Laberge turned the letter over to the police, and on their advice left a dummy package in Cousineau's requested location, and Cousineau was arrested when he arrived to retrieve the package. Despite Cousineau's arrest, however, Laberge withdrew from the nomination race in favour of John Ferguson. Ferguson failed on election day to defeat incumbent MP Edmond Lapierre; Laberge was selected as the party's candidate in the subsequent 1926 election, but also lost to Lapierre. After his retirement from the lumber business, Laberge moved to Montreal, Quebec, and died at his home in Westmount on March 27, 1964."

He is a member of the United Malays National Organisation in Malaysia's ruling Barisan Nasional coalition. Ahmad Razif, the son of a religious teacher, was raised in Terengganu. He graduated from Universiti Putra Malaysia with a Masters in Science and rose through the ranks of his local UMNO division. In 2008 he was elected to the Terengganu State Legislative Assembly for the seat of Seberang Takir, defeating a People's Justice Party (PKR) candidate. The State's incoming Chief Minister Ahmad Said appointed him to the State's Executive Council—akin to a cabinet—with responsibility for education, higher education, science, technology and human resources. Ahmad Razif retained his assembly seat at the 2013 election. However, the Barisan Nasional state government almost lost its majority in the assembly, clinging to power with a slim 17–15 majority. In response, the coalition's national leader, and the Prime Minister, Najib Razak, pressured Ahmad Said to resign within a year. In May 2014, Ahmad Said stood down and Ahmad Razif was appointed as his replacement. He was sworn in to office by Mizan Zainal Abidin, the Sultan of Terengganu, on 13 May. Ahmad Razif's first task as Chief Minister was to navigate a political crisis when Ahmad Said and two other UMNO assemblymen resigned from UMNO immediately after his appointment, potentially plunging his government into minority status. Ahmad Said stated that he was dissatisfied that he had not been allowed to remain as Chief Minister until after the wedding of his daughter in May 2014. The three assemblymen returned to the party within days, after the intervention of Najib and other senior Barisan Nasional leaders. On 22 April 2016, his 'Datuk Seri' title had been revoked by the Sultan."
