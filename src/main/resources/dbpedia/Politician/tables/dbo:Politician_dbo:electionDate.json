While the 18th district leans only slightly Democratic, having a Cook PVI D+4, Cardoza only faced serious competition in 2002, when he was first elected to the seat. This race is considered competitive in 2010 because of Mike's experience in local agriculture, his family name, and the current political climate. Berryhill comes from a Republican political family that's well known in the San Joaquin Valley. Mike’s Uncle, Clare Berryhill, served in both houses of the California State Legislature and also served as director of the California Department of Food and Agriculture under Governor George Deukmejian. His first cousins, Tom and Bill Berryhill, currently represent the 25th and 26th districts, respectively, in the California State Assembly. Mike was president of Young Farmers and Ranchers of California and elected to the Turlock Irrigation District Board. He also served several decades on the Ceres School Board, and, in 2005, Berryhill Elementary School was named in honor of Mike and other members of the Berryhill family who served on the school board."
