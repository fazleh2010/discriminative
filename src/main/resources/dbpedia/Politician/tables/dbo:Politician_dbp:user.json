  "text" : "Peter Hoyt Brown (born October 16, 1936) is a politician who held office as an at-large Council Member in the city of Houston, Texas. Known locally as \"Peter Brown,\" he was a candidate for the 2009 Houston Mayoral race, to succeed then Mayor Bill White who vacated the position due to term limits. Although an independent poll conducted by 11 News/ KUHF Houston Public Radio poll in late October 2009, showed Brown holding the lead in the Mayor's race with a nine point lead over his nearest opponent, he was eliminated in the November 3, 2009 election."
