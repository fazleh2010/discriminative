She was a founding member and the Green Party of British Columbia's first spokesperson (leader) from 1983 to 1985. In 1993 the Party formally established the position of \"Leader\". In 2000, she became the party's leader again. In the 2005 provincial election, she received in excess of 25% of the vote in her home riding of Powell River-Sunshine Coast. She resigned her position in September 2006 when she was appointed by Federal Green Party Leader, Elizabeth May, to be one of her two Deputy Leaders of the Green Party of Canada. Earlier in 2006, Carr had co-chaired the successful campaign to get her political ally and long-time friend Elizabeth May elected as Leader. After two losses as a federal candidate in Vancouver Centre (2008 and 2011), Carr was elected to Vancouver City Council in November 2011. She was the sole candidate of the Green Party of Vancouver for one of 10 seats in the at large election held in November 2011 municipal election. This was her first electoral success in eight attempts, and she is the first person elected to major Canadian City's Council under the Green Party banner. She continues to support the Green Party of British Columbia and the Green Party of Canada. Carr was born in Vancouver and raised in the Lower Mainland and Kootenays. She earned a master's degree in Urban Geography from the University of British Columbia in 1980 and went on to a teaching career at Langara College."

Canova went to St. Augustine to enlist in the Confederate Army in 1861. In 1885 he wrote Life and Adventures in South Florida, in which he lamented the demise of wildlife in the Indian River area."
