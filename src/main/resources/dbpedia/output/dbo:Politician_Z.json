Not until 1974, when she was 16 years old, she could only visit him. Mandela-Dlamini studied at Waterford Kamhlaba United World College of Southern Africa and science at Boston University. It was there that she first met Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini of Swaziland (an elder brother of the reigning monarch of Swaziland, Mswati III and of Queen Mantfombi of the Zulus), who was studying science at the same university. The two married in 1973 and had four children (Zaziwe (born 1977), Zamaswazi (1979), Zinhle (1980) and Zozuko (1992)) and four grandchildren, but are currently separated.They are co-owners of Mandela, Dlamini and Associates (International Business Consultants). She was appointed ambassador for South Africa to Argentina in July 2012 (taking office in October), becoming the first of Mandela's children to enter public service; she succeeded retiring diplomat and former opposition leader Tony Leon."
