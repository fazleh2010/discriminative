  "text" : "Ida Chong (Chinese: 張杏芳; pinyin: Zhāng Xìngfāng; born 1956 or 1957) was previously British Columbia's Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development and was Minister Responsible for the Asia-Pacific Initiative as well as Minister of Technology, Trade, and Economic Development; Minister of Community Services; and Minister Responsible for Women's and Senior's Services (June 2005 - June 2008); Minister of Advanced Education (December 2004 to June 2005); and Minister of State for Women's and Senior's Services (January - December 2004). She was appointed Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development in March 2011. Chong was the BC Liberal MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head. She was first elected in 1996 and was re-elected in 2001, 2005, and 2009. Born and raised in Victoria, British Columbia, Chong began her political career in 1993 as a municipal councillor for the District of Saanich. She ran her own accounting firm with business partner Karen Kesteloo and is a fellow of the Certified General Accountant of BC (FCGA). She was awarded a CGA-BC lifetime membership in September 2014. On September 18, 2014, Chong announced her intention to run for mayor of the City of Victoria in the November 2014 municipal election which she subsequently lost, coming a distant third to new mayor, Lisa Helps and previous mayor Dean Fortin. While Chong lost badly, it was widely speculated that she knew she could not win but instead wanted to ensure previous mayor Fortin, who ran a campaign primarily with backing of the New Democratic Party (NDP), would not win. Chong successfully set the ballot question based on Fortin's mishandling of the Johnson Street Bridge Replacement Project but simply did not have enough voters to make an impact. Fortin ultimately lost to Helps by a mere 89 votes. While Chong's running in a known left-wing municipal election after a long and successful career as a Provincial Cabinet Minister was baffling to many, the speculation is that Chong knew she could pull votes from the moderate Fortin, with a long-term strategy to strengthen the Green/Progressive vote in the region and province thus weakening the New Democratic Party by splitting the leftist vote."

For other people with similarly spelled names, see Ian McDonald (disambiguation).) Ian Michael Macdonald (born 7 March 1949), a former Australian politician, was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1988 to 2010 representing the Australian Labor Party. Between 2003 and 2010, Macdonald held a range of ministerial responsibilities in the Carr, Iemma, Rees, and Keneally ministries. Macdonald, who joined the Labor Party in 1972, had his membership of the party terminated in 2013 for bringing the party into disrepute. After the Independent Commission Against Corruption found that Macdonald acted in a corrupt manner, in November 2014 it was announced that following advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions, Macdonald will be prosecuted for the offence of misconduct in public office for corruptly issuing of lucrative mining licences at Doyles Creek in the Hunter Valley."

Having graduated from the London School of Economics and completed National Service in the Royal Air Force, he trained as a Church of England priest and was ordained in 1958. In order to stand for Parliament in 1974, he had to renounce his orders. At the February 1974 general election, Clemitson was elected as Member of Parliament for Luton East. He lived in the constituency and held his seat at the October 1974 election but, at the 1979 general election, lost by 847 votes to the Conservative Graham Bright. He moved to France with his wife (Janet) and daughter (Suzannah) in the late 1990s and died at his home there, aged 66, just before Christmas 1997. Following his death, his sister, Jean, persuaded the General Synod of the Church of England to permit a stained glass window to be installed in his memory at St Mary's Church in Harlington, Bedfordshire, the village where they had lived for some time during childhood. The window, designed by Petri Anderson, was dedicated in May 2009. Clemitson co-wrote \"A Life to Live: Beyond Full Employment\" (Junction Books, 1981) with George Rogers MP. Clemitson House, a municipal building in the centre of Luton, is named in memory of Clemitson and his father (Daniel), who had served as an alderman on the local council. Clemitson was a lifelong supporter of Luton Town Football Club."

He oversaw the bond issue to build Kansas City International Airport and pushed for construction of the Truman Sports Complex for the Kansas City Chiefs and eventually the Kansas City Royals. He dealt with labor strife during the construction of the two projects and the 1968 Kansas City riot following the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King. In April 1968 following the King assassination Davis met with a large group of inner city school students on the steps of City Hall.

  "text" : "Isiah \"Ike\" Leggett (born July 25, 1944) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Maryland, currently serving as the executive of Montgomery County, Maryland. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Born in Deweyville, Texas, Leggett attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and, after serving in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Army, earned a law degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1986, he became the first African-American elected to the county council in Montgomery County, Maryland and served on the council through 2002. He remains the only African-American ever elected to that body at-large. For two years, Leggett served as the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party before leaving that position to run for office once again. Leggett was elected County Executive of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office. Since taking office, Leggett has worked to put the County’s fiscal house in order while strengthening critical County services in education and public safety, and helping the most vulnerable. In the four years before Leggett took office, County spending grew by over 40 percent. In his first five years in office, Montgomery County's spending was held to zero percent. Responding to the worldwide recession that hit in 2008, Leggett closed budget gaps of over $2.6 billion, eliminating 10 percent of County government positions, while imposing furloughs (including himself), wage freezes, and changes in retirement and health benefits to save the County money. At the same time, Leggett put tens of millions of dollars into building and preserving thousands of units of affordable housing in the County, establishing a CountyStat office to ensure “real time” performance of County services, and set up a multi-agency Positive Youth Development Initiative to ensure positive programs for at-risk youth. Leggett worked to strengthen Montgomery County's biotechnology and life sciences sectors and also established the \"311\" Customer Service as a single point of entry via phone and the internet for residents seeking County services. During Leggett's first eight years, serious crime went down in the County by 24 percent and the Fire and Rescue Service's response times to Montgomery County's fires improved dramatically. Leggett was reelected to a second term in 2010 and to a third four-year term in 2014."

Thomas was born on 22 January 1895, the son of David William Thomas,a self-employed greengrocer of Cwmparc, Rhondda. He was educated at a local elementary school, and in 1908, at 13 years of age, he began working at the Dare colliery, Cwmdare, Aberdare. He attended evening classes in economics and history in order to improve his education, and in 1918 he joined the Labour Party. In 1922 he was promoted to the position of checkweighman at Cwm-parc. He was a prominent figure within the South Wales Miners' Federation and the National Union of Mineworkers for more than 30 years and held a number of offices in the Park and Dare Lodge, the largest in the south Wales coalfield. During the 1926 coalminers' strike Thomas was sentenced to three months imprisonment as the chairman of the Park and Dare Lodge as a result of his involvement in industrial disturbances. He was elected a member of the Rhondda Borough Council in 1928, chaired many of its committees and served as its chairman in 1938-39. He remained a member until 1951. He served, too, on a number of joint industrial councils for Wales and Monmouthshire, and was a member of the South Wales Electricity Board, 1947-49. In 1950 he was elected for Rhondda West and continued to represent the constituency until his death in 1966. He was much interested in economic and industrial matters. Thomas was a consistent opponent of Welsh nationalism and fought relentlessly against the Parliament for Wales agitation of the 1950s. He publicly attacked Plaid Cymru on several occasions and in October 1965 he was highly critical of the recommendations of the Hughes-Parry Report on the Legal Status of the Welsh Language. In 1960 he supported the Conservative government's measure to open public houses on Sundays. He married in October 1920 Annie Mary, daughter of D.J. Davies. She, too, was active in the Labour politics of the area. She died in July 1956. They had one son and one daughter. Thomas died on 3 December 1966 at his home 94 Park Road, Cwmparc, Rhondda."

  "text" : "Ian Leslie Stuart Blenheim Bradley (10 August 1937 – 20 June 2015) was a regional councillor in Auckland, New Zealand and a former Commander and Temporary Captain in the Royal New Zealand Navy. He was the father of television presenter Sarah Bradley. Born in Hampstead, London, England in 1937, Bradley joined the Royal New Zealand Navy at age 15 and rose through the officer ranks during a 27-year naval career, marked by much success but which ultimately ended in controversy. To the Navy he was a charismatic leader, known for his intellect. He was unquestionably dedicated to the Navy, but he was impatient with red tape; Bradley always said he wanted ‘a thinking Navy’. Bradley joined the RNZN as a Cadet Midshipman in 1953. As was standard for New Zealand officer cadets at the time, his initial training took place ashore in Australia (HMAS Cerberus) before he was sent to the UK for sea training aboard the aircraft carrier HMS Triumph. He returned to New Zealand in 1957; his postings included a year aboard HMNZS Endeavour (the little, wooden-hulled, Antarctic support ship). Ian applied his navigational skill to accurately chart several Antarctic islands. Bradley was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in 1959. As a recognition of his abilities he was posted to the UK to join the commissioning crew of HMNZS Otago, the first of New Zealand's modern, purpose-built frigates. He specialised in underwater warfare and diving, and returned to the UK for advanced training, where he topped his courses and was awarded the Ogilvy Medal by the Admiralty. These courses were followed by two years loan service with the Royal Navy, including a year at sea in one of the (then) latest anti-submarine frigates HMS Lowestoft. Bradley married and had two daughters but unfortunately the marriage ended in divorce. He remained devoted to his daughters and was proud of their careers. However, his lively charisma also continued to be attractive to many females. Back in New Zealand he was very proud to be appointed to the Royal Yacht BRITANNIA during the 1966 Royal Tour of New Zealand.During the late 1960s he served as director of plans for the RNZN and played a major role in developing the modifications the RNZN made to the design of the 4th frigate the HMNZS Canterbury, a broad beam Leander which was built for the RNZN with an enlarged flight deck to allow helicopters larger than the Wasp, a with the flight deck activity monitored from the Operations Room by cameras on the hangar roof and the associated replacement of the suppressed limbo well with std USN Mk 34 triple torpedo launchers for close in anti-submarine defence with shallow water Mk 44 torpedoes and deep water Mk 46 torpedoes. These modifications were later extended to most RN Leander modernisations. Many other modifications to the Leander design, planned by Ian Bradley, such as the fitting of American sonars and the provision of the 8 km AS-12 missile for the Wasp to engage fast attack craft and surfaced submarines were rejected on political and cost grounds. After continued sea service Bradley was given the important post of Executive Officer (second in command) for the new frigate Canterbury, then building in the UK. He was XO of HMNZS Canterbury from 1971 to 1973, where his reputation as a sailors’ leader was cemented. One Rating recalled “He was an inspirational officer who at times ate in the junior rates mess, allowed more casual clothes for sailors proceeding ashore in civvies, and introduced the beer bar and bbq on the flight deck for all officers and ratings.” Promoted to the rank of Commander in 1973 Bradley completed periods of shore duty, including the Joint Services Staff Course in Australia, but also spent much time taking a B.Com and Master of Public Policy and various affairs including with now deceased Dominion Journalist Helen Paske. Those who heard her description of the Captain couldn't believe such a person could exist in New Zealand; before being appointed in command of HMNZS Waikato in 1977, and as Captain, Eleventh Frigate Squadron. The title ‘Captain F11’ was passed to the senior CO of our four frigates. His command of Waikato included the dramatic rescue of an ill Russian Seaman from a Soviet trawler south of Stewart Island (the helicopter crew were awarded bravery medals). A long deployment to Canada and the US West Coast followed; during that time Waikato was integrated into a US Navy Destroyer Squadron – a unique step for the two Navies. While on one major exercise a US Navy helicopter reported an inflight emergency and needed to land. Although the exercise commander ordered another frigate (without a flight deck) to rescue the air crew (implicitly accepting the loss of the helicopter) Ian realised that Waikato’s flight deck (recently enlarged in the Devonport dockyard to accommodate the Lynx helicopter) could just accommodate the big Sea King that was in distress. He raced Waikato towards the American helicopter and it was able to land (diagonally) on the frigate with just moments of fuel remaining. Subsequently the US naval aviators could not do enough for Waikato wherever it went on the West Coast. In his book ‘Don’t Rock the Boat’ Ian has left a detailed account of Waikato’s diplomatic and representational role during what were high-profile port visits. In Vancouver he developed a relationship with a young Canadian Forces bandswoman. Although the age difference ultimately ended their romance, Ian wrote later that if he had married her maybe the events that ended his career would not have occurred. In 1979 he was appointed as Chief of Staff to the Commodore Auckland in the rank of Temporary Captain, with the responsibility of reorganising the Command Support Organisation. He initiated several innovative ideas, and he was appointed to command the new organisation on its inception in 1980. However, Bradley left Auckland one weekend for social reasons, and was subsequently accused of abandonment of his command and deserting his post. The Chief of Naval Staff of the time saw that as deserving punishment. Bradley was demoted to his substantive rank of Commander and allocated an office without a function and, proud and determined to the end, recognised he had effectively been relieved from the Navy and resigned from the RNZN. In the following two years he dabbled in TV film production and commentated on defence for the media and TV, notably clashing with the Minister of Defence over a poorly edited 1982 Listener article in which Bradley claimed that the Navy was going nowhere, that frigates like the RNZN Type 12's and Leanders, could not be economically modernised and that the performance of RNZN type frigates in the Falklands war had been disastrous and that they contributed nothing, and privately went further in his own defence, stating that frigates like HMS Plymouth far from performing well were so useless that the Argentine Navy and Air Force would never have wasted a bomb attacking, HMS Plymouth or Yarmouth, unless no other target was available and that the British Type 12s Plymouth and Yarmouth were effectively Leander class frigates of the same standard as HMNZS Canterbury and HMS Bachantee which the RNZN was receiving second hand, after their late 1960s reconstruction and were not of the same class as HMNZ Otago at all. It has since emerged that the Argentine pilots never attacked the elderly RN T12s in Falkland Sound and that the Task Force Commanders Admiral Sandy Woodward and Captain John Coward regarded the Plymouth and Yarmouth as heroic, but useless and worse and constantly anticipated their reduction to burning rubble. The main interest of Ian Bradley at the time was opposing the government's plan to convert to RNZN to submarines which he considered a fantasy. Bradley, who loved cars, in 1983 bought a garage in Devonport, taking a particular delight in serving many of the sailors who continued to support him. Bradley was determined to regain his honour as a commissioned officer. He brought a lawsuit against the Navy, which he lost, an outcome which he believed to be a miscarriage of justice. His position was that he would have eventually become Chief of the Defence Force, and certain powers found that prospect unacceptable, hence his dismissal. He continued to pursue the Navy and ultimately won an acknowledgement from the Governor-General that he had been unjustly treated. It was of course too late to reinstate his career. He went into local politics after his naval career, initially with the Devonport Borough Council (1983–86) and Auckland Regional Authority (1986–88) before serving in the Auckland Regional Council. Later, Ian joined the Department of Conservation where his work in the Auckland Conservancy proved to be dedicated, innovative and valuable. After leaving the navy, he also competed in Ironman events. He died suddenly in Charleston, South Carolina, USA, on 20 June 2015."

Mammadov was considered a likely candidate for the Presidential elections in October 2013, but was arrested in February 2013, prior to the race, in a move that was widely seen as politically motivated. In March 2014, Mammadov was sentenced to 7 years in jail. He currently remains in jail, in spite of extensive international protests against his arrest and sentence, and a finding by the European Court of Human Rights in his favor."

From International Falls, Anderson entered politics at approximately the same time that he was elected union president at the M & O Paper Company, the International Falls paper mill where he worked. A Democrat, he represented the old District 64 and 64B and, later, District 3A. The sprawling district included all or portions of Beltrami, Itasca, Koochiching, Lake of the Woods and St. Louis counties in the northern part of the state. Anderson served as majority leader of the House from 1973 to 1981, and again, briefly, in 1993 before becoming Speaker of the House in September 1993, a position he held until 1997. He continued to serve in the legislature until 2007, opting not to run for re-election in 2006 due to health concerns. Anderson fought in World War II as a United States Navy pilot from 1942 to 1945, earning the Air Medal for his performance. The Air Medal is awarded to any person who, while serving in any capacity in or with the Armed Forces of the United States, distinguishes themselves by meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight. He also helped create Minnesota's memorial to World War II veterans. Anderson died at Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids on November 17, 2008. He was buried in St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Cemetery in International Falls. On April 15, 2009, Governor Tim Pawlenty approved a bill designating U.S. Highway 53 from Virginia to International Falls as the Irv Anderson Memorial Highway."
