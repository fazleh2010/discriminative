He became a Quaker in 1980. He first came to Ottawa in his teens when his father worked there. Doucet played for the Carleton Ravens football team for one season, and then moved to the University of Toronto. A football injury took him out of that sport and into the sport of rowing. In his younger days, he spent a summer working in a rock copper mine in British Columbia and helped build the National Arts Centre as a construction worker. Before entering politics, Doucet was a municipal affairs policy advisor."

  "text" : "Charles John Taylor (1826–1897) was a New Zealand politician. He was the second son of General Taylor (1790-1868) of West Tamaki. Charles was a judge in India, before buying land in the Auckland area and a director of The Bank of New Zealand, of which his brother, Allan Kerr Taylor, was auditor Charles John Taylor had two brothers and one half brother who lived in Auckland: The names of their properties later became the names of the suburbs - Charles John Taylor at Glen Orchard (now St Heliers), William Innes Taylor at Glen Innes, and Richard James Taylor at Glen Dowie. The half brother Allan Kerr Taylor lived in Mount Albert in a house called Alberton; it is possibly to differentiate themselves from the main part of the family that the Mt Albert Talyors adopted Allan's middle name as part of their surname - becoming the Kerr Taylors or Kerr-Taylors. This may well have simply grown out of the social conventions of the period. Charles John Taylor served in the 1st New Zealand Parliament and the 2nd New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Southern Division; (consisting of the Waikato, Bay of Plenty, and East Cape regions). He resigned on 13 April 1858. From the 1861 election, he served in the 3rd New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Raglan electorate. He resigned from Raglan before the end of that term on 1 April 1865. His election statement for the 1861 election read, \"Having always held opinions opposed to a centralising policy, I should vote for the repeal of the \"New Provinces Act.” I am prepared to unite with the other representatives of this province in obtaining a sweeping reduction in the expenditure now lavished on an overgrown and daily increasing official staff, and to act in concert with those gentlemen that Auckland may hold the prominent position due to her in the government of the colony.\" In that election he defeated Theodore Haultain. He represented the Southern Division electorate on the 3rd Auckland Provincial Council from 26 October 1860 to 12 September 1861. He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 31 March 1869. His membership lapsed on 26 July 1878 through absence, when he and his family went to live in England."

  "text" : "Caroline Selina Ganley, CBE, JP (née Blumfield; 16 September 1879 – 3 August 1966) was an English Labour Co-operative Party politician. Ganley was born in Plymouth, the daughter of a tailor. She became politically active in 1906 in opposition to the Boer War, and joined the Social Democratic Federation that year. She actively supported women's suffrage and helped set up what would become the Women's Labour League branch in Battersea. She became involved in the British Committee of the International Congress for Peace and Freedom in 1914. Ganley was a school manager and governor, becoming a Justice of the Peace (JP) in 1920, one of London's first female magistrates. She joined the Labour and Co-operative Parties and served on Battersea Council (1919–25, 1953–65) and the London County Council (1925–29 and 1934–37), and was a member of the London County Education Committee. She contested the Paddington North seat at the 1935 general election. At the 1945 general election, Ganley was elected as Member of Parliament for Battersea South. She narrowly held the seat in 1950 but was defeated by Ernest Partridge in 1951. Ganley was elected a director of the West London Co-operative Society in 1918 and served on the board of its successor, the London Co-operative Society for many years and as President 1942-46, its first woman president. She held national positions in the Women's Co-operative Guild and was one of the speakers at its diamond jubilee celebrations at the Royal Albert Hall in 1943. She was awarded the CBE in 1953."

  "text" : "(This article is about the Sinn Féin politician. For the American ice hockey player, see Connor Murphy.) Conor Terence Murphy (born 10 July 1963) is an Irish republican Sinn Féin politician who is the Member of the Legislative Assembly of Northern Ireland for Newry and Armagh. He served as the Member of Parliament for Newry and Armagh from 2005-2015. Murphy was born in Camlough, South Armagh and joined the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the 1981 hunger strikes. In 1982 he was sentenced to five years in prison for IRA membership and possession of explosives. Between 1989 and 1997, he was a Sinn Féin councillor on Newry and Mourne District Council for The Fews area, in South Armagh and South Down, and served as his party's group leader at that level. In 1998, Murphy was elected as one of his party's two Northern Ireland Assembly members for Newry and Armagh. He was re-elected, with two party colleagues, to the Assembly in 2003. He lives in Camlough, County Armagh with his wife Catherine, his daughter Áine and his son Oisín. He attended St Colman's College, Newry, Queen's University of Belfast (QUB), and the University of Ulster. In 2001, he contested the Newry and Armagh Westminster seat, coming second to incumbent Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). When Mallon decided not to contest the seat again, Murphy became the clear favourite to win and was elected on 5 May 2005. He refused to take his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in line with the abstentionist policy of Sinn Féin. In the Northern Ireland Assembly, he served as the Minister for Regional Development in the Northern Ireland Executive from 8 May 2007 until 16 May 2011. While on a tour of UK party conferences in autumn 2005, he became the first Irish republican to address the Conservative Party conference and caused controversy by refusing to express regret over the Brighton hotel bombing. In 2011, while Minister for Regional Development, Murphy appointed Sean Hogan, a Catholic, as head of Northern Ireland Water, turning down the applications of four Protestants on the shortlist. A tribunal subsequently awarded £150,000 damages for discrimination to one of these applicants, Alan Lennon, judging that Hogan was appointed because \"he was not from a Protestant background and because he was known to the minister and his (then Sinn Fein) ministerial colleagues Michelle Gildernew and Caitriona Ruane, who were consulted about the appointment.\" The tribunal found Murphy's evidence was \"implausible and lack[ing] credibility\", and that, during Murphy's tenure at the Department for Regional Development, there was a \"material bias against the appointment of candidates from a Protestant background\". Murphy disputed the finding which he said branded him \"sectarian\". Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness defended him, claiming Murphy doesn't have \"a sectarian bone in his body\". In December 2012, Murphy appeared as a witness at Belfast High Court in the case of Declan Gormley, whom Murphy had sacked in 2010 from his post as a non-executive director of NI Water. Gormley sued Sinn Féin over two press releases which he argued were defamatory. Gormley was subsequently offered £80,000 in damages."

He was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. Carmen Provenzano was a graduate of St. Mary's College in the Sault. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Windsor, and a law degree (LLB) from Queen's University in Kingston. On graduation, he started his legal career in the city of Sault Ste. Marie's legal department, and for 25 years was self-employed in legal private practice in the Sault, specializing in municipal and planning law. He served as a charter member of the Algoma District Health Council, and for 13 consecutive years as a trustee on the Sault Ste. Marie Board of Education, where he served on all committees, including finance (chair) and salary negotiation. Provenzano was the past chair of the Northern Ontario Liberal caucus. After his election to Parliament in 1997 and re-election in 2000, he served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs, and was on several standing committees of the House of Commons, including fisheries and oceans (vice-chair), government operations and natural resources (vice-chair), and national defence and veterans affairs. He was also a member of the parliamentary steel caucus. As the Sault's MP, he considered his involvement in the successful restructuring of Algoma Steel a significant personal achievement. He was married to his wife Ada for nearly forty years, and together they had four children. Provenzano died from a sudden heart attack on July 27, 2005. His nephew Christian Provenzano ran unsuccessfully for the Liberals in his former riding during the 2006 federal election and the 2011 federal election, and was elected mayor of Sault Ste. Marie in the 2014 municipal election."

  "text" : "Chris Korwin-Kuczynski (born 1953) is a former Canadian municipal politician. He served as a councillor in Toronto from 1981 to 2003, and was the city's deputy mayor for a time. He was born in Toronto, and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from York University. He has been a director of the Polish-Canadian Congress, and has served as a special assistant to the federal Minister of State for Multiculturalism. He ran unsuccessfully for city council in 1980 as Chris Korwin but was successful on his second attempt, in a 1981 by-election. In 1992, Korwin-Kuczynski successfully urged that the music group Barenaked Ladies be banned from performing a concert in Nathan Phillips Square because he believed their name objectified women (Toronto Star, 20 July 2005). This decision was widely ridiculed, and gave considerable publicity to the then-obscure band. Korwin-Kuczynski was a member of the council's right-wing, and was a frequent ally of fellow councillor Tom Jakobek (Toronto Star, 29 November 1994). Kyle Rae has suggested that Korwin-Kuczynski became isolated on council when Jakobek left in 2000 (Globe and Mail, 16 September 2003). In 1993, Korwin-Kuczynski was removed as chair of the Toronto Board of Health after criticizing a strongly worded AIDS prevention pamphlet published by the AIDS Committee of Toronto (Toronto Star, 23 January 1993). He had suggested that the Committee, which received significant support from Toronto's gay community, be denied city funding if it continued publishing such materials (Globe and Mail, 25 January 1995). Referring to his dismissal after the vote, he commented, \"[t]he only real issue I think this all stems from is AIDS, the whole issue surrounding the gay issue\" (Toronto Star, 22 January 1993). Kyle Rae, who is openly gay, has said that Korwin-Kuczynski was anti-gay during the early 1990s but later changed his views. In 2003, Rae was quoted as saying, \"He's now generally supportive of these issues, but that didn't come easily.\" He opposed a 1996 municipal bill that banned smoking in restaurants and bars, and requested that provincial Premier Mike Harris veto the measure (Montreal Gazette, 8 July 1996). Korwin-Kuczynski considered running for the Liberal nomination in Parkdale—High Park in the 1997 federal election, but ultimately declined (Toronto Star, 16 February 1997). He retired from the council in 2003, amid rumours that he would move into consulting work (Toronto Star, 24 December 2003). He endorsed Dennis Mills's bid for re-election in the 2004 federal election, and a newspaper report from the period suggest that he was considering running as a Liberal candidate in the next federal election (Globe and Mail, 22 December 2003). On September 27, 2006, he filed papers to run in the Toronto municipal election, 2006 in Ward 14. However the next day he withdrew his nomination. This allowed him to retain a fundraising surplus of $21,742 leftover from his last campaign. If he hadn't done this the money would have flowed into the city coffers. Korwin-Kuczynski is a former honorary Captain of the Canadian Navy, and once served as a Director on the board of the Royal Canadian Military Institute in Toronto. His nickname is K-K."

  "text" : "Chris Bombolas (born 12 May 1960) (often known as Bomber) is a communications and media specialist, and a television and radio presenter. A former sports reporter for 21 years with the Nine Network in Brisbane. A former Australian politician, he served for one term as the Labor member for Chatsworth in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 2006 to 2009. Bombolas was born in Newcastle, New South Wales. Whilst working for the Qld Police Dept he graduated from the Queensland University of Technology with a Bachelor of Business degree in Communications. He became a radio host and worked for 4BC, 4BK and Triple M, before joining the Channel Nine as a sports presenter. In July 2006, Bombolas believed he could \"make a difference in my community\", and announced his intention to run for the Australian Labor Party in the seat of Chatsworth in the 2006 election. Bombolas won the seat against the incumbent member Michael Caltabiano of the Liberal Party. On 9 July 2007, Bombolas became Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister for Sport and Local Government, Andrew Fraser. Bombolas announced on 19 February 2009 that he would not contest the 2009 state election. In June 2009, Bombolas became the Chairman of the A-league football club Brisbane Roar. His controversial decision to replace coach Frank Farina with Ange Postecoglou saw the Brisbane Roar win the record for the longest unbeaten run at the top level of any Australian football code, which stands at 36 league matches without defeat.[3] Brisbane Roar are also the first and only club to win back to back A-League Championships.[4] In 2012, Bombolas was asked to join Hancock Coal/GVK as their External Affairs Advisor (Media & Corporate Communications Advisor). He now works as a freelance Media and Communications Specialist, plus is a qualified Auctioneer."

First elected in 1993, he took office on January 1, 1994. In 1997, he defeated challenger Nick Wichowski to win a second term. Term limits prevented him from running a third consecutive time. He was succeeded by former mayor Jack Ford in 2002. Following his first administration, Finkbeiner served on the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority board. He joined the ABC affiliate in Toledo and hosted Carty & Company, a Sunday morning public affairs show. He also contributed a weekly editorial segment, It's Just Not Right! Finkbeiner left WTVG in May 2005. On June 30, 2005, Finkbeiner announced that he would seek a third term as mayor. He won the Toledo mayoral primary, winning roughly 37% of the vote in comparison to 29% earned by incumbent Ford. On November 8, 2005, Finkbeiner was re-elected mayor. Finkbeiner was sworn in for his third term as mayor in a private ceremony on January 3, 2006. Finkbeiner has proved to be a very controversial mayor for the city of Toledo due to many of his policies, behavior, and public gaffes (see \"Controversy\" section). Toward the end of Finkbeiner's third term as mayor a recall effort drive to remove him from office was successfully put on the ballot but was ultimately struck down by the Ohio Supreme Court due to technicalities. Carty announced that his third run as mayor will be his final one and he would not seek re-election. According to city finance records verified by the Toledo Blade Finkbeiner left the city with a 48 million dollar deficit  which was inherited by Ohio Fire Marshall Michael P. Bell, an Independent, who succeeded Carty Finkbiener in 2010. Finkbeiner currently resides with his wife, Amy Finkbeiner, in South Toledo. He has three children: Ryan, Jenny, and Katie, and five grandchildren. Carlton Finkbeiner announced plans to run for a fourth term as mayor of Toledo on August 29, 2015."

  "text" : "Charles Wainman Burson was a legal counsel and Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States under Al Gore. He assumed the position of legal counsel from Kumiki Gibson in February 1997 after serving almost a decade as Tennessee Attorney General. In 1999 Charles Burson became Gore's Chief of Staff, replacing Ron Klain who resigned in August of that year. Burson is the son of Josie Burson and Leo Burson. He grew up in Shelby County, Tennessee, where he graduated from Central High School in Memphis in 1962. Burson received his Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of Michigan, his Master of Arts from the University of Cambridge, and his J.D. from Harvard Law School. Burson was a friend of Gore for over three decades at the time of his appointment as Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States. Charles Burson first became friends with the future Vice President in 1968 during the time Gore was studying Tennessee history at Memphis State University. In 1984 he was the chairman of Gore's senatorial campaign. This continued a family tradition of involvement with the Gores. Burson's parents were active in Tennessee Democratic politics, and his mother had held a position in Albert Gore Sr.'s senatorial campaign in 1958. Before joining the White House, Charles Burson held a variety of public and private roles. From 1970 until 1988, he worked in private practice as a lawyer. He briefly flirted with active politics in the 1978 when he lost a race to Republican Ed Williams for the East Memphis seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. In 1988 he was appointed the Tennessee Attorney General. In this capacity, Burson served on a number of public legal bodies. He was a member of the Tennessee Board of Law Examiners, of the Tennessee Code Commission and of the Commission on the Future of the Judicial System. Burson also represented the state several times before the Supreme Court of the United States. One notable case he argued was Burson v. Freeman, which established a state's ability to regulate election advertising on voting day. After his time in the White House, Burson served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the global agribusiness corporation, Monsanto. Burson is married to Bunny Burson and has two daughters, Clare and Kate. He presently resides in St. Louis, Missouri, teaches at the Washington University School of Law and is of counsel to the St. Louis law firm Bryan Cave."

  "text" : "Christopher Knudsen (4 October 1843 – 28 July 1915) was a Norwegian priest and politician for the Conservative Party. He was Minister of Education and Church Affairs from 1905 to 1906. Knudsen was born in Drammen as a son of railroad worker Knud Larssen (1814–66) and Marie A. Christophersen Aaserud (1812–1890). He was married twice; first from February 1869 to Marie Charlotte Andrea Hermanstorff (1849–1873), then from September 1874 to Ida Regine Lohne (1855–1949). He was an uncle of politician Knud Christian Knudsen. He finished his secondary education in 1861, graduated with the cand.theol. degree in 1867, and in 1879 he became vicar in the newly established parish of Nedre Eiker. When Nedre Eiker became its own municipality in 1885, he sat in the municipal council and on the school board and was elected mayor. He left Nedre Eiker in 1886, and became a curate in Drammen. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from that city in 1894 and 1897. He was then elected for a third term in 1900 from the constituency Tønsberg, where he had been appointed vicar. On 11 March 1905, when Michelsen's Cabinet assumed office, Knudsen was appointed Norwegian Minister of Education and Church Affairs. This cabinet oversaw the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905. Knudsen left the cabinet on 26 January 1906."

During his time on the Court of Appeal he was an outspoken critic of recent legislation, in particular the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which he criticised as being poorly drafted, saying: \"If a history of criminal legislation ever comes to be written it is unlikely that 2003 will be identified as a year of exemplary skill in the annals of Parliamentary drafting.\" In 1957 he obtained a degree in law from the University of Leeds. He went on to do his BCL at Wadham College, Oxford, where he has acted as an Honorary Fellow since 1993. In 2009 he said the Civil Nuclear Constabularies \"approach to covert activity is conspicuously professional'. He found that the system for storing the intelligence gained from informers was 'working well' and that 'senior officers regard covert surveillance as a long-term requirement\"."

In the 38th Parliament of British Columbia, she sat on the Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture and the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts, as well as serving as the opposition critic on the Employment and Income Assistance ministry, followed by the critic on child care, early childhood development, and women's issues. In the 39th Parliament she acted as a deputy speaker before returning to her role as critic on the children and family development portfolio. In the 40th Parliament, she was the critic on transportation and BC Ferries and, in that role, produced a report comparing the BC Ferries system with the Washington State Ferries system and introduced the Provincial Shipbuilding Act in both 2014 and 2015 seeking to have future ferries constructed in Canada. Originally from England, Trevena has a background in journalism having worked as a Canadian correspondent for British media. After she immigrated, she worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and then as a public information officer for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. After moving to British Columbia with her husband, she started her own business specializing communication strategies. She unsuccessfully filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal after being fired from a job because of her political affiliation. She was an advocate of renovations to the hospitals in Campbell River and Comox, opposing the health authority's plans to replace them with a new regional hospital near Courtenay. In November 2010, Trevena was one of thirteen party members to ask for a leadership convention, resulting in the resignation of Carole James as leader of the BC NDP. She endorsed John Horgan in both the 2011 and 2014 leadership elections."

  "text" : "Stanley, a descendant of James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, was born on November 20, 1842, in Saybrook, Connecticut, to Rev. Dr. Harvey Stanley and Mary Anne (Kinne) Stanley of North Carolina. In 1851, he moved to Prince George's County, Maryland with his parents, where he attended local schools and received private tutoring. He was a Confederate American Civil War veteran, having served as a private in Company B of the First Regiment, Maryland Cavalry from 1862 to 1865. After his military service, Stanley taught school and studied law under General Thomas Bowie; he was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1869. Stanley married his first wife, Ella Lee Hodges (January 1841 – October 1, 1881) on November 26, 1871; the couple had no children. Margaret Snowden became Stanley's second wife on September 11, 1884. Nine children were born of this marriage, six of whom survived to 1907: Harvey; Charles H. Stanley, Jr.; William; John Snowden; Margaret Snowden; and Elizabeth Hopkins."

  "text" : "Charlotte Anne Laws (born May 11, 1960) is an American author, talk show host, community activist, animal rights advocate, anti-revenge porn activist, former Los Angeles politician, and actress under the stage name Missy Laws. Laws was a weekly commentator on the television show The Filter with Fred Roggin from August 2009 until 2013 when the show went off the air. One of her episodes was nominated for an Emmy. Laws was also a co-host on the Internet show Every Way Woman from 2008 - December 2013, and she hosted her own Los Angeles TV show called Uncommon Sense from October 2007 until September 2010. Laws and her guests discussed news and current events. Laws is a former member of the Greater Valley Glen Council in Valley Glen, California. She was termed out of office in 2012, after serving four two-year terms. She was the first politician to run on the platform that she represents all beings in her district, not just the humans whom she maintains are the elite. She promotes moving from a democracy to what she calls an omniocracy, a government with representation for all living beings. In May 2006, Laws was appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to serve on the city’s 912 Commission, which was also called the Neighborhood Council Review Commission. In 1999, the Los Angeles City Charter mandated that a commission would be formed seven years later to review the progress, successes and failures of the city’s Neighborhood Council system. Laws is the founder and president of two organizations: the Directors of Animal Welfare (DAW) and the League for Earth and Animal Protection (LEAP). In 2006, Laws was the recipient of the Los Angeles Animal Humanitarian Award. Laws is a vegan and an advocate of that diet."

From 1962 to 1965 he was mayor of Buffalo, New York; he holds the distinction of being the last Republican mayor of that city to date. He was born into a Polish-American family in Buffalo on August 17, 1904. The family operated a grocery store at 55 Gittere Street. He attended Hutchinson Central High School. He turned down a basketball scholarship to Canisius College in Buffalo in order to play professionally to earn money. He played with the once world champion German Orioles and the Buffalo Lincolns basketball teams, and also played semi-pro baseball with the Easter Brands. He boxed with the Western New York AAU and was a contender for the U.S. Olympic boxing team. He was married to a Polish-American woman, Stephanie Adamski. His family started Walden Bottling Works in 1924; he managed the company in his spare time. In late 1942, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces as a private and was sent to Officers' Training School. He saw service in the U.S. Southwest before serving five months in the Pacific Theater during World War II. In April 1946 he was discharged as a lieutenant-colonel. He was active in veterans organizations. In 1951, Kowal was elected Buffalo city comptroller on the Republican ticket. He was defeated in his run for mayor in the 1957 election by Frank A. Sedita, but prevailed in the mayoral election held on November 7, 1961. He served a single term as mayor. On September 28, 1966, he died in his sleep."

  "text" : "Constantin Mille (December 21, 1861 – February 20, 1927) was a Romanian journalist, novelist, poet, lawyer, and socialist militant, as well as a prominent human rights activist. A Marxist for much of his life, Mille was noted for his vocal support of peasant emancipation, for his early involvement with the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR), and his presence at the head of several magazines, culminating in his association with the moderate left-wing newspapers Adevărul and Dimineaţa. After serving as an independent member of the Chamber of Deputies for one mandate (1899-1903), he aligned his views with those of Take Ionescu, and became a supporter of Romania's entry into World War I alongside the Entente Powers. In addition to his political career, Mille was the author of two autobiographical novels (Dinu Millian, 1884, and O viaţă, 1914)."

  "text" : "Chris Trotter (born c. 1956) is a left-leaning political commentator in New Zealand. He is the editor of the occasional Political Review magazine, and is a regular speaker, orator and singer at left-wing, union and socialist events. Trotter has worked for unions and was on the New Zealand council of the Labour Party. He writes the \"From the Left\" column in the Dominion Post, and has also contributed to the Independent Financial Review. He makes semi-frequent television appearances as a political commentator. He has attracted criticism from other broad left critics who regard his knowledge of feminist, indigenous and LGBT politics to be insignificant, particularly insofar as their own distributive justice dimensions are concerned Trotter is the author of No Left Turn, a political history of New Zealand. Novelist, poet and critic C K Stead described the book as \"a dashingly written and persuasive elegy for the Scandinavian-style socialist democracy New Zealand might have been, and at the same time a realistic (though at times appropriately angry) acknowledgement that, given the forces, internal and external, ranged against it, the chances of it happening, and lasting, were never very good.\" In February 2008, he said that Helen Clark should stand down before the election and be replaced by Phil Goff, who he thought may have been Labour's only hope of regaining ground with struggling families. He has since recanted, arguing that Goff should have stood down in his turn before the New Zealand general election, 2011, arguing that David Cunliffe should replace him."

  "text" : "Sir Charles Edward Mallet (2 December 1862 – 21 November 1947), was a British historian and Liberal politician. He was knighted in 1917. He first stood for parliament at the 1900 General Election when he was the unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the Conservative seat of Salford West. Mallet was returned to Parliament for Plymouth in 1906. In 1908 he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Walter Runciman who was President of the Board of Education. In February 1910 Asquith was considering him as a possible Chief Whip but was dissuaded by the outgoing Chief Whip Jack Pease who felt he was out of sympathy with many leading Liberals over the Lords. In March 1910 Prime Minister H. H. Asquith appointed him Financial Secretary to the War Office, a position he held until he was defeated in the December general election of the same year. He sought a return to parliament at the Salford North by-election, 1917 as a Coalition Liberal candidate but was defeated by an Independent Labour candidate. He did not contest the 1918 General Election. He was Honorary Secretary of the Free Trade Union. He became a supporter of the official Liberal party that opposed the Coalition Government. He sought to make a return to parliament standing as Liberal candidate for South Aberdeen, in 1922 without success. He tried again in 1923 without success. He had published two works on Liberal politicians; Mr Lloyd George, a Study (1930) and Herbert Gladstone, a Memoir (1932). His book on Lloyd George was entirely devoted to the shortcomings of the Liberal Leader."

  "text" : "Charles Cecil Cotes (7 April 1846 – 9 August 1898) was a British landowner and Liberal politician. Cotes was born in 1846, eldest surviving son of John Cotes of Woodcote Hall near Newport, Shropshire (himself a former MP) and his wife Lady Louisa Jenkinson, daughter of Charles Jenkinson, 3rd Earl of Liverpool, and thus nephew of the former Prime Minister, the 2nd Earl. He was educated at Eton College, then entered Christ Church, Oxford in 1864, graduating as B.A. in 1869. Cotes served in the South Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry as lieutenant before being promoted captain in 1869. This regiment amalgamated to form the unified Shropshire Yeomanry in 1872, and he continued to serve with them until he retired in 1880. Cotes first sought election to Parliament for the then two-member borough seat of Shrewsbury at a by-election following the death of William Clement in 1870 and polled 1,253 votes but was defeated by a majority of 38 by his Conservative opponent, Douglas Straight. Cotes petitioned against the result but the case was dismissed in court with costs. He entered Parliament for Shrewsbury at the 1874 general election, and held the seat until 1885. That year Shrewsbury was reduced to a one-member seat and Cotes did not seek further election to Parliament. When the Liberals came to power in 1880 under William Ewart Gladstone, he was appointed a Junior Lord of the Treasury, which he remained until the government fell in 1885. Following his father's death in 1874, Cotes succeeded to his estates in Shropshire and Staffordshire in England and Montgomeryshire in Wales, which in 1876 amounted to 6,470 acres with an income of £8.860 a year. He had Woodcote Hall rebuilt after a disastrous fire. He reputedly owned the first motor car registered in Shropshire, vehicle registration number \"AW1\". Cotes was a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for the counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire and at the time of his death was a trustee of the Harper Adams Agricultural College which was then being erected near Newport. Cotes died suddenly at Woodcote Hall, of a heart attack, in August 1898, aged 52, and was buried on 12 August in Woodcote churchyard. He was unmarried and his estates passed to his brother."

  "text" : "Catryna Louise Bilyk (née Goninon; born 7 February 1959) is an Australian politician. She has been a Labor member of the Australian Senate since July 2008, representing the state of Tasmania. Bilyk was elected to serve a six-year term in the Senate at the 2007 federal election, after being placed in the third position on the Australian Labor Party's Tasmanian ticket. She was elected to the sixth Senate seat for Tasmania, on preferences distributed from Andrew Wilkie, the Australian Greens' second candidate for the Senate in Tasmania in the 2007 election. It was second time lucky for Bilyk, who had also been preselected in third spot on the Labor Senate ticket in Tasmania at the 2001 federal election, but failed to win a seat. Bilyk was born in Hobart. She worked as an industrial officer for trade unions and has been ALP National Vice-President. Bilyk is linked with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA). She has worked as a nurse and a child carer. She is married with two adult children. In March 2008, she was diagnosed with two benign brain tumours, which were surgically removed. On 27 February 2016, Catryna Bilyk announced that she now supports marriage equality. Now a majority of Senators within the Australian Senate support marriage equality."

Molloy first entered Queensland state parliament as one of a number of newly elected Labor MPs following the party's landslide win at the 2001 state election. She was subsequently re-elected at the 2004 state election. In 2006, Molloy publicly opposed her party's policy to build a dam on the Mary River. This stance resulted in her disendorsement as a Labor Party candidate in June 2006. She continued to sit as a Labor MP before quitting the party in August 2006. Thereafter, Molloy sat out the remainder of her term as an independent before being defeated at the 2006 state election. The following year, Molloy unsuccessfully contested the federal seat of Wide Bay, also in an independent capacity. In the 2009 state election, she unsuccessfully re-contested Noosa. Molloy was born in East Melbourne, Victoria. She was married to Ivan Molloy, who was the endorsed Labor candidate for Fairfax at the 2004 federal election."

  "text" : "Charles James Mathew, CBE, KC (24 October 1872 – 8 January 1923) was a British barrister and Labour politician. He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Whitechapel and St Georges in the 1922 general election, but died seven weeks later. The second son of Sir James Charles Mathew, a Lord Justice of Appeal, Charles James Mathew was educated at The Oratory School, Edgbaston, Birmingham and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1897 and took silk in 1913, specialising in Chancery cases. He was also an expert in trade union law. A member of the London County Council since 1910, Mathew was also a member of the Statutory Committee on War Pensions and Chairman of the Special Grants Committee. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1917. Mathew's political views had moved steadily closer to the Labour Party, and he was selected by the party to fight the Whitechapel and St. George's constituency at the 1922 General Election. At the poll, he defeated the incumbent Liberal MP, James Kiley by just 428 votes. Mathew died, aged 50, after an operation, less than two months after his election, becoming one of the shortest-serving MPs in history. At the subsequent by-election Harry Gosling held the seat for Labour. A Roman Catholic, he married in 1896, Anna, daughter of James Cassidy, of Monasterevin, County Kildare. There were two sons and a daughter. His elder son, Sir Theobald Mathew, later became the Director of Public Prosecutions."

He was one of thirteen children of William Wright, bookmaker of Tyldesley, near Manchester. At the age of nine he began work as a \"piecer\" in a local cotton mill. The only education he received was by attending night schools. At the age of fifteen he became a spinner, and rose to become manager of the mill in 1830. In 1841 he became manager of Ormerod and Hardcastles Mill, Bolton.In 1845 he established his own cotton-spinning business in partnership with Henry Barton. In 1855 the partnership was dissolved, and Caleb Wright and Company, Barnfield Mills, Tyldesley, established. Wright was a Unitarian, a member of the congregation at Chowbent Chapel where he succeeded his father as organist. Wright became involved in Liberal politics, and was chairman of Tyldesley Local Board and president of the local Mechanics' Institute. In the 1885 general election Caleb Wright was invited to stand as the candidate for the newly created Leigh division by the Liberal party. His Tory opponent was Lees Knowles who polled 3,725 votes as against 4,261 for Wright. He was elected as the first member of parliament for the new constituency of Leigh. He was re-elected at the next two general elections, before retiring from parliament in 1895. Politically Wright was an advanced radical, and supported both Home Rule for Ireland and women's suffrage. He was also a member of the Liberation Society which sought the disestablishment of the Church of England. Caleb Wright died at his home, Lower Oak, in Shakerley, Tyldesley in 1898 aged 87. He was a Unitarian and is buried at Chowbent Chapel."

He became a partner in the family company, John Needham and Sons of Manchester, iron and steel merchants. He stood as Liberal candidate for the constituency of Manchester South West at the January 1910 general election, but was defeated by the Conservative, Arthur Colefax. The position was reversed at the ensuing election in December, when Needham unseated Colefax to become a member of parliament. He held the seat until 1918. After leaving parliament, Needham was knighted in 1919, and expanded his business interests. He became chairman of the Manchester and Liverpool District Banking Company in 1922. He remained chairman of the company (renamed the District Bank) until 1936. He was chairman of the National Boiler and General Insurance Company and was also a director of the London and North Eastern Railway, the Manchester Ship Canal and the Alliance Assurance company. Outside of business, he was chairman of Lancashire County Cricket Club from 1941 to 1943. He married Florence White in 1902, and they had one daughter before her death in 1905.

  "text" : "Christine Mary Robertson (born 5 October 1948) is an Australian politician and former Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, serving from 2003 until her retirement in 2011. Robertson was born on 5 October 1948 in Wollongong to Walter Edward Carr and Diana Ida McGinness. She attended various primary schools in New South Wales, such as East Tamworth Primary School. She completed her secondary studies at J J Cahill Memorial High School in 1965. She sought a career in nursing and obtained a General Nursing Training Certificate in 1969. She worked as a Registered Nurse at various hospitals including, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Royal South Sydney Hospital, Royal North Shore Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and Tamworth Base Hospital. She pursued further studies in nursing and obtained a Bachelor of Health Science in 1990 from Charles Sturt University. She became a Health Education officer in 1986 and in 1997 became the Manager, and then the Director of Population Health for the New England Area Heath Service. In 1998 she became the Director of the New England Area Health Service Research Institute and in 2003 became the Chair of the Australian Rural Health Research Collaboration Advisory Council. She joined the Tamworth Branch of the Australian Labor Party in 1980. She became the President of the Tamworth Base Hospital Branch of the NSW Nurses Association in the same year. She became its Secretary in 1982 and then its President in 1991, and then the Senior Vice President in 1998. She became a member of the Administrative Committee in 1995. She succeeded Garry Ryan to become the Secretary of the Rural and Provincial Affairs Committee from 1986 to 1990, and then its Chair until 1999, and continued as Chair of the Country Labor Committee. She was a Delegate to the National ALP Conference in 1991 and has been a delegate for every conference thereafter. In 1996 she became the Secretary of the Tamworth Subbranch of the Health Services Union. She is now a partner in a farming and small business. She first stood as a candidate for the Australian Labor Party in the 1995 New South Wales Election when she was unsuccessful in Tamworth which was retained by Independent Tony Windsor. She then stood for the Legislative Council in the 2003 election.She was placed eighth on the Labor Party Group ticket. She received the 16th highest quota at that election, and was elected to serve an eight-year term in the Council. In Parliament she has been a member of the Joint Select Committee on the Threatened Species Conservation Amendment (Biodiversity Banking) Bill 2006, a member of the General Purpose Standing Committee, a member of the Standing Committee on State Development, and a member of the Committee on the Health Care Complaints Commission. She was appointed a Temporary Chair of Committees in 2003 and held that role until 2007. She was also the Legislative Council Representative on the Council of the University of New England in 2003 and 2004. On 1 August 2004 Robertson was traveling in a car on the road outside of Tingha when a vehicle traveling on the wrong side of the road collided with her vehicle. Passers-by removed her from the car prior to the other car bursting into flames. Ambulance officers transported her to Inverell District Hospital for treatment. Robertson said that she had no memory of the accident, nor of the two weeks after the incident, but praised medical staff for her treatment. She is currently the chair of the Standing Committee on Law and Justice. The committee delivered a report on court proceedings involving children criminal defendants. The committee recommended that the names of children who commit crimes should continue to be suppressed so the \"stigma of being associated with a crime\" would not get in the way of the child’s future rehabilitation In 2008, Robertson came out in support of besieged Federal politician Belinda Neal signing an open letter with eight other female politicians condemning the media over their treatment of Neal. On the first day of the new Rees Government, she asked a Dorothy Dixer question but addressed it to the wrong Government Minister. She is married to Richard and has two sons. The media attempted to implicate her when her husband allegedly cut down trees without authority on their country property with the Sydney Daily Telegraph disrespecting her husband by calling him her partner instead of her husband."

  "text" : "Telfer serves on the Bend City Council, and was elected to the Oregon State Senate in the November 2008 elections, to succeed outgoing Senator Ben Westlund. Hers was the only seat that changed parties in the Senate in that election cycle; her campaign spent $300,000 to opponent Maren Lundgren's $12,000. The shift, however, left Democrats with an 18-12 majority, allowing them to pass increases to taxes and fees without Republican support. (A 1996 law requires a 3/5 supermajority in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly for such measures.) Telfer has lived in Bend since 1977. She has two daughters. She earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Denver, and did post-graduate work at Franklin University and the University of Oregon. She has taught at Central Oregon Community College and served as vice-chair on the Bend Development Board. In 2010, Telfer filed for the special election for Oregon State Treasurer, to complete the term of Ben Westlund, who died in office, but lost to Democratic incumbent Ted Wheeler in the November general election. In the Republican primary of the 2012 legislative elections, Telfer was defeated by Tim Knopp, a former state Representative and vice president of the Central Oregon Builders Association.

Hogan previously worked as Chief Counsel to Vice President Biden during his time in the United States Senate and served as Staff Director of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 1995, she assisted with the drafting of anti-terrorism legislation. She has experience with judicial nominations. During the confirmation process for Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, she was (metaphorically) Judge Sotomayor's sherpa. She holds a B.A. in art history from Oberlin College (1979), and a J.D. from the University of Virginia Law School (1984). She was Notes Editor of the Virginia Law Review, then a clerk for U.S. District Court judge Edward Norman Cahn in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. She was an associate at Williams & Connolly, before going to work for Biden (1991–1996). She advised Biden unofficially while she stayed home raising her children. She and her husband both contributed to Democratic National Committee (1992). She gave money to Ralph Neas (1997) in his unsuccessful attempt to unseat Connie Morella in Maryland's 8th congressional district. Her husband has consistently donated to his employer's (the Arent Fox law firm) political action committee; the firm appears to contribute to the party of the incumbent President of the United States."

  "text" : "(For other people named Charles Harrison, see Charles Harrison (disambiguation).) Charles Harrison (1 August 1835 – 24 December 1897) was a British Liberal Party politician. Harrison was born in Muswell Hill, Middlesex, and was the third son of Frederick Harrison, a stockbroker, and his wife, Jane Brice. He was educated at King's College School and King's College London. In 1858 he entered business as a solicitor at the firm of his uncle, also named Charles Harrison. He acquired a large practice in his own right, with major clients being the London Chatham and Dover Railway and the Law Fire Insurance Society. He became an advocate of the rights of tenants to purchase their properties and of the provision of housing for the working classes. In this he was in agreement with the policies of the Radical wing of the Liberal Party. In 1886 he married Lady Harriet Barlow. His active involvement with politics came with the creation of the London County Council in 1889. He was elected as one of the council's first members, representing Bethnal Green South West as a member of the Liberal-backed Progressive Party. He was a leading member of the council, and vice-chairman from 1892 – 1895. His interests in the government of the capital led him to call for the municipalisation of the London docks and the unification of the City of London with the county. On two occasions Harrison stood for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons on behalf of the Liberals. In 1892 he failed to be elected at Plymouth. He stood again at the ensuing general election in 1895, and became one of the town's two members of parliament, while continuing to hold his seat on the London County Council. Harrison became suddenly ill with inflammation of the throat at the funeral of Sir Frank Lockwood on 23 December 1897 and died at his London home on the following day from heart failure."

Harrison entered business with Mr B Devey, a wharfinger at Stourport-on-Severn. Among the goods that were dealt with on the wharf were locally produced carpets of George Harris. On Harris's retirement Harrison purchased his carpet manufacturing business, and continued to actively run the company until shortly before his death. Apart from his business activities, Harrison was a magistrate for Worcestershire and a member of the Stourport local board and a number of other institutions in the area. In 1874 he was invited to stand as Liberal candidate for the parliamentary borough of Bewdley in place of Augustus Anson who had retired from parliament. Harrison held the seat for the Liberals, defeating his Conservative opponent Stanley Leighton by 514 votes to 405. At the ensuing general election in 1880 Harrison was re-elected, defeating K E Webster by 598 votes to 530. However, Harrison was unseated on petition, and retired from parliamentary politics. Harrison made his home at Areley Court, Areley Kings, near Stourport. He married Elizabeth Augusta Kempson of Edgbaston, Birmingham in 1858. He died at his home in May 1888 after a long illness."

  "text" : "Chaudhary Brahm Prakash (1918–1993) played an important role in the Individual Satyagraha Movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1940 and was among the leaders of the ‘underground’ activities in Delhi during the ‘Quit India’ movement. He was imprisoned many times during the freedom struggle. He hailed from Shakurpur Village, a yadav dominated village in North-West Delhi. In the post-independence era, Prakash, a member of India's yadav community, served as Minister in charge of Planning and Development as well as the first Chief Minister of Delhi from 1952-55. His stints in the Parliament twice won him accolades as an able parliamentarian. He also made noteworthy contributions as the Union Cabinet Minister for Food, Agriculture, Irrigation and Cooperatives. The cause of depressed sections of the society, rural development and empowerment of the weaker sections were issues which were very close to the heart of Chaudhary Brahm Prakash. He was quick to realise the potential of cooperative societies in mitigating the hardships of the village folks. As early as in 1945, he started organising village and agriculture cooperatives. He was also a proponent of the Panchayati Raj institutions. He organised the National Union of Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Minorities in 1977 to work for the welfare of these weaker sections."

Prior to his presidential appointment as U.S. Attorney, Turner worked under his predecessor, Sidney I. Lezak, for 14 years. He was appointed as Lezak's replacement by President Ronald Reagan. As U.S. Attorney, Turner investigated sham marriages and immigration fraud organized by followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (now known as Osho) in Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, as well as other illegal activities including the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in The Dalles, Oregon. In 1985, high-ranking followers of Rajneesh plotted to murder Turner, carrying out steps including assembling a team, purchasing weapons, and performing surveillance on his office, home and car. Seven followers of Rajneesh were later convicted of conspiracy to assassinate him. While U.S. Attorney, Turner hired prosecutors Michael Mosman and Mark Bailey; both would later go on to serve as U.S. Attorney for Oregon. He retired in 1993, and was succeeded by Kristine Olson, who he had previously supervised as U.S. Attorney."

She represented District 4 (Oakland, California and Alameda, California), where she served three terms. Ward Allen became the first African American to serve as president of the California Commission on the Status of Women in 1983. In 1990, she made history again as an Oakland Port Commissioner who was elected among her colleagues to serve as president, making her the first woman to do so, and the longest African-American woman to achieve such stride with two terms. Almost a decade later, December 15, 2005, BART Director Ward Allen attained another major milestone as a woman in politics when she was elected among her colleagues on the BART Board of Directors to serve as its president and Lynette Sweet as its vice president, which made BART the first major transportation agency to be led by two African-American women in American history."

Marple was born in Melbourne and educated at Brighton, becoming a primary teacher specialising in helping children with learning difficulties. A member of the Australian Labor Party, she ran as a candidate for several federal elections, contesting the safe Coalition seat of Indi in 1980 and 1983 and running in the unwinnable fourth position on the Victorian Labor Senate ticket in 1984 and 1990. From 1987–90 she was chairperson of the party's Rural Policy Committee, and chairperson of the Conservation Policy Committee 1986–92. In 1992, Marple was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the Labor member for Altona. She was Shadow Minister for Natural Resources (1992–93) and Agriculture and Rural Affairs (1993–96). In 1996 she was defeated for preselection by Lynne Kosky of the party's Socialist Left faction. She then won preselection for the Legislative Council seat of Geelong, but was defeated."

  "text" : "Captain Charles Calvert (1688 – February 2, 1734) was the 14th Proprietary Governor of Maryland in 1720, at a time when the Calvert family had recently regained control of their proprietary colony. He was appointed governor by his cousin Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, who in 1721 came into his inheritance. Calvert worked to reassert the Proprietary interest against the privileges of the colonists as set out in the Maryland Charter, and to ease tensions between the Lords Baltimore and their subjects. Religious tension, which had been a source of great division in the colony, was much reduced under his governorship. Captain Calvert was replaced as governor in 1727 by his cousin Benedict Leonard Calvert, though he continued to occupy other colonial offices. He suffered from early senility and died in 1734."

She later served on the Michigan Association of School Boards Taxation Committee,. Saltonstall was elected to the Charlevoix County Commission in 2006, and served a three-year term on the Charlevoix County Commission on Aging. She unsuccessfully sought election to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2008. In March 2010, Saltonstall announced that she would challenge incumbent Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak. Saltonstall cited Stupak's authoring of the anti-abortion Stupak–Pitts Amendment to the proposed Affordable Health Care for America Act, as well as Stupak's disagreement with changes made to the amendment by the U.S. Senate. She has received vocal support from the abortion rights groups, NARAL and the National Organization of Women. NOW President Terry O’Neill told POLITICO, “I think Connie Saltonstall is going to be our next representative from Michigan's first district.” Stupak has since announced that he will not run for re-election. In May 2010, Saltonstall ended her candidacy after party establishment decided to back another candidate."

  "text" : "Charles Beard Izard (1829–1904) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament and lawyer in Wellington, New Zealand. He was born in Brighton, England, and educated at King's College London and Magdalene College, Cambridge, graduating in mathematics in 1854. After studying at Lincoln's Inn he was admitted to the bar in England. He married Miss Mary Ann Hayward from Sussex in 1859. She died in Wellington on 18 July 1900 aged 71 years. In 1860 they emigrated to Auckland, and that year moved to Wellington. He was a Crown solicitor and partner in the law firm that became Bell Gully. His son, Charles Hayward Izard, was a partner in that firm from 1882 to 1897. He was on the boards of local schools and local companies e.g. the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company and the Meat Export Company. He retired from the law in 1887 due to failing eyesight. He contested the 1881 election in the Foxton electorate, where he was second of six candidates, beaten by James Wilson. He represented the Wellington South and Suburbs electorate from 1887 to 1890, when he was defeated (for the Hutt electorate). His son Charles Hayward Izard was also a Member of Parliament."

Beginning in January 2009, he was the president of the Chartthaipattana Party. He was the younger brother of Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa. Born at Suphanburi, Chumpol held a Bachelor of Laws from the Thammasat University and an MPA from the Syracuse University. He worked as a civil servant and political science lecturer at the Thammasat University, before he entered politics in 1979. A member of the conservative-populist Thai Nation Party, he represented Suphan Buri Province in parliament. In the following years he held different high-rank government positions. In 1986 and 1992, he was Vice President of the House of Representatives. From 1997 to 1998 he was Minister of Education in Chuan Leekpai's cabinet. As he was no member of the Thai Nation Party's executive board, he was, unlike his brother, not banned from political activity by the Constitutional Court's ruling of 2 December 2008. So he could, as his brother's proxy, become leader of the Chartthaipattana Party, which is the de facto successor of the dissolved Thai Nation Party. After his grouping broke the coalition with the People's Power Party and joined the Democrat-led government, Chumpol became Minister of Tourism and Sports under Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. When the Pheu Thai Party led by Yingluck Shinawatra won the 2011 elections, Chumpol changed sides again, and directed his Chartthaipattana Party into the coalition with Pheu Thai. He kept the Tourism and Sports portfolio and was additionally appointed Deputy Prime Minister, on 9 August 2011. Chumpol Silpa-archa has been decorated with the Special Class of both the Order of the White Elephant and the Order of the Crown of Thailand. Chumpol died of heart failure on 21 January 2013, around 09:30 hours, at Ramathibodi Hospital, while holding the offices of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism and Sports."

In June 2015, Craig resigned as leader of the Conservative Party following allegations of inappropriate behaviour surrounding the party's former press secretary Rachel MacGregor and tensions with the party's governing board. Craig has since admitted to inappropriate conduct with MacGregor but has denied charges of sexual harassment. On 27 June, Colin Craig was formally suspended from the Conservative Party. Since then, his suspension has been invalidated which would enable Craig to contest the Conservative Party's leadership. On 16 November 2015, Craig announced that he would not be contesting the Conservative Party leadership in lieu of a police investigation against him over his Party's spending during the 2014 general election."

He was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1946 to 1964, representing the electorate of Darwin for both the Labor Party (1946-1956) and the Liberal Party (1956-1964). He served as a minister under Labor Premier Robert Cosgrove until his sudden floor-crossing defection in 1956. Bramich was promoted to Cabinet in November 1946 and was appointed Assistant Minister for Education and Transport, but was defeated in a caucus election for a reshuffle several months later. He returned to Cabinet in May 1948 following the defeat of Rowland Worsley, and was assigned Worsley's former role of Minister for Forests. He again lost his position in a caucus election, and again regained it after another vacancy in April 1949, being appointed Minister for Housing. Bramich suddenly resigned as Minister for Housing and from the Labor Party on 11 September 1956, costing the Labor government its majority in parliament. He claimed that his recommendations were being ignored and his decisions set aside. He was also facing party censure for having, while Acting Minister for Health, made a public statement claiming that his colleagues had \"deliberately frustrated\" his efforts to reconstitute a country hospitals board. Bramich initially claimed that he would sit on the crossbenches, but defected to the Liberal Party later that day. An attempt to install a Liberal government mid-term was only thwarted when Premier Robert Cosgrove called an early election, following a constitutional crisis around whether the Governor would allow him to dissolve parliament. Bramich had been expected to lose his seat at the subsequent election, but instead topped the Liberal poll in his seat. Bramich retired from politics in 1964 and died later that year."

He is remembered for his message \"Don't worry!\" while drinking a glass of tea in front of the cameras following the Chernobyl disaster that occurred on April 26, 1986, and downplaying the disaster's possible risk effects on human health caused by radioactivity released into the environment in the Black Sea Region, where Turkey's tea plantations are located. For this reason, he was nicknamed \"Bekerel Cahit\" (Cahit the Becquerel). Cahit Aral died of heart failure on November 1, 2011 in Istanbul. He was laid to rest at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery on November 3, 2011 following a state funeral and the religious funeral service at Levent Mosque."

He was appointed Assistant Minister for Health on 3 April 2012, but was expelled from the ministry for breaches of cabinet solidarity. Before entering parliament Dr Davis worked as the director of geriatric medicine at The Prince Charles Hospital. He has served as president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association and was the state chair of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. On 13 May 2014, Davis was sacked from Cabinet in response to his speaking against the government on a number of matters. Premier Campbell Newman said Davis had failed to observe the convention that cabinet members and assistant ministers are bound by collective decision making. Although Davis initially stated that he intended to retire at the next state election, he resigned from the Parliament on 23 May 2014. A 2014 Stafford by-election was held on Saturday 19 July 2014. On 25 July 2014, in an interview on the ABC's 7.30 Queensland, Davis stated that he had resigned from the Liberal National Party and had spoken to Australian Labor Party state secretary Anthony Chisholm about the potential for continuing his political career with Labor, potentially running in Newman's seat of Ashgrove. The following day, Leader of the Opposition Annastacia Palaszczuk stated that Davis was not a member of the Labor Party and would not be running as a Labor candidate. On the same day, Davis submitted his application to join the Labor Party, and also stated that he was interested in federal politics if he was unsuccessful in obtaining a state seat."

He was also for five years editor of the journal published by that society. On the passing of the Pharmacy Act in 1877, the Government appointed him one of the members of the Pharmacy Board, and on the retirement of Mr. Bosisto he was elected President. He was examiner in chemistry to the College of Pharmacy, and for some time acted as lecturer on chemistry, materia medica, and botany, pending the arrival of Professor A. H. Jackson, B.8o. In 1879 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Fitzroy in the Conservative interest. Mr. Blackett was President of the Royal Technological Commission; and when the Central Board of Health was formed he was offered the position of president, but declined it. In 1882 he was again returned for Fitzroy, but was defeated at the next general election, owing to his pronounced free-trade views. Mr. Blackett was appointed Government Analytical Chemist on the death of Mr. Johnson, in 1887, and is also a Fellow of the Chemical Society of London, and was co-examiner in chemistry to the Melbourne University, until he resigned the office. Mr. Blackett married Miss Margaretta Palmer in May 1870 at Stokesley, England."

  "text" : "Charles Hutchins Stewart (September 22, 1867 – June 18, 1936) was a four-term mayor of Melbourne, Florida from 1890 to 1891, and 1902 to 1905. He was born in Joliet, Illinois on September 22, 1867, the son of William F. Stewart (b. Ohio) and Julia Ann Hutchins (b. Maysville, Kentucky). He married Annie Mabel Nash in Titusville on May 24, 1888. She was the daughter of Clarence and Annie Hyatt Nash, a wealthy family from Norwalk, Connecticut with a home in Daytona. He and his wife Annie Mabel Nash Stewart came to Melbourne in 1888. They were well educated and cultured, but wanted to be pioneers. He was elected mayor in 1890 when he was only 23. He opened a hardware store and mortuary on New Haven Ave named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Frank Fee, who would also serve as mayor. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee and Stewart founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. In 1908, he was a presidential elector for the Republican Party. Documentation exists from as early as 1898 in the form of letters and invoices, books and newspaper articles reflecting his business was already located at 1002 E New Haven Ave, Melbourne, FL. In 1919, Stewart's Front Street store burned down, along with most of the downtown businesses in \"The Great Fire.\" After this time, the downtown was no longer in that area, but moved to the west side of U.S. 1. Stewart moved his business to New Haven Avenue. He may have moved his business to 1002 E New Haven Ave before the fire of 1919. In 1920, he was a co-founder of the Melbourne Golf and Country Club. He died in Melbourne, Florida, on June 18, 1936. He was buried in Daytona Beach, Florida."

He became a deacon in the Congregational church of his native town in 1841, and was through life earnestly interested in that church's welfare. In 1846, and again in 1847, and in 1851, he was chosen to the State Senate, and thus became ex officio in the two latter terms a member of the Corporation of Yale College. In 1848 he represented Wilton, Connecticut in the House, and in 1852 was appointed bank commissioner. He had already been for many years one of the directors of the Fairfield County Bank. He died at his ancestral home in Wilton, Conn., December 1, 1883, in his 81st year, after a protracted illness. In November, 1836, he married Clarina, third daughter of the Rev.

A Republican, he represented District 42. Born in Hinesburg, Vermont, McEwen lived in New York and Wisconsin before settling with his family in Minnesota in 1857. The family lived first in Hutchinson, where they owned a cheese factory and Charles McEwen held local office in McLeod County, and later in Boon Lake, where they set up the first cheese factory in Renville County. An abolitionist and a member of the Home Guard, McEwen was elected to the House of Representatives in 1892. Following his death, his son Bowman maintained the family farm, and served on the Renville County Commission. In 1906, Bowman's daughter Sarah moved with her husband Max Ramsland to Canora, Saskatchewan. Max was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in 1917, but died after less than a year in office during the 1918 flu pandemic; Sarah was then elected to the legislature as his successor, becoming the first woman ever to serve in Saskatchewan's provincial legislature."

A few years earlier, while attending Southern Oregon College, he had been co-leader of a student group pushing to place on the ballot a measure asking Oregon voters to make that change. Klein was reelected in November 1978 to a second two-year term. In January 1979, he was elected House majority whip by his fellow legislators.

  "text" : "Charles Mackay (29 June 1875 – 3 May 1929) was a New Zealand lawyer, local politician, and Mayor of Wanganui between 1906 and 1920. Born Charles Ewing Mackay (later known as Charles Evan Mackay) in Nelson in 1875, Mackay achieved a BA and LLB in law. He started a law firm in Wanganui in 1902. Gaining election to the Wanganui Borough Council in November 1905, he successfully contested the mayoralty in 1906. Mackay stood as an independent in the Wanganui electorate in the 1908 election, but was defeated by James Thomas Hogan and George Hutchison in the first ballot. He was famously blackmailed by writer Walter D'Arcy Cresswell and in 1920, Mackay was convicted of Cresswell's attempted murder. Mackay served time in Mount Eden prison and was released in 1926. Upon his release, he moved to England and from 1928, worked in Berlin as a language teacher and part-time correspondent. In his latter function, he covered communist street riots raging after may day 1929 and was mistakenly shot dead by a policeman."
