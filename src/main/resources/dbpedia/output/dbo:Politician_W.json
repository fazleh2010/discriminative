He relocated to Auckland in 1841, where he became a member of the New Zealand Parliament. Biography Porter was born in London in 1784. He married Alice Roper in Liverpool (c. 1811), with whom he had four children. Porter became a prominent sea captain, operating a small fleet out of his own yard at Liverpool. He and other members of the Porter family sailed for the British East India Company (e.g. his cousin, George Porter). In the late 1830s he suffered substantial losses at sea, which his son said were behind his decision to migrate. Porter sold his shipyard in Liverpool and took two of his ships, Porter, and Dorset, provisioned with livestock and a range of personnel (including a doctor, tutors and servants), so that he could set up a relatively self-sufficient farming station at Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula. Porter himself captained his namesake, the Porter (a 252-ton brig), which he had built in 1824 and which had been strengthened so that it would be fit for the hazardous voyage. Upon arrival, he used this vessel to set up a shipping service from Port Lincoln and Adelaide to and from other Australian and New Zealand ports. Porter also built the Dorset (95 tons) in 1838, specifically as a back-up ship for the journey to Australia. This was sold upon arrival. Porter’s expedition arrived at Port Lincoln in early 1839. The party was just one of three to arrive with settlers for the district in the 1830s and 1840s. It became apparent to him that Adelaide would be the main settlement in South Australia and that immediate prospects for Port Lincoln would be limited. Impatient for success, he decided to forego the significant investment and effort he had made in the fledgling settlement (e.g. building two houses, establishing a bank and helping build the first Church of England). He abandoned the settlement in 1840. Although Porter’s tenure in Port Lincoln only lasted 18 months, he had, nevertheless, been appointed the first Magistrate of the Eyre Peninsular and his family left its name at ‘Porter Bay’. In May 1841, Porter arrived in New Zealand. Alice was sceptical and had returned to Liverpool with their son, William Field junior. She waited until he was properly settled, before joining him in Auckland. Porter served in the 1st New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Suburbs of Auckland electorate from 1853 to 1855, when he retired, but did not serve in any further Parliaments. He also served on the Auckland Provincial Council. Porter died on 30 March 1869 at Mangatangi, Waikato."

  "text" : "William McCombie (1805 – 1 February 1880), was a Scottish cattle breeder and agriculturist; he was also known as \"the grazier king\" or the \"king of graziers\". Born at Home Farm, Tillyfour, Aberdeenshire, the home of his father, Charles McCombie, a farming cattle dealer with Highland roots. After receiving his education at a local school, he attended Marischal College in Aberdeen but despite his father's reservations, he sought to follow him in an agricultural career. Initially, McCombie's employment was within the extensive family farming business, part of which was transporting cattle to the borders of Scotland and into England for fattening. During the 1820s he rented the arable 1,200-acre (4.9 km2) Tillyfour Farm from his father and began the process of building up his own herd of black polled cattle. The herd already on the farm when he leased it were quality animals and influenced by Lord Panmure, McCombie blended two types of polled cattle from the Aberdeen and Angus varieties to form the basis of the black Aberdeen Angus cattle. McCombie referred to the date he founded his herd as 1832, which was the year his cattle gained a first prize in exhibitions. Over five hundred prizes were won by his cattle throughout the UK and at major exhibitions in France. In 1867 his book Cattle and Cattlebreeders was published; three further editions were later printed. A campaigner for the rights of farmers and their workers, he became the first tenant farmer elected to a Scottish constituency in 1868 when he represented the Liberal Party as the western division of Aberdeen Member of Parliament. He was returned with a majority in 1874 but two years later, in 1876, ill health caused him to resign his seat. He never married and died a bachelor at Tillyfour on 1 February 1880. The cattle herd was sold at a disposal sale in August 1880."

  "text" : "Wesley Fletcher Orr (March 3, 1831 – February 16, 1898) was a Canadian businessman, journalist, and politician. He was the eighth mayor of the city of Calgary, Alberta. Orr was born in Lachute, Quebec on March 3, 1831 to Samuel G. P. Orr and Jane Hicks. He married Priscilla Victoria Miller circa 1863. Together they had two daughters and one son. Prior to moving to Calgary, Orr spent his life in various occupations. These include: cattle-dealer, salesman, teacher, and coroner. He also contributed to newspapers such as the Northern Gazette (Barrie, Ontario) and the Hamilton Spectator. In 1883, Orr was advised by D'Alton McCarthy to buy land at Fort Calgary prior to the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway. That year he purchased land south of the Bow River and east of the Elbow River with an associate, Mary S. Schreiber, for $10,000. This was nearly his entire fortune, as he was confident in getting a significant return. Due to complications, Orr settled in Calgary in 1886 to protect his investment. The railway station was not located near his property as expected and his involvement with local politics was to promote development near or on his property. Although his wife refused to follow, he took along his seven-year-old son. As with his time in the east, Orr spent time in various work opportunities. He thought the road to prosperity came through the railway and was involved in the Canadian Pacific Railway, Alberta Southern Railway Company, Rocky Mountain Railway, Coal Company, North-West Central Railway and a proposed line between Calgary and Hudson Bay. He was also involved in real estate, buffalo bone trading, operated a stone quarry, and was a financial agent. In 1888, he served as the editor of the Calgary Herald. Orr was also active in municipal politics. Excluding one year, he served as alderman from 1888 through 1894. He chaired the committee of public works which was responsible for the creation of much of the early infrastructure in Calgary, including: electric light, the General Hospital, sewage, municipal financing and water. In 1894, he became Calgary's eighth mayor and served for two one-year terms. Calgary was elevated to a city during November of his first term. With this, Orr became the first mayor of the city of Calgary. After a narrow defeat in 1896, he again took on the post as mayor in 1897 for another one-year term. He personally drew the city crest with its motto \"Onward Calgary.\" Orr died on February 16, 1898 in the Calgary General Hospital. In 1961, a stained glass window in St. Stephen's Anglican Church was dedicated to his memory."

After the Liberal Democrats defeat in the 2010 local elections in Liverpool during which the Labour Party took control of the city council for the first time since 1998 and their leader, Joe Anderson, became leader of the city council, Warren Bradley became leader of the opposition. Born and brought up in the city of Liverpool, he is a supporter of the campaign to keep Everton FC, of which he is a fan, within the city of Liverpool. Bradley was the subject of a mock-up by the Liverpool Echo following Liverpool's one star rating. The front page featured a mock up of Bradley as a cowboy in \"The Lone Star State\". On Monday April 18, 2011, Bradley announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Democrat group of Liverpool City Council following allegations of electoral fraud regarding the selection and nomination of his son as a candidate in the 2011 local elections.Bradley has been extremely critical of the centre-right leadership of the Liberal Democrats and attacked the coalition on several policies, even calling for the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition to end. According to a Lib Dem spokesperson he has been \"permanently excluded\" from the party after breaking its rules by declaring that he would stand for re-election as an independent candidate. In March 2012 Bradley admitted committing perjury following a police investigation into the aforementioned electoral fraud allegations and was fined by Liverpool Magistrates' Court."

In 1827, Robards was elected to succeed the late John Haywood as Treasurer and faced the unhappy duty of presiding over an office clouded with much controversy while the shortages in the accounts of his predecessor were uncovered. Following a single term as Treasurer, at the end of which he declined to run for re-election, Robards served for many years as clerk of the North Carolina Supreme Court. He was a close personal friend of U.S. Senator Willie P. Mangum."

  "text" : "William Baxter (4 December 1911 – 20 April 1979) was a British Labour Party politician, building contractor and farmer. He was a conscientious objector in the Second World War. Having served as a councillor, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for West Stirlingshire from 1959 until he stood down at the October 1974 general election. He was asked to stand down by his Constituency Labour Party after the indecisive election of February 1974, when he appeared on television calling for an all-party government of national unity, and suggested that the Duke of Edinburgh could chair its meetings. In 1961, as a protest against bipartisan support for British nuclear weapons, he voted against the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, and British Army Estimates in the House of Commons, and was suspended from the Labour Party Whip from March 1961 until May 1963. Baxter received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1976"

Warbey re-entered Parliament at a 1953 by-election for the Nottinghamshire constituency of Broxtowe, following the death of sitting Labour MP Seymour Cocks. However, that constituency was abolished for the 1955 general election, when Warbey was returned for the new Ashfield constituency. He held that seat until his retirement at the 1966 election.

He was epileptic. Arriving in Quebec City in July 1862, Milton and Dr Walter Butler Cheadle traveled across the North American continent, wintering near Fort Carlton. After a challenging and at times humorous summer they reached Victoria, BC. Together with Butler Cheadle, he traveled up the Athabasca River and in 1863 they became the first \"tourists\" to travel through the Yellowhead Pass. They later co-authored \"The North-West Passage by Land\"  and \" Voyage de l'Atlantique au Pacifique, à travers le Canada\", which described their expedition in considerable detail. Following his adventure in Canada, Milton entered politics and became one of the youngest members of the House of Commons. He represented the West Riding of Yorkshire South between 1865 and 1872."

Born in Marehay, Ripley, Derbyshire, Paling was the son of George Paling, a coalminer, from Sutton in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. At the age of 14 he started work in the local colliery before winning a scholarship to the Central Labour College in London. At the college he studied economics, industrial history and sociology. He also began his association with Labour politics. He returned to the coalfields where he became a checkweighman. In 1928 he was elected to the West Riding County Council, holding the seat until his election to Parliament. Paling made his first attempt to enter Parliament at Burton upon Trent, where he stood unsuccessfully at the general elections of 1929 and 1931. Throughout the 1930s he was active in the miners' trade unions. At the 1945 general election Paling was elected to the House of Commons as member of parliament for Dewsbury. He was sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers and used his position in parliament to promote mine and industrial safety. His brother, Wilfred Paling, was also a Labour MP and held positions as Minister of Pensions and then Postmaster General in the labour Government of 1945–1951. Paling was re-elected at Dewsbury in 1950, 1951 and 1955. In 1957 he was making a visit to the British Army of the Rhine to examine the conditions of national servicemen when he was involved in an air accident. The resulting neck injury led to his retirement at the 1959 general election. Paling had a long retirement, dying in April 1992, aged 99."

During 1918 he worked in the flying boat section at Felixstowe air base and after the war became chief draughtsman for the British Aeroplane Company. From 1925 to 1937 he worked at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, from which he was dismissed for failing to take proper care of classified information. During the Second World War he was involved in the foundation of the Osterley Park Home Guard School and worked as a lecturer in the War Office Home Guard School in Dorking and later became a WEA tutor. He was elected MP for Dulwich in the 1945 general election, but lost the seat in the 1951 election. He later served as a member of the London County Council and as a councillor in Camberwell. In January 1948 Vernon gave a speech on China in the House of Commons denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government and endorsing Mao Zedong's Communists. Vernon claimed that \"the Chinese government are running one of the most ruthless and cruel police states in existence,\" and called for Britain to adopt \"a policy of friendship and trade with the liberated areas\" under Communist control. He married in 1907 and again after the death of his first wife, in 1918. His second wife died in 1972. They had two children. He died in Bristol at the age of 93."

He was the youngest child of the Liberal MP Duncan McLaren (1800–1886) and his third wife Priscilla Bright, a sister of the Radical MP John Bright. Two of his brothers, Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway and John also became Liberal Members of Parliament. Walter Mclaren was married in April 1883 to Eva Muller, who died on 16 August 1921. McLaren first stood for election to the House of Commons at the 1885 general election, when he stood as an \"independent liberal\" candidate for the Inverness district of Burghs, in Scotland. He had been nominated by the Free Church Constitutional Party, and polled strongly against the official Liberal Party candidate, taking 47.5% of the votes. At the 1886 general election he was elected in Crewe, where the sitting Liberal MP George Latham had not sought re-election. McLaren was re-elected in 1892, but lost his seat at the 1895 general election.He did not stand in 1900, when the seat was regained for the Liberals by James Tomkinson, but when Tomkinson died shortly after being re-elected at the January 1910 election, McLaren was the successful Liberal candidate in the resulting by-election. He held the seat until his own death in 1912, aged 59. Walter is buried with his parents in St Cuthberts Churchyard in Edinburgh. Although the monument, lying on the east wall of the first south section under Edinburgh Castle, is huge, Walter is relegated to a simple footnote at the base of the stone."

At the 1832 general election Bolling was elected Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Bolton. He held the seat until 1841. Bolling and his family were deeply involved in the social upheavals associated with factory legislation, child labour and working class enfranchisement. They were dilatory mill-owners rather than opposed to any legislation and their mills came under attack from mass disturbance in 1842. Bolling was re-elected MP for Bolton as a Conservative in 1847 and held the seat until his death in 1848. His obituary notes that he had suffered a severe stroke the week before his death, and had died at his residence of Darcy Lever."

T'Vault led a wagon train of 300 that arrived in Oregon in 1845, after traveling on the Meek Cutoff, a branch of the Oregon Trail. He settled in Oregon City, and was appointed Postmaster General by the Provisional Government of Oregon. T'Vault became president of the Oregon Printing Association, which was an outgrowth of the Oregon Lyceum, and published the first issue of the Oregon Spectator on February 5, 1846. He was fired from the Spectator after 13 issues. T'Vault claimed it was because of differences with other association members, especially George Abernethy, though the association claimed it because of T'Vault's poor spelling. T'Vault was a pro-slavery Democrat who became a member of the Provisional Legislature of Oregon in 1846. The same year he was part of a group that urged the United States Congress to disallow the land claims of earlier White residents of the region, including that of John McLoughlin at Willamette Falls. The petition was partially successful and McLoughlin's claim was not recognized. In 1851, T'Vault led an exploring party of ten people from Port Orford in order to seek an overland route to the interior of the region. The party was ambushed by Native Americans and five members were killed, but T'Vault survived. He moved to southern Oregon and established the Table Rock Sentinel newspaper in 1855, and later the Oregon Sentinel in 1858. T'Vault represented Jackson County in the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1858, its final year, and served as speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives during its first session, in 1858-59. He advocated for the formation of an independent Pacific Republic and also practiced law in Jacksonville."

Premier Danny Williams dismissed Verge's comments, saying that \"he didn't understand that that's what it meant\", and that, \"for what it's worth, he's entitled to his opinion.\" Verge was later booed at a rally against the cuts after he reversed himself and sided with the government, although he stated he also supported the people of his district.On October 7, Premier Williams appointed a new Minister of Health and Community Services.Joined by the new minister in Lewisporte on October 14, Verge stated, \"Government is looking harder and digging deeper to try and find a solution to the problem. ...Hopefully at the end of the day we will be able to deliver all the services that the people want coming out of Lewisporte.\"The government subsequently reversed its decision to remove laboratory and X-ray services from Lewisporte, as Verge reported in his year-end interview, saying, \"It was an issue that caused me to have a greater appreciation for the people throughout our district and to also have a greater respect for our government - a government that proved it was willing to listen to the people and if necessary, to change its mind.\""

He served in the Florida House of Representatives from Brevard County from 1885 to 1887. He was born to John and Eliza (McCall) Brack in Georgia on June 17, 1837. He married firstly to the former Olive Chancey (1838–1864) of Clinch County, Georgia, by whom he had two sons who died young. The Bracks removed to Alexandria, Louisiana before the outbreak of the American Civil War. During that conflict, the future mayor served in Company C of the 27th Louisiana Infantry Regiment. After the war, the widowed Brack came to Florida, where he married his second wife Amy (July 5, 1847 - May 25, 1880). They had three daughters before her untimely death: Olive, Bessie, and Josphine Brack. It is unclear exactly when Brack settled in the Orlando area. He was certainly there by October 16, 1873, when he was mentioned as guardian ad litem for the orphans of Mrs. Lucinda Hughey Terrell in a lawsuit filed in the circuit court of Orange County, Florida. In 1875, when Orlando was formally incorporated, Brack was elected its first mayor. He was subsequently re-elected to a second one-year term. After leaving office, the former mayor remained in the Orlando area as a farmer and fruit grower until at least 1880. He was married there to his third wife Eliza Alpha Tyson on March 6, 1881. They had eight children: John Percy (\"Jack\"), Rosa Banner, Gussie, Emma Hortense, Ruby B, Blanche Alice, and Lillian Bell Brack, William Jackson, Jr The Bracks left Orlando to live on the north shore of Lake Tohopekaliga in what is now Osceola County, Florida, where they operated a general store and sawmill at \"Brack's Landing.\" From that point, he also captained a 35-foot sidewheel steamboat called \"Spray\" along the inland canals that connected the Kissimmee River valley to Fort Myers, Florida on the Gulf of Mexico. The former mayor retired to a cattle ranch near Narcoossee, Florida, where he died April 30, 1901. He is buried at Mount Peace Cemetery in Saint Cloud, Florida."

  "text" : "William O'Halloran was a pioneer of trade unionism in Galway in the west of Ireland, and was also Galway city's first Labour councillor. Born in the Bushy Park area around 1870, O'Halloran lived alone in Little/Leetle St (now called Newcastle Road from Cooke's Corner to the Presentation Road turn) at the time of the 1911 census. By his own account, he was one of a number of dock labourers who met one evening in August 1911 at Cromwell's Fort, near Renmore, to discuss the establishment of a union to represent general workers. Over the following days, news of the al fresco discussion spread around Galway, and a considerable crowd attended a subsequent public meeting at the Racquet Court Theatre. At that meeting, the Galway Workers' and General Labourers' Union (GWGLU) was established and O'Halloran was elected as its first secretary. About a thousand members were recruited -all eager to improve their working conditions. There was opposition, however from a Galway Employers' Federation chaired by the city's leading employer Máirtín Mór McDonagh. Negotiations between the GWGLU and the Federation broke down, and 23 employers locked out their 500 workers in March 1912. Arbitration brought a settlement acceptable to the locked-out workers in less than a week, and a 'victory' was celebrated in a 2 am march through the streets of the city. Subsequently, the GWGLU affiliated with the Liverpool-based National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL), a move which was unusual in Irish trade unionism at a time when the Irish Transport and General Workers Union was displacing the NUDL in Ireland. O'Halloran remained as branch secretary, and he would lead his members into a general strike in late March 1913 which shut down the city for five weeks. A negotiated settlement ensued. An interview with William O'Halloran, published on the eve of the strike, provides insights into the points at issue. In January 1914, William O'Halloran was elected a member of the Galway Urban Council, having been nominated by the Galway Trades & Labour Council. A Labour colleague, Martin Holleran, also took a seat. Having energetically raised labour matters and actively opposed recruitment into the British army early in World War One, O'Halloran sank into obscurity after 1915."

  "text" : "Wilson Frost (born December 27, 1925) is a former Chicago alderman of the 34th Ward. In 1976, upon the death of longtime mayor Richard J. Daley, Frost declared that he was now acting mayor, based upon his interpretation of the city charter and the fact that he was serving as President Pro Tempore of the City Council. However, Wilson found himself literally locked out of the mayor's office—he was told that the keys could not be found. In a power struggle that lasted several days, the entirely Democratic city council determined that Frost was incorrect in his claim, and appointed Alderman Michael Bilandic as acting mayor instead. Had he been elected mayor, Wilson Frost would have been Chicago's first African American mayor."

During this time his home and business were attacked several times, and his wife survived a gunshot to the head in 1972. His time in office coincided with the suspension of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, and he was therefore the first Lord Mayor since John White in 1920 not to serve as an ex officio member of the Senate. In the 1973 elections to Belfast City Council Christie stood in the north-west Belfast 'E' division (equivalent to the current wards of Legoniel, Ballysillan, Ardoyne, Woodvale, Forthriver and Ballygomartin), which elected 6 councillors. He was the only UUP candidate to stand in E and gained 7,875 votes, which equated to 2.8 times the electoral quota. He retired in 1977, and the UUP vote dropped more than 3000 votes. Amongst two UUP councillors elected to replace him was future Lord Mayor Billy Bell."

In 1892 he was elected as Liberal member of parliament for Shipley, but lost the seat three years later to Fortescue Flannery, his Conservative opponent. Byles was a pacifist, and actively opposed the Second Boer War. In 1900 he stood on an anti-war ticket as Labour candidate at Leeds East, but was defeated. He returned to the Commons at the 1906 general election as Liberal MP for Salford North, and was knighted in 1911. Byles retained his seat until his death. Sir William Pollard Byles died in October 1917 at his home in Hampstead, London, aged 78."

  "text" : "Will Morin is a Canadian politician, currently the interim leader of the First Peoples National Party of Canada. Morin was born in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and is a member of the Michipicoten First Nation. He was a medical assistant in the Canadian Forces during the 1991 Gulf War. He later obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, as well as a Bachelor of Arts degree in Native Studies and a Master of Arts degree in Humanities from Laurentian University. He is now a teacher, artist and cultural consultant in Sudbury, and was seeking a PhD in human studies from Laurentian at the time of the 2008 election. Morin has served on the board of the Sudbury Arts Council, was a founder of the White Mountain Academy of the Arts, and is a strong advocate for local artists. In 2003, he proposed a community arts centre for downtown Sudbury. His own works have been displayed nationally. He first ran as the party's candidate in Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing in the 2006 election, and subsequently ran in Sudbury in the 2008 election and the 2011 election. In both 2006 and 2008, Morin was the party's most successful candidate in number of votes received; in 2011, he was the party's only candidate. Morin was the Eastern Regional Representative for Aboriginal Students with the Canadian Federation of Students while attending university, and became politically active as president of the Young Liberals Association at Cambrian College. He later joined the FPNP, and was nominated as the party's first candidate for public office on December 28, 2005. In 2008, he argued that he was campaigning on a platform of aboriginal values, and fighting for the inclusion of aboriginal people in the political process. During the 2008 election campaign, he was excluded from an all-candidates debate on CIGM, and all four of the major party candidates — Liberal Diane Marleau, Conservative Gerry Labelle, New Democrat Glenn Thibeault and Green Gordon Harris — chose to boycott the debate rather than participate without Morin present. Although he received few votes, he said after the election that he accomplished what he set out to achieve. In 2006, Morin took part in a protest in support of a road blockade by the members of the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation in Brant. He later took part in a protest against the Canadian Pacific Spirit Train during the 2008 election. The Spirit Train was intended to raise support for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver; many protesters argued that the games were taking place on stolen native land."

Harker died in 1905 and, in 1906, his daughter Gertrude had repaired the old Chapel of St Mary the Virgin, which had been deconsecrated and left as a ruin, and established the Harker Memorial in Pateley Bridge Cemetery. Other family members named on the monument include his son, Robert, who was killed in action in France in 1915, and a descendant, Frederick, who was killed in action at sea in 1940. The Harker memorial was in a neglected state in 2006, but it was discovered that there was a forgotten Harker Trust Fund which had been set up to maintain both the memorial and churchyard. Members of the National Federation of Cemetery Friends began to restore the monument."

He took up an apprenticeship to the pin and wire trade in Birmingham and subsequently set up his own business as a manufacturer of tacks and shoe rivets. In 1872 Cook was elected to Birmingham Town Council, and in 1875 became chairman of the Borough Health Committee. He was made an alderman in 1882, and served as Mayor of Birmingham in 1883/84. In 1885 he was selected as Liberal candidate for the newly created constituency of Birmingham East, and won the seat at general election of that year. He was only a member of the House of Commons for a brief period, however, as he was defeated by his Conservative opponent when another election was held in 1886. He was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for the Bordesley constituency of Birmingham at the 1895 general election. Cook was a justice of the peace for Warwickshire and the City of Birmingham, and made his home at Ashley House, Birchfield, Staffordshire, on the outskirts of the city. He was knighted in 1906.

He was re-elected at the 1895 election, but was defeated at the 1900 general election. This was on account of his active service in the Second Boer War. He did not seek election again until the 1924 general election, when he stood as a Constitutionalist candidate in the Burslem constituency, but narrowly lost the two-way contest to his Labour Party opponent Andrew MacLaren. Allen did not stand in 1929, but when he stood as National Liberal at the 1931 general election he won the seat from MacLaren, who regained the seat at the 1935 general election. Allen did not stand again. He lived at the Allen family home, Woodhead Hall, in Cheadle."

He regained the seat again at the 1935 general election, and represented Bradford Central for a further decade until he retired from politics at the 1945 general election."

He represented the Dunedin and Suburbs South electorate from 1863 to 1866, when the 3rd Parliament was dissolved. He then represented the City of Dunedin electorate in 1866 (resigned) and from 1867 to 1875. He then represented the Port Chalmers electorate (Port Chalmers was Dunedin’s port) from 1876 to 1878, when he resigned. He was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council on 30 April 1878, and served until he died. In 1893 Reynolds was at the centre of a drama that led to the passing of the Women's suffrage bill into law. Premier Seddon had expected to stop the bill in the upper house, but found that one more vote was needed. Thomas Kelly, a new Liberal Party councillor had left himself paired in favour of the measure, but Seddon obtained his consent by wire to change his vote. Seddon's manipulation so incensed two opposition councillors, Reynolds and Edward Cephas John Stevens that they changed sides and voted for the bill, allowing it to pass by 20 votes to 18 and so gave the vote to women. Reynolds married Rachel Pinkerton in 1856 and together raised nine children."

He was re-elected in 1865, easily defeating a rival Liberal candidate, and was returned unopposed in 1868. When he stood as a Home Rule League candidate in 1874, he faced opposition again, also from his own party. His opponent, The O'Gorman Mahon was a long-serving MP who had represented Ennis as for the Repeal Association from 1847 to 1852, but Stacpoole held the seat by 115 votes to 99.

Frank Coles; fifteen months later Mr. Patterson sold out and engaged in leasing land in Carter County, Kentucky, at which he continued about a year, and then joined the firm of Damarine & Co., of Portsmouth, Ohio. In 1881, Patterson was nominated by the Republicans as a candidate for the Kentucky Legislature. Later, he was appointed Postoffice Inspector by Postmaster General Gresham, and served until the advent of the Cleveland administration. In June 1886, Patterson was elected mayor of Ashland, Kentucky."

  "text" : "William Thorne Buckland (1819 – 17 January 1876) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament in New Zealand. Buckland was born in 1819 or 1820. His mother was Elizabeth (née Mortimore) and his father was the broker John Buckland; they were from Devon, England. The auctioneer Alfred Buckland was a younger brother. Buckland arrived in New Zealand in 1841 from South Australia, and was a butcher in Auckland, then a farmer in the Waikato. He married Susan Channing on 13 April 1843 at St Paul's Church in Auckland. Buckland was appointed to the Auckland Executive Council of the Auckland Province in November 1856 (the source does not state and end date), and was again appointed from February to July 1857. He was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council for the Raglan electorate in November 1861 and served until 1869. From 1869 to 1873, he represented the Franklin electorate. He had no intention of standing for the Provincial Council again but happened to ride past the nomination meeting in Newmarket for the Eden electorate. There was only one nomination thus far for the two available positions, and Buckland was talked into being nominated. As the number of nominations matched the number of available positions, he was declared elected unopposed, and served until his death. He represented two South Auckland electorates; first the Raglan electorate from 1865 to 1866, when he retired. He then represented the Franklin electorate from 1871 to 1875. He was nominated for the 1876 election and gave a speech at the nomination meeting on 10 January 1876, but withdrew his nomination before the end of the proceedings. The Auckland Star suggested that the sole purpose of his nomination was that he could make a speech in opposition to Sir George Grey. Buckland left for the Waikato immediately afterwards to support Alfred Cox in his candidacy in the Waipa electorate. However, he became ill with symptoms of heat stroke and returned to his home in Remuera. He died at his home in Remuera, Auckland aged 56 years after that brief illness. He was buried at St Stephen's Cemetery in Parnell. His wife had died in September 1871; she had committed suicide after having become depressed. Their sons Frank and John Channing Buckland were both elected to the parliament in the 1884 election. Jessie Buckland was his son John's daughter."

  "text" : "William Bruce Harvey (June 2, 1907 – March 1, 1954) was a Canadian politician, who represented the electoral district of Nipissing in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1948 to 1954. He was a member of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party. He was born to Isabella Gibson (1878–1948) and Robert Harvie (1874–1929) in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, Scotland on June 2, 1907. In 1912, Robert and his oldest child Mary, sailed for Canada and settled in the Ottawa area. In June 1913, Isabella and William, along with three other siblings (Katie, Isabella and Jessie) sailed to Canada on the Teutonic and joined Robert and Mary in Ottawa. The purser of the Teutonic spelled the surname incorrectly and the family retained the new spelling of Harvey since all immigration documents used the ship’s registry information. Wiliam Harvey spent his teenage years in Ottawa. He moved to North Bay in 1923 to open a Keyes Supply Company office. His younger brother Bruce Harvey remained in Ottawa and was an alderman from 1961–1969, representing Elmdale-Victoria Ward, and working with Charlotte Whitton from 1960-64. Harvey met and married Eva Belle Moore (1907–1970) on June 3, 1929. They had three children: Edith Joan (1932–1996), Robert Walter (born 1934) and Isabel Diane (1937–1992). He was a commercial traveller and active member of the Canadian Travellers Association (CTA) and the Masonic Shrine Temple, North Bay Lodge #617. In 1940 he went into business for himself, and partnered with Don Seal to open Harvey Seal Motors (Mercury dealership) in 1942 located at Main Street West. Harvey was elected councillor for West Ferris Township, Ontario and served for 4 years before he entered the provincial political arena. He was elected as a Progressive Conservative MPP on June 7, 1948 and served the majority of his office in the government of Leslie Frost. He was appointed Vice Chairman of the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission in 1949 as well as Industrial Commissioner for Northern Ontario. The city of North Bay named Harvey Street and Harvey Street School in his honour. Harvey was re-elected to the provincial legislature in 1951 and served until his death on March 1, 1954."

He first stood for Parliament at the 1918 general election, when he was unsuccessful in Guildford, a safe seat for the Conservative Party. He contested Guilford again in 1922 and 1923, and did not stand again until the Battersea South by-election in February 1929. The vacancy had arisen when the Conservative MP Francis Curzon succeeded to the peerage as Earl Howe, and in a three-way contest Bennett took the seat for Labour with a majority of 2.1% of the votes. He was re-elected at the general election in May 1929 with a majority of only 1.1%, but at the 1931 general election he was soundly defeated by the Conservative Harry Selley, whose majority was 36.2%. After his defeat, Bennett stood unsuccessfully at the June 1933 by-election in Hitchin, at a November 1933 by-election in Harborough and in the 1935 general election in Cardiff East. Bennett was never returned to the House of Commons, but after Labour gained control of the London County Council from the Municipal Reform Party in 1934, he was appointed on 13 March as an alderman of the Council."

He was born in Newport, Monmouthshire, the son of a clergyman. In early life he was a solicitor in Queensland, Australia, having been articled at Ipswich and Maryborough. He then speculated in mining shares. He was a Liberal Member of Parliament for Merthyr Tydfil, from 1888 to 1900, when he was defeated, losing his seat to Keir Hardie. The constituency had two members, the other being the Liberal David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda: there was antagonism between the two Liberals, however, and in 1900 Thomas backed Hardie. A major political issue between them was attitude to the Second Boer War, supported by Morgan who was on the Liberal imperialist wing of the party. He was in favour of Welsh disestablishment, making a lengthy parliamentary speech on a resolution in 1891."

  "text" : "William Hirst (1873 – 5 May 1946) was a British Labour Co-operative politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bradford South from 1924 to 1931. Hirst first stood for election to Parliament at the \"coupon election\" in 1918, when he was an unsuccessful Co-Operative Party in Bradford South. He stood again in 1992 and 1923, as a Labour Co-operative candidate with the endorsement of the Labour Party, losing in both elections by a narrow margin of less than 3% of the votes. He won the seat on his fourth attempt, at the 1924 general election, defeating the sitting Liberal MP Herbert Harvey Spencer. Hirst was re-elected in 1929 with an increased majority. However, at the 1931 general election, the Labour Party had split over Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's decision to form a National government with the support of both the Conservative Liberal parties, and Hirst was opposed in Bradford only by a Liberal candidate, the Conservatives having stepped aside. He lost his seat by a huge margin of 32.6% of the votes. Hirts's seventh and final candidacy was at the 1935 general election, when he was defeated again, although he halved the Liberal majority to 16.8%."

He held the seat only until Parliament was dissolved later that year for the 1885 general election, when the two-seat Antrim constituency was divided into four single-member divisions. Sinclair stood in North Antrim, where in a three-way contest he was defeated by the Conservative Edward MacNaghten. When the Liberal Party split in 1886 over Irish Home Rule, Sinclair joined with the breakaway Liberal Unionist Party, and was elected at the 1886 general election as MP for Falkirk Burghs in Scotland, with a majority of only 19 votes (0.4% of the total) over the Liberal Party candidate.

After his retirement he eventually moved to Saltcoats, where he died in 1918 at the age of 89."

In the event he was opposed by the Reverend Patrick Figgis running as a \"Christian Socialist\". The poll took place on 13 August, with a turnout of less than 10% of the electorate and Guy secured 3,375 votes to 541 for Figgis. Guy retained the seat at the 1945 general election, but retired from the Commons at the 1950 election, when the Poplar South constituency was abolished. He became a member of Poplar Borough Council, and was mayor of Poplar in 1953. He was a director of the Amalgamated Tobacco Corporation. He died in Poplar in August 1968."

In 1844-1846, Knowlton served, in the Wisconsin Territorial Council, of the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature. In 1850, he was elected a Wisconsin Circuit Court judge and also served as a justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, until 1853, when a separate supreme court was formed.

He holds the title of Florida's longest-serving state legislator. He earned the nickname \"Banty Rooster\" – after the diminutive, swaggering barnyard fowl – and became known for his eccentric mannerisms and colorful, folksy expressions. Childers was popular in his district for the ample state funding and \"turkey\" projects he sent home, including $12.5 million for the Pensacola Civic Center and the I-110 extension to Gregory Street. Initially a Democrat, he switched to the Republican Party in 1995. After term limits forced him from the Florida Senate in 2000, Childers ran for the District 1 seat of the Escambia County Commission. He became embroiled in the soccer complex corruption scandal and was found guilty of violating the Florida Sunshine Law and of bribing Commissioner Willie Junior to help push the purchases of two properties, totaling $6.2 million, from Childers' associates Joe and Georgann Elliott. Childers served nearly three years of a 42-month prison sentence in West Palm Beach and was released on 17 June 2009, after which he relocated away from Pensacola. On 8 June 2010, a federal appeals court overturned the bribery conviction, ruling that Childers' constitutional right to confront his accuser had been violated, as the defense team was not allowed to question Junior on his change of testimony."

He was born in Castlebar, County Mayo, the son of John Bole and Elizabeth Jane Argyle, and was educated in Dublin. In 1877, he arrived at San Francisco, en route to Queensland. Having missed his ship, Bole changed his plans and travelled to Victoria. He was called to the British Columbia bar the following year. Still planning to continue on to Australia eventually, Bole set up practice in New Westminster. In 1881, he married Florence Blanchard Coulthard. In 1884, Bole was named police magistrate for New Westminster. In the same year, he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial assembly in a by-election. In 1887, he was named Queen's Counsel and, in 1889, County Court judge. In 1891, he became a local judge in the Supreme Court. Bole also served as a captain in the militia and as president of the Board of Trade. He was reportedly an excellent marksman. He died in New Westminster at the age of 76. Bole named the village of Belcarra, whose Gaelic name means \"the fair land upon which the sun shines\", after a village in Ireland."

  "text" : "William Dyer (also Dyre) (1609–by 1677) was an early settler of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, a founding settler of both Portsmouth and Newport, and Rhode Island's first Attorney General. He is best known for being the husband of the Quaker martyr, Mary Dyer, who was executed for her Quaker activism. Sailing from England as a young man with his wife, Dyer first settled in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but like many members of the Boston church became a supporter of the dissident ministers John Wheelwright and Anne Hutchinson during the Antinomian Controversy, and signed a petition in support of Wheelwright. For doing this, he was disenfranchised and disarmed, and with many other supporters of Hutchinson, he signed the Portsmouth Compact, and settled on Aquidneck Island in the Narragansett Bay. Within a year of arriving there, he and others followed William Coddington to the south end of the island where they established the town of Newport. Once in Newport, Dyer was very active in civil affairs, holding a number of offices, particularly those using his clerical skills such as clerk and secretary. The political alignment of the island towns of Portsmouth and Newport was in flux for the first decade of government there, and Coddington had gone to England to obtain a commission to keep the island independent with him as governor. By 1651 Dyer and others had greatly tired of Coddington's rule, and he was one of three men who went to England to have Coddington's commission revoked. Being successful, Dyer returned with the news in 1653, but his wife, Mary, who had been there at the same time, remained in England. Mary returned from England in 1657 after being there for five years, and had become a zealous Quaker convert. Banned from Massachusetts, she nevertheless defied the authorities and returned in 1659, being sentenced to hang, but getting a stay of execution while on the gallows. Her last trip to Boston in 1660 resulted in her execution and martyrdom. Following Mary's death, Dyer remarried, and continued his public service, while having some legal entanglements with William Coddington. He was dead by late 1677, though no record for his death has been found."

In 1900, Davidson married Bridget Walsh. He was nominated as a candidate by the Slocan Labour Party, which was based on the 1902 Provincial Progressive Party and also supported by the Socialists. In the provincial assembly, Davidson aligned himself with the Socialist members Parker Williams and James Hurst Hawthornthwaite. Because Premier Richard McBride only held a slim majority in the assembly, he often required support from the Socialists, which meant that they were able to push for progressive legislation, such as the eight-hour work day for miners, in the province. Davidson was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1907."

Shelly became vice-president and general manager of the new company. He was also president of the Home Oil Co. Ltd., Canada Grain Export Co. Ltd., Guaranty Savings and Loan, Crescent Beach Development Co. Ltd., Grouse Mountain Highway and Scenic Resort Ltd. and the Shelly Building. Shelly served as finance minister in the provincial cabinet. In the fiscal year 1929/1930, the province suffered a fairly small deficit of $135,000. Shelly projected an increase of government revenues and a small surplus for the following fiscal year; instead, revenues decreased and expenditures were larger than projected, resulting in a then-record deficit of $4.8 million. Shelly was transferred to the position of president of the Executive Council in October 1930. He also suffered a large personal financial loss when share prices for Home Oil Co. Ltd. bottomed out in the years following the stock market crash. He retired from politics in 1933. Shelly died in Vancouver at the age of 72."

In 1868 he was returned to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the electoral district of Collingwood as a supporter of the Darling Grant, defeating no less a candidate than the Hon. James Service. He was Minister of Public Works in the M'Culloch Government from April 1870 to June 1871, but did not re-enter Parliament after 1874, though he contested for the districts of Fitzroy (1877) and Collingwood again (1880). Mr. Bates was a prominent member of the Congregationalist body, and was Treasurer of the Jubilee Fund which was raised a few years ago to celebrate the jubilee of the establishment of the first church of the denomination in Victoria. That movement was so successful that close upon £48,000 was raised, and the denomination was able to pay off the debts on all its churches in the colony. Mr. Bates died at Fitzroy, Melbourne, on 12 January 1891, at the age of sixty-five. He married Anne Cramer Williams in Melbourne in 1857, and there was issue of 2 sons and 5 daughters."

Of particular value to historians are the William Ancrum Papers, 1757–1789, which are made up of Ancrum's letters and personal account books, currently held by the South Caroliniana Library at the University of South Carolina. This collection provides insight into the economic impact of the American Revolution on Charleston planters and merchants, from the prices of slaves to restrictions on imports and exports."

Newbury, was a businessman and lawyer in the U.S. Midwest and in Oregon, who served as the mayor of Portland, Oregon, from 1877 to 1879. He was elected mayor on June 18, 1877. Newbury was born in Ripley, New York, on September 19, 1834. He graduated from the Wisconsin Mercantile College, in Madison, Wisconsin, in the mid-1850s. After traveling around the U.S. South for several months, he lived for a time in St. Paul, Minnesota, and then in Sioux City, Iowa. In 1860, he married Alzina Taylor. During the American Civil War he served in the 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, rising to the rank of first lieutenant. He later served in the Army of the Cumberland, fighting for the Union in the Battle of Chickamauga and the battles of Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain. After the war, Newbury was appointed Assistant Provost Marshal of the State of Kansas. He passed the bar in Kansas in 1865 and practiced law there for a time. He served as the elected mayor of Iola, Kansas, but resigned in 1870 after deciding to move to the West Coast, where he settled in Portland, Oregon, in August of that year. In Oregon, he worked as a buyer and shipper in the wheat business. He co-founded the Newbury-Chapman Company with J. A. Chapman and J. C. Hawthorne, and was its manager. Located in Portland, the company sold implements and supplies for use in agriculture. In May 1876, he was nominated to be a candidate for the Oregon Legislature \"in his absence and without previous consultation with him\", The Morning Oregonian newspaper reported. He declined to run, saying that serving would take too much time away from his business activities. On June 18, 1877, Newbury was elected mayor of Portland. He served a two-year term, from July 1877 to July 1879, during which time he maintained a good relationship with the city council. William Newbury moved to Eastern Oregon in 1900. In the last \"few years\" of his life, he practiced law in Baker County, Oregon, but he returned to Portland about one year before his death, which occurred on November 19, 1915, at his home in Portland, about two weeks after he had suffered a stroke. He is buried at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland."

In May 1672 Walter Hoyte was among those whose names were given to the General Court \"for the beginning of a plantation neare the backside of Norwalke.\" He, along with Ralph Keeler, was contracted by the settlement to cut the timber and build a house for Reverend Thomas Hanford. He voted in the town meetings in Norwalk, and was confirmed by the General Court as one of the proprietors of Norwalk in 1685. Hoyt's Hill, named after Walter Hoyt, is the historical name of the hill in the Green at the northeast corner of East Avenue and Willow Street. The place name dates back at least as early as 1679. He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founding settlers of Norwalk in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery."

Born into a prominent Anglo-Indian merchant family in Calcutta, Harper was educated in India and England and joined the RAF in 1937. He served as an officer throughout the Second World War and saw action as one of \"The Few\" in the Battle of Britain, during which he was wounded in action. Appalled by Britain's granting of independence to India in 1947, he emigrated to Rhodesia on retiring from the air force two years later. Harper contended that British rule in the subcontinent should never have ended, and took a similar stance regarding his adopted homeland, reportedly declaring that it, South Africa and the neighbouring Portuguese territories would \"be under white rule forever\". He entered politics with the Dominion Party in 1958 and became Minister of Irrigation, Roads and Road Traffic in the Rhodesian Front (RF) government in 1962. The head of a far-right group within the RF, he called for Rhodesia to abolish black representation in parliament and adopt \"a form of political apartheid\". When the Prime Minister Winston Field resigned in 1964, Harper was a front-runner to succeed him, but lost out to Ian Smith, who moved him to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Each breakdown or setback during the early years of Smith's premiership prompted press speculation that Harper might replace him. In 1966, when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Harper led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to their rejection. Harper resigned from the Rhodesian Front in 1968, soon after Smith dismissed him from the Cabinet, reportedly because Harper had had an extramarital affair with a British agent. He subsequently became a vocal critic of the Prime Minister, greeting each step Smith made towards settlement with black nationalists during the Bush War with public indignation. By the time majority rule began in Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement of the previous year, Harper had left for South Africa. He died in 2006 at the age of 90."

He began his career as a grocer but believing the administration needed improvement he stood as a City of Hobart alderman in 1876, winning the election. He became Mayor of Hobart in 1879 and in 1881 he stood for parliament, being elected House of Assembly member for West Hobart. He became Treasurer of Tasmania from 1884 to March 1887 under Premier Adye Douglas and James Agnew.  Burgess, who was the recognised Leader of the Opposition to the Philip Fysh Ministry, was a captain unattached in the Tasmanian Defence Force. He was one of the Tasmanian delegates to the Federation Convention held at Sydney in 1891. In August 1891, owing to the stoppage of the Bank of Van Diemen's Land, with the management of which he was identified, Burgess resigned his seat in the Executive Council and in Parliament and his position as Leader of the Opposition. In 1916 Burgess made a return to Tasmanian politics, winning election to the multi-member seat of Denison as a Liberal; however, he died the following year in Hobart."

Although it is a minority party that received fewer than 3,000 first preference votes in 2013, under the Australian Single Transferable Vote system it was predicted for a length of time that the party would receive the required 123,304 total votes to fulfil a Senate quota in Western Australia. Dropulich did not win a seat in the initial count but was elected to the Senate in a recount. With the prospect of the Motoring Enthusiast and Sports parties each winning a senate seat despite getting to the 14.3 percent quota with preference flows from record-low primary votes of 0.5 percent in Victoria and 0.2 percent in Western Australia respectively, various parties and MPs including the incoming government sought Senate reform. This was achieved by the Coalition government with support from Labor and The Greens before the 2016 election. The Sports Party has been involved in Glenn Druery's Minor Party Alliance."

He was an independent member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1938 to 1956, representing the electorate of Chaffey . MacGillivray was born at Inverness in Scotland, the son of a blacksmith. He fought with the Royal Horse Artillery in Egypt and Palestine during World War I, but suffered badly from malaria when he returned home. He migrated to South Australia in 1922, taking advantage of a free passage offered to returned soldiers and hoping that the climate would improve his health. He thereafter became a fruitgrower at Barmera. He also served as chairman of the District Council of Cobdogla. MacGillivray was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1938 election, at which independent candidates won 14 of 39 seats and 40 percent of the primary vote, more than either of the major parties. MacGillivray was eventually defeated by Liberal and Country League candidate Harold King at the 1956 election after the LCL and the Labor Party exchanged preferences in order to dislodge him, a decision that saw an \"intense struggle\" within the LCL at the time. He had been seen as a \"bitter critic\" of the policies of the Playford LCL government."

  "text" : "Tan Sri Haji Wan Mokhtar Ahmad was the Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) of the Malaysian state of Terengganu from 1974 to 1999. He held the seat of Cukai in the Terengganu State Legislative Assembly for the same period, as a member of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in the Barisan Nasional coalition. He is Terengganu's longest-serving chief minister. Wan Mokhtar was an ally of the similarly long-serving Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. In 1987 he was elected a national vice-president of UMNO, alongside Anwar Ibrahim, on Mahathir's ticket. His tenure as Chief Minister and a state assemblyman came to an end at the 1999 election, when the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party took control of both the state assembly and Wan Mokhtar's seat in a landslide victory. Wan Mokhtar's son, Wan Abdul Hakim, was elected to the Terengganu state assembly in 2008."
