  "text" : "Oberleutnant Stefan Herdt, also known as Heinz Herdt, was German Representative in Sark from 4 July 1940 to October 1942, and commander of the German garrison. Born in 1915 and trained as a teacher before being called up in 1939. Selected for officer training he served in Poland and Belgium before coming to the Channel Islands, as commander of Company 6 Infantry Regiment 583. He took office the day after the German occupation, deposing Sibyl Hathaway as the most senior authority in the island with the title Inselkommandant Sark. During his tenure, Operation Basalt took place, in which three prisoners were killed by British commandos, in one case because the prisoner began shouting to alert nearby German soldiers, and in the other cases the prisoners were killed while attempting to escape during an attack by German forces. Nazi propaganda obscured the details of the event and portrayed it as the execution of prisoners. Herdt was replaced as commander in Sark and reportedly Herdt was to face a court martial but for the reaction by Hitler to the deaths.The raid prompted Hitler to issue an order calling for all British commandos to be summarily executed. Herdt returned as commander in Sark after the death of Johann Hinkel in March 1943."

  "text" : "Steve Troxler is a tobacco farmer and the Republican Commissioner of Agriculture for the U.S. state of North Carolina, sworn in February 8, 2005 after an extended election dispute following the November 2004 statewide election. Troxler, a resident of Browns Summit, North Carolina, studied conservation at North Carolina State University, earning a bachelor's degree in 1974; he later founded a family tobacco and wheat farming operation. Troxler ran for the post of North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture in 2000, losing to Meg Scott Phipps; he ran again for the same position in the 2004 Council of State election, finishing only 2,000 votes ahead of incumbent Democrat Britt Cobb. However, because over 4,000 votes were lost in Carteret County, the race was unresolved for over three months. After extended legal battles between Cobb and Troxler, Cobb conceded the race on February 4, 2005. Troxler was sworn in as North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner on February 8, 2005, a month after the rest of the Council of State, becoming the first Republican Agriculture Commissioner in the state's history. After his inauguration at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds, Troxler rode a tractor to his downtown offices. Steve Troxler was elected in 2008 to serve another term as Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services for the state of North Carolina. In 2012 he was elected to a third term. There has been some controversy regarding his stance on legally carried firearms at the NC State Fair. Opponents like to point out that he promised police escorts for attendees to get to their cars safely, but none were provided."

  "text" : "Stephnie de Ruyter is the leader of the New Zealand Democratic Party, a small left-wing New Zealand political party based upon Social Credit economics. The Democrats are currently outside Parliament. While the Democratic Party was a member of the Alliance, de Ruyter served as an Alliance candidate. In the 1999 election, she was the Alliance's candidate for the Invercargill electorate, and was ranked twenty-second on the party's list. She was not elected. Later, when the Democrats joined Jim Anderton to establish the breakaway Progressive Coalition, de Ruyter took an active role in building the new party. By the time of the 2002 election, de Ruyter was deputy leader of the Democrats and was ranked fifth on the Progressive list. She also stood as the Progressive Coalition's candidate in Invercargill. Once again, she was not elected. Not long after the 2002 election, the Democrats opted to leave the Progressive Coalition and reestablish themselves as an independent party. The leader of the Democrats, Grant Gillon, along with the former leader John Wright, unsuccessfully urged the party to remain a member of the Progressive Coalition. De Ruyter was elected leader on Gillon standing down and John Wright also leaving. De Ruyter has also been involved in local-body politics in Invercargill, standing for election to the Southland health board."

  "text" : "Stuart (Stu) Milton Hodgson, OC (April 1, 1924 – December 18, 2015) was Commissioner of the Northwest Territories (NWT) from March 2, 1967 until April 6, 1979. The first Commissioner to actually reside in the Northwest Territories, he was a leader in the construction of a semiautonomous, responsible self-government run by residents of the territory. He was appointed as a Citizenship Judge in British Columbia in December 1997 and served until 2005 Hodgson was one of the founders of the Arctic Winter Games - which began in Yellowknife in 1970 for athletes from Alaska, Yukon, and the NWT – and which now also include Greenland, parts of Arctic Russia, as well as Northern Alberta and Nunavik (Northern Quebec), and the new territory Nunavut which was formed from NWT in 1999. He was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada on December 18, 1970for his service to labour and government. Subsequently he received the Queen's commemorative medals for her silver, golden, and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012);as well as the Canada 125 medal in 1992. When rapid changes in socio-economic conditions threatened the continuity of Inuit oral history, Commissioner Hodgson urged the taping of elders' stories. In 1974, the residents of Pangnirtung (since then becoming part of Nunavut) presented the Commissioner with eleven stories which were later compiled into a book. Hodgson was nicknamed \"Umingmak\" by the Inuit. For his services in the NWT, he was presented the public service's Outstanding Achievement Award in 1976. From 1942 to 1945 he served with the Royal Canadian Navy on convoy duty in the North Atlantic for which he received the 1939-1945 Star, Atlantic Star and other World War II medals. From 1979 to 1981 he was Canadian co-chairman of the U.S.-Canadian International Joint Commission. He was recruited by Premier William R. Bennett of British Columbia to run BC Ferries for a time in the 1980s. He was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of the BC Transit in 1985. Hodgson died on December 18, 2015."

He served as Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Comox Valley riding in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as a member of the BC Liberal Party.

A native of Quebec, Ramsay first travelled to the west with the Wolseley Expedition in a suppression effort to the Red River Rebellion in 1870. Before returning home, he visited the Calgary area and hunted buffalo. This was prior to the initial Fort Calgary settlement, which happened in 1875. In 1883, Ramsay returned to Calgary and established several businesses. In the 1885 North-West Rebellion, he was a Government dispatch rider. He served eight total years on the city council as an alderman and was also mayor from January 5, 1904 to January 2, 1905, during which time he was a stringent supporter of municipal ownership, working to establish a lighting and water system for the city. After his retirement in Calgary from his business, he moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where he died in 1942."

  "text" : "Sheelagh Mary Murnaghan (26 May 1924 — 14 September 1993) was an Ulster Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland at Stormont. Born into a Roman Catholic family in Dublin, the granddaughter of George Murnaghan, a Nationalist MP, she grew up in Omagh before studying law at Queen's University, Belfast, graduating in 1947. Whilst at Queen's she became the first female president of the Literary and Scientific Society (the Literific), the university debating society. She qualified as a barrister and played for the Irish national women's hockey team. Murnaghan joined the Ulster Liberal Association in 1959, and unsuccessfully contested South Belfast in the British general election that year. In 1961, she won a by-election for Queens University Belfast and became the only Liberal member ever to sit in the Northern Ireland House of Commons. While an MP, Murnaghan campaigned to abolish the death penalty and for a bill of human rights. When her seat was abolished, she failed to win North Down at the 1969 Northern Ireland general election, and was also unsuccessful in Belfast South at the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election. During the 1970s, she sat on various quangos, including the Industrial Relations Tribunal and the Equal Opportunities Commission. She continued to practice at the Bar, specialising in harassment cases. She died in 1993, aged 69, from undisclosed causes."

He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1940 and a medical degree in 1943 from the University of Toronto. He then served with the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps during World War II. After the war, he did postgraduate work in urology. He then moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, where he practiced until he retired in 1979. After retiring, he focused on politics. He was the chief fund raiser for the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan and helped form the government in Saskatchewan in 1979. In 1984, he was one of the first three appointments made Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to the Senate. He represented the Senatorial division of Regina-Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan and resigned shortly before his 75th birthday in 1993. He served as treasurer and deputy president of the Canadian Medical Association. He was a director of IPSCO, the Canadian steel company, from 1982 to 1989."

Bowles was born in Monroe, North Carolina  and served in the United States Military during World War II (1943–1945). In the early 1960s, Bowles served as Governor Terry Sanford's Secretary of Conservation and Development, a post which later became known as Secretary of Commerce. Afterwards, Bowles was elected to one term in the North Carolina House of Representatives and two terms in the North Carolina Senate. In 1972 Bowles won the Democratic primary for Governor of North Carolina but lost the general election to James Holshouser. Thus, he became the first Democratic nominee to lose the North Carolina gubernatorial race in the twentieth century. Bowles later became known for his service to and fundraising for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, from which he graduated in 1941. UNC's Center for Alcohol Studies is named for him. Bowles died in 1986 from complications of Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS). His son, Erskine Bowles, followed his father both into the investment banking business and into politics."

From 1863 to 1865, Campbell served on a commission to consolidate the statutes for Nova Scotia. On September 20, 1867, he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons as the first member to represent the riding of Guysborough. He was re-elected for a second term on October 12, 1872, but was defeated in an election on January 22, 1874. Having been opposed to Nova Scotia's entry into the Confederation of Canada in 1860s debates, he remained a member of the Anti-Confederation Party through his first year in office, which was in favour of reversing the decision to join the Confederation. In September 1868 he joined the Liberal-Conservative Party when the Anti-Confederation Party began to collapse, the first MP in Canadian history to cross the floor of Parliament. Spending his last years as a court county judge, he died on February 20, 1885."

He married Marianne Georgiana Dashwood on 11 February 1847, and with her had six children: Louisa Emma, Edmund (4th Baronet), Robert Lindsay, Cosmo (5th Baronet), and two other daughters. His land included the ancient monument Stonehenge, but during his lifetime he not only refused to let the government agency for the preservation of ancient monuments even look at the property. It was rumored that an anonymous buyer wanted to buy the stones and take them to the United States; if Antrobus had accepted the offer, no one could have stopped him. He was elected MP for East Surrey in 1841, serving until 1847. He was subsequently elected as Liberal MP for Wilton in 1855, serving until 1877. He was High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1880. He succeeded to the Baronetcy upon the death of his father on 4 May 1870. Upon his death, he was succeeded to the Baronetcy by his eldest son, Sir Edmund Antrobus, 4th Baronet."

Salahuddin Owaisi, also known as \"Salar-e-Millat\", repeatedly alleged in his speeches that the Indian state had \"abandoned\" the Muslims to their fate. Therefore, \"Muslims should stand on their own feet, rather than look to the State for help'’, he argued.Owaisi was considered to be the strongest person in Hyderabad politics as his power extended till the borders of Andhra Pradesh. Muslims in the State rallied behind him and he was considered to be the man who could tilt the Muslim vote bank in Andhra Pradesh to whichever Party he felt like supporting. He was considered to be the most prominent Muslim Leader in Hyderabad."

In the revote on March 2, Ningark defeated Mapsalak by a margin of 193 to 179. In the 2013 election, Mapsalak was re-elected to the legislature, defeating Johnny Ningeongan in the redistributed district of Aivilik.

He was an elected legislator in the Kashmir State Assembly for three consecutive terms. Mr Sadiq Ali was born in Srinagar into an influential business family. His father, the late Mr. Jaffer Ali was a Paper mache artist and businessman. Sadiq Ali graduated from Aligarh Muslim University and earned his MA in Political Science. He has given some important recommendations about the solution of the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. His self-rule report has been widely applauded in both India and Pakistan and his recommendations have been regarded as one of the most workable solutions of this issue. He has also written a comprehensive paper on the deteriorating conditions of the forests of Jammu and Kashmir State; he has further submitted an indepth research paper outlining how the Dal Lake may be saved from further degradation. Mr Sadiq Ali entered politics at a very young age, and was one of the closest associates of Sheikh Abdullah, the founder of National Conference. He was nominated to the State Legislative Council numerous times. He also held the position of treasurer of the JKNC for 23 years. He quit National Conference stating personal reasons, although he never spoke against the NC party or its principles. There was widespread speculation that the only reason Mr Sadiq Ali quit NC was because of the NC leadership's inadequate action against a rival from within NC, whom Mr Sadiq had accused of sabotaging his re-election bid from Zadibal. On March 9, 2008, Farooq Abdullah, the patron of NC, announced to the media that Mr Sadiq Ali had rejoined the party and would be handling the state affairs of the party."

  "text" : "Sir Henry Spencer Moreton Havelock-Allan, 2nd Baronet DL (30 January 1872 – 28 October 1953) was a Liberal Party politician in the United Kingdom. Havelock-Allan was born at Blackwell Grange, the eldest son of Sir Henry Havelock-Allan. In 1897, he inherited his father's baronetcy. On 7 April 1905, he was made a Deputy Lieutenant for Durham. At the January 1910 general election, he became Member of Parliament (MP) for Bishop Auckland, and was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Edwin Samuel Montagu, in the latter's role as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 1911–14 and Under-Secretary of State for India in 1913. Whilst still an MP, Havelock-Allan joined the 17th Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers and fought in France in the First World War, where he was wounded in 1916. He did not stand for Parliament again at the 1918 general election. Havelock-Allan married three times but had no children. One of his wives were Edith Mary Sowebry, daughter of Thomas Charles Johnson Sowerby and sister-in-law of Lady Mabel Annesley. On his death in 1953, his baronetcy passed to his nephew, Henry."

Following boundary changes in 1950, he was elected for the new Stepney constituency and served until his retirement in 1964. He served as Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1945 to 1951. A devout Roman Catholic, he was known as a campaigner against prostitution, which was a big problem in his constituency. He died on the day of the 1964 general election. Edwards was elected to Stepney Borough Council in 1934 and served on it until 1959. In 1944–1945, when he was already an MP, he served as mayor.

Woloshyn was reportedly a former card-carrying Progressive Conservative member, but told members of the NDP constituency that it was behind him. Before the next election, he crossed the floor to join the Progressive-|Conservative caucus for which he sat for 11 years. Born in Edmonton, Woloshyn received a bachelor of education degree from the University of Alberta, and went on to serve as teacher, department head and principal of Memorial Composite High School in Stony Plain. From 1977 to 1989, he served as principal of Kitaskinaw School on the Enoch Indian Reserve. Woloshyn crossed the floor to the governing Progressive Conservative caucus prior to the election in 1993. In 1996, Woloshyn was appointed Minister of Public Works, Supply and Services, and was re-elected (and re-appointed to cabinet) in 1997. Following the cabinet shuffle of May 1999, he was named Minister of Community Development. In the year 2000, Woloshyn received the Association of Professional Engineers and Geologists of Alberta (APEGGA) Summit Award. Woloshyn ran again in 2001, re-capturing the constituency of Stony Plain easily, with 67% of the vote. He did not run again in 2004. Rates at the province's long-term care facilities were increased by 42% under his watch, and Woloshyn himself was \"somewhat disappointed\" in the lack of assistance handed down to seniors in the spring 2004.  The NDP was critical of his and other retirning government members' \"transition allowances\", in Woloshyn's case totalling over $477,000."

  "text" : "Scott Kenneth Fraser is a Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia and a member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly from the riding of Alberni-Qualicum in the 2005 provincial election and re-elected in Alberni-Pacific Rim in the 2009 election, though his party formed the official opposition to a BC Liberal majority government both times. He served as the NDP critic for aboriginal issues in both parliaments and as the critic for community and rural development for a time during the 39th Parliament. He assigned to the Select Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs in both Parliaments but the committee was not convened. In the 38th Parliament of British Columbia, he introduced the Promotion of Safe Antifreeze Act, 2007 which sought to ban ethylene glycol from antifreeze products due to its toxic effects on animals. It only received first reading but was followed by the implementation of a regulation which required the addition of a foul-tasting agent to antifreeze. He sat on the Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture which studied economic and environmental effects of fish farms and delivered recommendations to the Legislative Assembly. In the 39th Parliament, he introduced the Cave Protection Act, 2010 which proposed to create a registry of all cave sites and create legal protection for them. He sat on the Special Committee on Cosmetic Pesticides which studied the potential for regulations for cosmetic pesticide use. During the 2011 NDP leadership election, Fraser endorsed John Horgan, though Adrian Dix went on to win and replace Carole James as leader of the BC NDP. Prior to becoming an MLA, Fraser served one term (1996–1999) as mayor of Tofino, British Columbia. Prior to being mayor he operated a bed and breakfast. After serving as mayor he worked as a manager at a shellfish farm. He had also stood for election during the 2004 federal election, as the New Democratic Party nominee in the Nanaimo—Alberni electoral district. However, he lost to the incumbent James Lunney of the Conservative Party."

  "text" : "Sydney Scholefield Allen QC (3 January 1898 – 26 March 1974) was a barrister and Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was married to Mona (née Irving) and they had two sons, John (advisor to Harold Wilson) and David. Born in Birkenhead to Joseph Allen and his wife Edith (née Scholefield), he was educated at Birkenhead Institute and Liverpool University, from where he graduated with first class honours in law. He served with the Royal Artillery during the First World War, and subsequently was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn. Practising in criminal law, his most famous brief was the sensational 1931 Liverpool murder case, acting as junior counsel for William Herbert Wallace, assisting Roland Oliver KC, who led for the Defence. Wallace was initially convicted of the bizarre murder of his wife Julia, and sentenced to death, but in a unique legal decision the verdict was quashed on Appeal, because the weight of the evidence did not support it, and Wallace was freed. Scholefield Allen was appointed a Kings Counsel in June 1945. He served as Recorder of Blackburn between 1947 and 1970. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Crewe at the 1945 general election, defeating the Conservative Home Secretary, Sir Donald Somervell, and held the seat until he retired at the February 1974 general election, a month before his death. His successor as MP was Gwyneth Dunwoody."

In 2002, Phillip drew media attention when he successfully forced a film project about the Aboriginal legend of the Ogopogo to be renamed Mee-Shee: The Water Giant. He did this by claiming that \"It's an international concern among indigenous people about the exploitation of spiritual entities... for commercial purposes.\" On November 26, 2014, Phillip told delegates at the B.C. Federation of Labour convention that he would get arrested as a matter of principle to protest Kinder Morgan’s plans to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline. The following day Phillip joined protesters at a Kinder Morgan borehole site on Burnaby Mountain, \"We are making a very clear public statement that we do not support the Harper and Clark governments when it comes to resources,\" he said before his arrest."

His career, aside from politics, consisted of speaking publicly to youth across Canada about his life and writing about his own experiences on such topics as drugs and violence. LeClerc graduated from the University of Waterloo with an honours degree in sociology with a minor in social work, and with a social work diploma. He was an associate member of all of the Crime Stoppers chapters in Saskatchewan, and the founder and past director of Teen Challenge Saskatchewan. LeClerc also spoke against the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, stating that it puts the rights of the individual (criminal) over the rights of society as a whole. He was elected to represent the electoral district of Saskatoon Northwest in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in the 2007 election, as a member of the Saskatchewan Party."

Born at Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, Sidney Dye was educated at Wells Elementary School and Ruskin College, Oxford. A farmer, he was elected to Norfolk County Council in 1934 and Swaffham Rural District Council in 1935. He contested South West Norfolk unsuccessfully in 1935, but in the 1945 election he snatched the seat by only 53 votes. In 1950, his majority increased to 260, but he was defeated in the 1951 election. In 1955, Dye regained the seat with a majority of 193, securing Labour's only gain of that election. The circumstances of his death were as follows. On Sunday, 7 December 1958, Dye joined protesters blockading the airbase, at Swaffham, in his constituency - the intended site of intermediate range nuclear missiles. On Monday, 8 December, he travelled to the House of Commons to table a question regarding the protests. On the morning of Tuesday, 9 December 1958 Sidney Dye was killed in a head-on collision with another vehicle near his home in Swaffham. On 18 December, an inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death, after hearing that the brakes on the MP's car, which was less than three years old, were \"completely ineffective.\""

  "text" : "Thiru S.D.Somasundaram,(Tamil: எஸ்.டி.சோமசுந்தரம்), popularly known as S.D.S is a veteran political leader and administrator who served as a Cabinet Minister in the State Government. Hailing from a hamlet of Sendankadu near Pattukottai town from an agricultural family, Thiru Somasundaram was an active social worker and was associated with various social organizations. Thiru S.D.S did his engineering (B.E mechanical ) from Annamalai University. He was a great athlete, a football player during his college days, and marathon race winner representing Tamil Nadu. After his graduation, S.D.S worked as an assistant engineer in public works department. Thiru S.D.S began his political career as an activist of the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1947 and joined the DMK when the late C.N. Annadurai floated the party in 1949. He was first elected to parliament from the Thanjavur Lok Sabha constituency in Tamil Nadu in 1967 after defeating former president R. Venkataraman. He was re-elected from the same constituency in 1971 in DMK ticket and 1977 as AIADMK ticket. In 1972, he was one of the first to leave the DMK along with M.G. Ramachandran (MGR) and was considered by the AIADMK middle and lower-level workers as a simple man who mixed with them easily and had a fairly clean record as a politician. MGR took the activities of SDS very much close to his heart. He resigned his MP post in 1977 and was nominated to the now-defunct legislative council. Mr. S.D.S was an able parliamentarian and served as a Member of the Joint Committee on Salaries and Allowances of Members of Parliament during 1971-72, Committee on Private Members’ Bills and Resolutions during 1973-74; House Committee in 1977 and General Purposes Committee during 1977-78. He was the first insider to question MGR about the widespread corruptions during his term as chief minister. As a result of differences that existed between him and MGR, he decided to quit AIADMK and floated his own party \"Namathu Kazhagam\" meaning \"Our party.\" Later he quickly folded his new party due to lack of mass appeal and returned to the AIADMK, to be in J. Jayalalitha's camp and served as revenue minister from 1991-1996. Somasundaram was in charge for conducting the 8th Tamil World Conference at Thanjavur during his tenure as the revenue minister. Subsequently, due to difference of opinion with J. Jayalalithaa, he quit AIADMK again and floated another party called “ Puratchi Thalaivar AIADMK.” Mr. S.D. Somasundaram died on 6 December 2001 at Chennai, at the age of 79."

  "text" : "Sarah Katherine Ramsland, née McEwen (July 19, 1882 - April 4, 1964) was a Canadian politician, the first woman ever elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. She was born in Boon Lake, Minnesota, the daughter of local politician Bowman C. McEwen and the granddaughter of Minnesota Representative Charles D. McEwen. Trained as a schoolteacher, she married Max Ramsland, the son of Minnesota politician Ole Ramsland, in Buffalo Lake, Minnesota in 1906 and moved to Saskatchewan, settling first in Canora and later in Buchanan and Kamsack. Max Ramsland was elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 1917 provincial election as the Liberal MLA for Pelly, but died in 1918 in the Spanish flu epidemic, and Sarah Ramsland was elected to succeed him in the resulting byelection. Early in her term she was invited by Premier William Melville Martin to second the formal motion to accept a Speech from the Throne, but declined the honour. Ramsland was reelected in the 1921 election, and served until 1925. A backbench MLA, she rarely spoke in the legislature and was not prominent in the government until her final day in the legislature, when she introduced a resolution calling for an amendment to federal divorce laws that would permit women to apply for divorce on the grounds of a spouse's adultery, a privilege which was then only available to men. She was defeated in the 1925 provincial election by Progressive candidate Charles Tran. She subsequently worked for the provincial library and for a number of women's organizations. In 1942, she married Regina businessman William George Franklin Scythes. She died in Prince Albert in 1964, at the age of 81."

Agnew and his father, a chaplain for the loyalists, were captured in 1781 and released at the end of the war. He went to England where he married Sophia Winifred (last name unknown). In 1789, Agnew settled in New Brunswick near Fredericton. He served as a justice of the peace and a judge of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas for the county from 1799 until his death at his estate in York County in 1821. Agnew, a slave owner, challenged Judge Isaac Allen to a duel after the judge found in favour of an escaped slave in a trial held in 1800. Allen refused the challenge. Agnew later fought with Samuel Denny Street, one of the lawyers for the slave."

Knuth was born in the Queensland town of Tully. His brother Jeff Knuth is a former One Nation parliamentarian. Shane Knuth entered the state's parliament as the member for Charters Towers at the 2004 state election by defeating incumbent MP Christine Scott of the Labor Party. At the 2006 state election, Knuth was re-elected; but the redistribution ahead of the 2009 state election combined his district with that of One Nation MP Rosa Lee Long. From this contest, Knuth emerged the victor. He became, as a consequence, the inaugural member for the district of Dalrymple. On 30 October 2011, Shane Knuth resigned from the Liberal National Party to join Katter's Australian Party."

  "text" : "Spencer Chandra Herbert is a Canadian politician who was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. Representing the British Columbia New Democratic Party, he won the October 29, 2008, by-election in the electoral district of Vancouver-Burrard. He was re-elected to the Legislature, this time in the newly created riding of Vancouver-West End in the May 13, 2009 general election. Chandra Herbert's BC NDP formed the Official Opposition in both the 38th and 39th Parliaments and he was assigned to be the party's critic on tourism, arts and culture. He has introduced several pieces of legislation as private members' bills, though none have been adopted. The Long Term Tenants Protection Act, and his more comprehensive Residential Tenancy Amendment Act, were meant to address evictions and high rent increases that were occurring in the West End. He also introduced the Consumer Protection in Ticket Sales Act, 2009 which would have made ticket scalping illegal and the Gender Identity and Expression Human Rights Recognition Act which would have included gender identity and gender expression into the BC Human Rights Code as characteristic protected from discrimination. He entered the 38th Parliament at age 27, as its youngest Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and remained the youngest throughout the 39th Parliament. Prior to becoming a MLA, he was elected to the Vancouver Parks Board. He served as a Parks Commissioner between 2005 and 2008 and was then a member of the Coalition of Progressive Electors. On the Parks Board he voted against removing the requirement for a referendum on an expansion of the Vancouver Aquarium but later voted in favour of the expansion. He advocate for bicycle valet service at large public events, investigating environmentally friendly means of disposing of animal waste, and implementing a zero-net-loss of greenspace policy. He is openly gay and married his partner, Romi Chandra, in March 2010. Afterwards, he legally changed his name to Spencer Chandra Herbert. Both Spencer and Romi have been active supporting causes within the LGBT community. At the provincial level, Chandra Herbert has advocated for a community victim services worker in Davie Village, a specialized telephone line for people to call to report incidents involving gay-bashing or verbal and physical assaults, and for school boards to include LGBT issues, especially in anti-bullying lessons."

  "text" : "Sir Charles Ernest Swann, 1st Baronet, (25 January 1844 – 13 July 1929) was a British businessman and Liberal Party politician. He was born as Charles Ernest Schwann, fifth son of J Frederick Schwann of Gloucester Square, London (and originally from Frankfurt, Germany) and Henrietta Kell of Birmingham. His father carried on business in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, and Charles received his early education in the town. He subsequently attended Owen's College, Manchester and University College, London. Swann became a merchant in Manchester, and became a leading member of the Liberal movement in the city. He was, by turn, the secretary, treasurer and president of the Manchester Liberal Federation. He was also president of the Manchester Reform Club and for nine years president of the National Reform Union. In 1885 he was the unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the new constituency of Manchester North. However, another general election was held in the following year, and Swann was elected as member of parliament. He was to remain Manchester North's MP until 1918. He was regarded as an \"advanced radical\", and took an interest in the constitutional affairs of India, attending the opening of the National Indian Congress in 1890. In 1906 Charles Schwann was created a baronet \"of Prince's Gardens in the Royal Borough of Kensington\" and in 1911 he was as appointed to the Privy Council. In 1913 Schwann changed his surname to Swann by royal licence. He married Elizabeth Duncan in 1876, and they had four sons and a daughter. Sir C E Swann died at his residence in Birkdale, Lancashire in 1929, aged 85. He was buried in Putney Vale Cemetery."

In 1889 he stood as a candidate for the newly formed London County Council for the Progressive Party, the municipal wing of the Liberal Party. He contested Whitechapel, and was elected with 1,523 votes, along with his running mate, Charles Tarling, who polled 1,477 votes. He served for one term, before standing down in 1892. Samuel was selected as Liberal candidate for Whitechapel in 1900, in succession to his uncle Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling, who had been the MP. He knew the constituency well, having represented it on the LCC. He held the seat for the Liberals with an increased majority. When the Liberal Party won the 1906 election with a landslide, he was again returned at Whitechapel. The Liberal Party faced the elections in 1910 against a resurgent Conservative Party. Despite this challenge, Samuel was re-elected with an increased majority, at both 1910 elections. Over the course of four general election campaigns in Whitechapel, Samuel had increased the Liberal share of the vote each time, taking it from 50.4% to 59.2%, changing the constituency from a marginal to a safe seat. In 1912 he was created Sir Stuart Samuel, Baronet of Chelwood Vetchery. In April 1913 he undertook a contract for the Government, which required him to resign his seat and face re-election at a by-election. His Conservative opponent from 1910 ran against him in the by-election. He was re-elected with a reduced majority. Samuel retired from politics in 1916."

  "text" : "Sir Charles Merrik Burrell, 3rd Baronet (24 May 1774 – 4 January 1862) was an English Conservative politician, who represented the seat of New Shoreham for fifty-six years, becoming Father of the House of Commons. Burrell was born at Golden Square, London, the son of Sir William Burrell, 2nd Baronet and his wife Sophia Raymond. He succeeded to the title of Baronet Raymond of Valentine House on 20 January 1796. In 1806 he was elected as M.P. for New Shoreham and he held the seat until his death in 1862. Burrell built a country mansion near Knepp Castle, known by the same name, near West Grinstead  and purchased an estate at Boulton. He owned a house in Richmond Terrace, London which was the subject of a court case in 1833 in which he argued that because the house was on the site of the former Palace of Whitehall, it was not liable to the poor rate of St. Margaret's, Westminster. Burrell married Frances Wyndham, the illegitimate daughter of George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont and Elizabeth Ilive, on 4 July 1808 at St. George's Church, Hanover Square. Their eldest son Charles Wyndham Burrell died aged seventeen, but his other sons Percy and Walter succeeded successively to the baronetcy and the seat of New Shoreham."

A Democrat, she was a member of the Vermont House of Representatives, representing the Chittenden-6-5 district in Burlington from 2009 to 2015. First elected in 2008, she did not run for re-election in 2014. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Wizowaty grew up in Europe, Texas and Connecticut, graduating from Princeton University (BA cum laude, 1977) and Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont (MA, 1985). She lived in San Francisco, Chicago, and New Jersey before moving to Burlington in 1985. Wizowaty has worked as a bookseller, librarian, newspaper reporter and editor, also having experience in the non-profit sector with the Vermont Humanities Council and Vermont Works for Women. A published author, she has written two novels: The Round Barn (Hardscrabble, 2002) and A Tour of Evil (Philomel, 2005). In 2008, Wizowaty ran for the Vermont House of Representatives in the two-member Chittenden-3-5 district. She faced two incumbents in the Democratic primary but was the top vote-getter, beating Rep. Johannah Leddy Donovan into second place and Rep. Bill Keogh into third. In the general election held on November 4, the Democratic nominees – Wizowaty and Donovan – ran unopposed. She was re-elected to the House on November 2, 2010. Following redistricting, she was elected to represent the Chittenden 6-5 district in 2012. She did not seek re-election in 2014 and was succeeded by Mary Sullivan. Wizowaty is openly gay."

A self-described moderate Republican, Stan served in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly, including a successful run for the Oregon House of Representatives while in law school in 1972. Later he served as Oregon Superintendent of Public Instruction from 1999 to 2003, in a political career spanning four decades. In non-elective offices, he was chairman of the state's ethics commission and on the Oregon Traffic Safety Commission between stints in the legislature. Bunn also made unsuccessful attempts to be elected as Oregon Attorney General in 1976 and to serve in Congress representing Oregon’s first congressional district in 1996, when his brother was running for re-election in the neighboring Congressional district. Bunn faced scrutiny over back taxes while Superintendent of Public Instruction and also was accused of committing over one thousand ethics violations by the Oregon Government Ethics Commission, stemming primarily from the use of a state car and use of a state cell phone for personal use. Bunn challenged their findings and later reached a settlement in which he did not admit wrongdoing and paid $25,000 to the Commission in a payment that could not be called a fine."

Around 1802 he married Jane Oram and moved to Mahoning County, Ohio where he built a farm and the first grist mill in the area. He later married Sarah St. John and after her death Mary Peters. During the War of 1812 Wilkeson was asked to build a fleet of ships for the U.S. Army at Buffalo, brought his family there, and opened a general store. In 1815, he became the village's first Justice of the Peace and later chosen as a village trustee. He was a member of the Buffalo Harbor Company that brought the terminus of the Erie Canal to Buffalo, versus its rival Black Rock. In the early 1820s, he led the project to improve the harbor to make it suitable as the canal terminus. In February 1821, Wilkeson was appointed First Judge of the Court of Common Pleas and held this position until 1824. In the early 1820s he went into partnership with Ebenezer Johnson in shipping and real estate enterprises, and once owned the land on which the Buffalo City Hall now stands. His later ventures included building the first steam boiler in Buffalo and operating foundries or factories in several areas of the city. In 1822, Samuel Wilkeson was elected to the New York State Assembly and in 1824 was elected to the New York State Senate. In 1836, he was elected mayor of Buffalo. During his term he focused on law enforcement issues and presided over a city in the depths of a nationwide financial depression. After his term, in 1838, he became general agent of the American Colonization Society, who wanted to colonize African-Americans in Liberia. He died on July 7, 1848, on his way to visit his daughter who was now living in Tellico Plains, Tennessee. His body was brought back to Buffalo and buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery."

  "text" : "Sadashiv Kanoji Patil (abbreviated as S. K. Patil) (1898-1981) was a former Congress leader from Maharashtra. A veteran freedom-fighter, he was a qualified journalist, scholar and orator. He was thrice elected Mayor of Bombay and was known as \"the uncrowned king of Bombay\". He supported, assisted and nurtured a number of institutions, particularly in Mumbai and enriched the city culturally. He was the Member of Parliament from Bombay when it was part of the unified Bombay State. He was a Union Minister during the time of Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shashtri and Indira Gandhi. Though a three-time MP, he was defeated by George Fernandes in Mumbai South (Lok Sabha constituency) in 1967 for 4th Lok Sabha. He then fought a by-poll from Banaskantha in Gujarat and rejoined Lok Sabha. In 1969 he left Congress of Indira Gandhi with senior leaders like Morarji Desai and Nijalingappa. He contested from Banaskantha Lok Sabha seat in 1971 on Congress (O) ticket but lost to the Congress candidate. In the Lok Sabha discussions on the report of the States Reorganisation Commission, on 15 November 1955, Patil demanded that the Bombay city be constituted as an autonomous city-state, laying great stress on its cosmopolitan character. However, Bombay state was partitioned into the present day states of Gujarat and Maharashtra in 1960, and the city of Bombay (now called Mumbai) became the capital of Maharashtra."

He was elected to the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly as an Indian National Congress candidate from Alangulam constituency in the 1989 and 1991 elections. Ramasubbu's father S.Sudalaimuthu Nadar was active for the Indian National Congress party in Nellai District. Ramasubbu's political career started as the District Student Congress Secretary in 1972. After seven years working in a bank he became a full-time politician for the Congress party. In 1989 the Congress party committee for Tamil Nadu decided to contest the Assembly election independently without an alliance with a Dravidian party. Ramasubbu was selected to contest the Alangulam Constituency, which he won against Aladi Aruna and Karuppasamy Pandian. Ramasubbu stood again in the Assembly Election of 1991 and was voted in with a larger majority of 32,000 votes. In the 2009 General Election he was elected to the Lok Shabha by the Tirunelveli constituency voters. During that session of parliament he asked more than 1,000 questions and introduced the Fishermen (Welfare) Bill and the Special Educational Facilities Bill (For Children of Parents Living Below Poverty Line)."

  "text" : "(For those of a similar name, see Susan Davis (disambiguation).) Susan Margaret Davies (born 14 March 1954) is a former Australian politician. She was born in Mirboo North, Victoria, to parents Richard Llewellyn (dec) and Jean Margaret Davies (dec). She attended Leongatha High School (1966–70) and Watsonia High School in 1971, when she completed her Higher School Certificate. She received a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education in 1976 from Latrobe University. She subsequently became a secondary school teacher, and began farming in addition to this in 1989. Davies joined the Australian Labor Party in 1993, as part of the rural protest against Kennett government funding and service cuts, and was the Labor candidate for Gippsland West in the 1996 Victorian state election. Sitting Liberal MP Alan Brown resigned less than a year after the state election, precipitating a by-election. Labor declined to stand a candidate for this very safe Liberal seat; it and its predecessors had been in the hands of a conservative party for more than a century and a half. Davies resigned from the Labor Party and contested the by-election as an independent, emerging victorious. She retained her seat in the 1999 state election, and held the balance of power with two other rural Independents when a significant, mostly rural, and very anti-Kennett-government swing led to a hung parliament. Davies played a key role in developing the \"Independents' Charter\", which the three independents used as a basis for backing Steve Bracks and the Labor Party as the new minority government. She served on the Public Accounts and Estimates committee during the following parliamentary term. Prior to the 2002 election, Gippsland West was essentially replaced by the newly created seat of Bass, which was notionally Liberal in a traditional matchup. Davies contested Bass, but lost to the Liberal candidate, former MLC Ken Smith. She later rejoined the Labor Party and contested the 2004 federal election as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of La Trobe. She was defeated by the Liberal candidate, Jason Wood. Davies now runs a small farm in South Gippsland, is part of a local food producers' network and Korumburra Landcare, and is a director on several organisations, including Chairing Energy Innovation Co-operative Ltd, which promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency measures as a response to climate change and peak oil."

Vagheesam Pillai from Congress party was the second winner in both elections. He was a member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council between 1926 and 1932 and again between 1936 and 1947. After Independence, he was elected to the Assembly from the Chidambaram constituency and continued as a member till his death in 1959. Though a strong votary of Annamalai University, he criticised the institution on the floor of the Council when it spent more on teaching languages and subjects other than Tamil. He wondered whether a music department was necessary when people did not have food to eat. Early life of Swami : Born as Munusami in Pudupakkam near Arani in 1890, he was rechristened Sigamani in a Christian missionary school in Tindivanam. “He quit school when there was an attempt to convert him and other students to Christianity. He was forced to repay the money the school had spent on his food,” Sahajananda’s family migrated to Kolar in search of a livelihood and he was attracted to spiritualism there. He established contact with many spiritual leaders, and one of them, Karapadi Swami in Vyasarpadi, advised him to work for the welfare of Sambavars ( Paraiyars) in Chidambaram. It was he who named him Sahajananda. He established a mutt and a trust in the name of Nandanar, a medieval Paraiyar devotee and one of the 63 Saivite saints, in Chidambaram in 1916. Twenty-five students were admitted to his school. “He advocated education for Scheduled Caste girls. Mahatma Gandhi visited the school in 1926 and again in 1934. He mobilised funds for the family of freedom fighter V.O. Chidambaram Pillai,” He travelled to Singapore and Malaysia to give lectures on Saiva Siddantha. When there was opposition to Hindi, he spoke in support of teaching the language. He wanted Parayars to learn more languages, arguing that it would liberate them. In his institution, he taught Sanskrit to all students,”"

  "text" : "Stephen Paul Hatton (born 28 January 1948) is an Australian politician, who was Chief Minister of the Northern Territory of Australia from 1986 to 1988. From 1983 until his retirement in 2001, he was MLA for the seat of Nightcliff. He first became a minister in December 1984 in the Ian Tuxworth government. He played an important role in the referendum for statehood for the Northern Territory in 1998. He had served for many years on a bipartisan committee of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, which had recommended a constitution and an elected Constitutional Assembly to give it further consideration. The then Chief Minister, Shane Stone put forward a different constitution to a non-elected Constitutional Assembly. Steve Hatton was prominent in opposing this kind of statehood. The referendum failed, and he was reported as saying \"One of the campaign slogans at the time was: 'we want statehood, not Stonehood'\"."

  "text" : "(Not to be confused with Sara Henderson.) Sarah Moya Henderson (born 4 April 1964) is a former Australian broadcast journalist best known for her work on the ABC's The 7.30 Report and for her consumer advocacy on The Investigators. Henderson was born in Geelong and educated at Sacred Heart College before moving to The Geelong College where she graduated in 1981. She is the daughter of Ann Henderson, who was a member of the Victorian state parliament for Geelong from 1992 to 1999. In 1982, Henderson became a cadet reporter with Channel 7 in Melbourne. She went on to work with Channel 9 in Brisbane and then Channel 10 in Melbourne where she presented the weekend news with Alister Paterson and then moved to ABC-TV where she worked as a presenter of the consumer advocacy program The Investigators. Her media career included working as a presenter of the ABC's Holiday program (1992–1993), Australia's Most Wanted in 1994 and the Victorian presenter of The 7.30 Report in 1995. When The 7.30 Report became a national program in 1996, she continued working as the program's law correspondent and was also awarded a Walkley Award for her coverage of the Port Arthur massacre. In 1998, she obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree from Monash University and moved to a career in the law with the Melbourne firm Arthur Robinson & Hedderwicks. She worked as an attorney for News Corporation and was a weekly columnist with the Herald Sun newspaper from 2002 to 2004. At the same time she established the Kudos Management Group which led to business management roles with Network Ten and National Indigenous TV. In 2009, Henderson became the Liberal Party candidate for the federal seat of Corangamite, but narrowly lost to the ALP incumbent Darren Cheeseman in the 2010 election. In 2012 Henderson was preselected again as the Liberal Party's candidate for Corangamite at the 2013 federal election. She won the seat with a 4.6-point swing to the Liberal Party."

He was the national chairman of the Reform Party, and a frequent candidate on their ticket. He has since become a member of the Democratic Party. He is probably best known for his frequently running for mayor of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He has sought the office in 2005 and 2009. O'Hara first ran for Governor of Mississippi in 1991 as the Reform Party candidate. He received 11,253 votes, or 1.58%. He ran as the Reform Party candidate for the United States Senate in Mississippi in 2000. He received 7,315 votes, or 0.74% of the vote. In 2002 he ran for the U.S. Senate again and was the lone challenger to Thad Cochran. He received 97,226 votes, or 15.42%. While a member of the Reform Party, O'Hara supported the candidacy of George W. Bush. After his party nominated Ralph Nader as presidential candidate in 2004, O'Hara said he hoped Nader could spoil the election: \"I’m doing everything I can to make sure John Kerry never gets around the White House.\"This sentiment, and the fact that O'Hara was a supporter of the Ku Klux Klan's Samuel Bowers, and his statements that he had once favored the execution of abortion doctors, put O'Hara odds with other Reform Party members. In 2003 he was the Reform Party candidate for Governor of Mississippi and received 4,070 votes for 0.46% of the vote. In 2007 O'Hara ran as a Democrat for state treasurer and received 284,789 votes (39.47%). O'Hara sought the Democratic Party nomination for the United States Senate in 2008, however, he was defeated in the primary by Erik R. Fleming 65.8% - 34.2%. O'Hara ran for the seat in Mississippi's 3rd congressional district as a Democrat. Much to the chagrin of Reform Party members, O'Hara returned to their party in 2011. He announced he would run for governor on their ticket, and also filed to run for state treasurer as both a Democrat and a Reform Party candidate. He received 26,290 votes, or 3.01%, in the race for state treasurer. In Mississippi's 2012 election for U.S. Senate, O'Hara ran as the Reform Party candidate and received 13,194 votes, or 1.06%. He ran for Governor of Mississippi in the 2015 election, finishing last with less than 2% of the vote."

  "text" : "Sam Kahn (15 December 1911 – 25 August 1987) was a South African Communist and MP from 1949 to 1952, for one of the constituencies representing African voters. Born in Cape Town, he joined the Communist Party of South Africa and earned a LLB degree from the University of Cape Town in 1932. From 1938 onwards, he was nearly continuously a member of the central executive committee of the CPSA. From 1943 to 1952, he was a member of Cape Town city council, and on 17 November 1948 he was elected to South African House of Assembly as a Communist, representing African voters in the western Cape Province (from 1937 to 1960, African voters voted for 'native representative' MPs instead of constituency MPs with White voters), campaigning on his disapproval of Prime Minister Malan's \"nazi doctrine of white supremacy\". He made his maiden speech on 27 January 1949 during a debate on a no confidence motion moved by the leader of the opposition, Field Marshal J. C. Smuts. Expelled from parliament in 1952 upon suspicion of operating with illegal Communist organisations (the CPSA being outlawed in 1950), he left South Africa permanently in 1960 and settled down in the United Kingdom."

This victory is hailed by the media/local people as victory over government as more than 30 sitting BJP MLAs, 6 BJP MPs and 2 Rajasthan state Cabinet Ministers were over-seeing and were literally micro-managing the election campaign for BJP candidate. Sharwan Kumar was born in a family of farmers in a small village called Ghardu Ki Dhani in Surajgarh. He started his political career at a young age and was elected Sarpanch of his Village. He first fought MLA election in 1993 from Pilani and won as an independent candidate. In 2008 Legislative Assembly Elections, he changed his constituency from Pilani to Surajgarh due to Reservation of Pilani Seat. He again won from Surajgarh beating Bhartiya Janta Party Candidate Santosh Ahlawat over a margin of nearly 8000 Votes. He again fought MLA elections in 2013 but lost to BJP candidate Santosh Ahlawat with over 50,000 Votes. His loss came as a surprise among the people and that too, with such a huge margin. Since Santosh Ahlawat became an MP, the Surajgarh assembly seat again went to poll on 13 September 2014."

He was educated at Eton College and St John's College, Cambridge before entering the family bank Messrs Hoare and Co. He succeeded his uncle in the baronetcy in 1857 and moved to Stourhead. He was a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for Somerset and Wiltshire. In 1865 Hoare was elected Member of Parliament for Windsor but was unseated in 1866. At the 1868 general election he was elected MP for Chelsea. He held the seat until 1874. Hoare had a restless temperament and expensive tastes including hunting and horse racing which left him short of money. In 1883, during the agricultural depression, he had to sell at auction many of Stourhead’s treasures including Sir Richard Colt Hoare’s collection of books on British history and a series of watercolour paintings by Turner. Hoare left Stourhead and lived in France in his later years where he fell ill in 1894. He returned to London and died at the age of 70 at 12, West Eaton Place, Pimlico and was buried at Stourton. Hoare married Augusta Frances Clayton East, daughter of Sir E G Clayton East, in 1845. Their only son died in childhood, and the baronetcy passed to a cousin."

  "text" : "Stephen Dunham (born 1956) is a former Australian politician. He was the Country Liberal Party member for Drysdale in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 1997 to 2005. Dunham held the position of Health Minister in the Burke Government and held senior portfolios in opposition following Labor's victory in 2001. Dunham had skated to victory in both 1997 and 2001, and there was virtually no hint he was in any danger of losing his seat in 2005. Indeed, the redistribution ahead of that year's election made his already comfortably safe seat even more so, with a majority of 15.7 percent. However, in a shock result, Dunham was defeated by Labor challenger Chris Natt on a swing of 17.5 percent amid the massive Labor wave that swept through the Territory that year."

He was the Labor member for Arafura in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 1987 until his death in 1992. Tipiloura was born on Bathurst Island. He attended primary school there, before studying for two years at St John's College, Darwin and two years at Monivae College in Victoria. He worked for the CSIRO in Darwin after leaving school, and was a successful amateur footballer with St Mary's Football Club; he also played a stint for South Adelaide Football Club in South Australia in the late 1970s. He returned to Bathurst Island in 1975, where he worked in various roles, including for the Nguiu Council, of which he would subsequently be elected President. He returned to Nguiu permanently in 1980, where served as a police aide and then officer at Nguiu from 1980 to 1905. At the time of his election to parliament, he was also the president of the newly elected local branch of the Labor Party. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Arafura at the 1987 election, succeeding his brother-in-law and former Labor leader Bob Collins, who was contesting a seat in the Australian Senate. Tipiloura's election made him, at the time, one of the parliament's only Aboriginal members. Upon his election, he was appointed shadow minister for local government, administrative services, libraries, conservation, museums, and police, fire and emergency services. He contracted kidney failure shortly after his election, and spent some time on dialysis before his uncle donated a kidney in 1990. He was re-elected at the 1990 election from his hospital bed, and was made shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs after the election. However, the disease did not rescind and he died in Melbourne in 1992, aged 35. Tipiloura was the first serving member of the Northern Territory Parliament to die."

Mitchell was born in Gunnedah, and moved to Grafton as a child. She moved back to Gunnedah while in high school, graduating from Gunnedah High School in 1999. She moved to Sydney in 2001, and studied politics and international relations at the University of New South Wales. Mitchell later moved back to Gunnedah, where she worked as an electorate officer for former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson. She continued working for Mark Coulton, Anderson's successor as local MP, upon Anderson's 2007 retirement. She was later elected president of the federal Young Nationals and chairman of the state Young Nationals, positions which she held until her election to parliament. She was preselected for the eleventh position on the Coalition Legislative Council ticket for the 2011 state election in April 2010; while normally unwinnable, the near-record size of the Coalition's victory saw her emerge victorious for the last seat in an extremely close race with far-right independent Pauline Hanson. She married Anthony Mitchell in April 2011, and took her husband's name; she had been elected two weeks before under her maiden name of Johnston. She has served on several standing and select committees, and currently sits on the General Purpose Standing Committee No. 3. During her first years in Parliament, Sarah chaired the General Purpose Standing Committee No. 4, which undertook an inquiry into medicinal cannabis, resulting in a report unanimously in favour of the provision of medicinal cannabis for the terminally ill. Sarah is currently the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional and Rural Health and Western NSW, and was appointed to this portfolio on 24 April 2015."

  "text" : "Stephen Durham (born 1947) is an American activist based in New York City, and the Freedom Socialist Party (FSP) nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 general election. The socialist feminist FSP, a Trotskyist party, is running a write-in campaign that also includes Christina López, a Chicana feminist, for vice-president. Durham was born in North Carolina and grew up in Southern California. He attended the University of California at Berkeley during the 1960s, where he took part in protests of the Vietnam War and joined actions to gain Third World Studies. He was an early member of the gay rights movement and attended the first national lesbian and gay gathering, the West Coast Gay Liberation Conference, which took place in 1969 in Berkeley. Durham joined the Freedom Socialist Party and, in 1976, founded the Los Angeles branch of the organization. In 1984, he relocated to New York City, where he has served as the party organizer for many years. Durham worked as a union waiter in California and New York City. He mobilized with his female, of color and immigrant co-workers, during the 1985 New York City Hotel Trades Council strike by 16,000 workers. In this he was aided by his fluency in Spanish and Portuguese, which he gained in high school and retained through frequent travels to Latin America and the Caribbean where he has connected with other feminists and socialists. Durham’s first electoral effort for the FSP was in 1998, running for New York State Assembly the 71st District, a predominantly Latino and African American community. Campaign materials for the FSP claim that the party is “taking the unconventional route of a write-in campaign because corporate funding of the two major parties and restrictive ballot access laws stack the deck against minor parties.” According to Durham, “The FSP ticket is a chance for people to vote not only against something, but for something. The campaign is thrilled to be giving people a way to send a strong protest message, find new kindred souls, and strengthen organizing efforts for a future all workers deserve.” In California in 2012, Durham ran for the presidential nomination of the Peace & Freedom Party, a left-wing electoral ballot coalition. After a struggle against the Secretary of State's unilateral refusal to add Durham and Peta Lindsay, candidate for the Party for Socialism and Liberation, to the ballot, Durham was added to the list of primary candidates."

In 1913, with a partner, Morrey opened a hardware store in Shackleton. He served five years as reeve for the Regional Municipality of Miry Creek. Morrey organized the telephone company in Shackleton, helped organize the local school and worked with the Grain Growers.

  "text" : "Stephen J. McCormick (1828–1891) was a prominent printer and publisher in Oregon, United States, who served as mayor of Portland, Oregon, from 1859–1860. He was originally from Dublin, Ireland. He worked as a newspaper reporter in New York. He came to Portland with his wife in 1851. In Oregon, McCormick worked as a printer and publisher. In 1852, he opened a book shop in Portland, the Franklin Book Store. He began publishing a semi-weekly newspaper, The Portland Commercial, on March 24, 1853, but it was discontinued after a short life. He was elected as a Multnomah County delegate to the Oregon Constitutional Convention, held in 1857. He also served on the county commission and school board. He became a prominent publisher in Oregon, and his publications included the Oregon Almanac (originally known as McCormick's Almanac), Oregon Monthly Magazine, a city directory for Portland, and Abigail Scott Duniway's Captain Gray's Company (1859). In 1857, he was elected chief of the Portland Fire Department (established in 1854), serving for a brief period. He was elected mayor of Portland in April 1859, for a one-year term. During and after his term as mayor, he continued working in his main occupation, publishing. On May 13, 1859, he established another Portland newspaper, the Portland Daily Advertiser, which was only the second daily newspaper in the Pacific Northwest (the first being the Portland Daily News, which began publication less than four weeks before McCormick's Advertiser). It ceased publication – a suspension that became permanent – in October 1862. McCormick sold the paper before the start of the Civil War in 1861, the same year that The Oregonian became a daily paper. The Advertiser was pro-slavery and, according to a 1911 account by Henry Pittock, it took a pro-secession stance after the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President in March 1861, causing the paper to lose influence in Portland, where the majority of residents were pro-Union. It ceased publication the following year. McCormick subsequently moved to San Francisco, California, where he became editor of the Catholic Monitor newspaper. In 1889, he wrote the book, The Pope and Ireland. He died in San Francisco in 1891."

  "text" : "Simon Hayes was a police commissioner, having served as the Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioner for Hampshire Constabulary from 2012 to 2016. He was the first person to hold the post and was elected on 15 November 2012 as an Independent. He received 47,632 first preference votes from an electorate of nearly 1.5 million on a turnout of 14.6% at the PCC Election in 2012. Hayes is the chairman of Hampshire and Isle of Wight Crimestoppers and is a former chairman of the Hampshire Police Authority. In Hayes' previous role as Chairman of the Police Authority he was also a Conservative councillor on both Hampshire County Council and New Forest District Council. He was also the Conservative candidate for Mid Dorset and North Poole in 2005.Hayes is now one of the minority Independent PCCs country and as such has no party-political affiliations. In May 2013, Hampshire's PCC was identified by a House of Commons Select Committee as 'being responsible for the largest increase in the budget to run the PCC's office'. According to Hampshire Police the most of a £2 million budget increase went to meet the PCC Policing and Community Priorities. In December 2013 the Hampshire PCC announced further staff; appointing more Commissioners (one Deputy and two Assistants). Hayes faced accusations that he lives in Earls Barton, Northamptonshire, where his wife is vicar of All Saints' Church. However, the IPCC was satisfied that he lived in Hampshire."

  "text" : "Stan Lawlor (born August 4, 1943 in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador) is a Canadian politician and academic, who served as Mayor of North Bay, Ontario from 1984 to 1994. Educated in sociology at Memorial University of Newfoundland and the University of Alberta, Lawlor began teaching at Nipissing University College in 1967. He was first elected to North Bay City Council in 1973, and served as a city councillor until his elevation to the office of mayor, including serving as deputy mayor after 1978. He was appointed mayor in June 1984 following the death in office of Merle Dickerson, and was subsequently elected as mayor in the municipal elections of 1985, 1988 and 1991. His term in office was marked by initiatives that included the acquisition of the Dionne Quintuplets homestead as a community museum, the creation of a heritage train attraction in the city's Waterfront Park, the launch of \"Haleyfest\", a Christmas choral concert which still takes place annually in the city, and other economic development initiatives to revitalize the city's downtown and waterfront areas. During his term as mayor he also ran as an Ontario Liberal Party candidate in Nipissing in the 1990 provincial election, but lost to Mike Harris. He ran for another term as mayor of North Bay in the 2006 municipal election, but was defeated by incumbent mayor Vic Fedeli. Lawlor retired after teaching for nearly 45 years at Nipissing University. His son Sean Lawlor is also a former North Bay city councillor and deputy mayor. Since his retirement from Nipissing University, Lawlor has remained active as a consultant throughout Northern Ontario."

She was the Cambridge City Councillor for Petersfield ward between 2010 and 2014, serving as Executive Councillor for Community Wellbeing since 2013 and currently also serves as a member of the LGBT+ Liberal Democrats executive. She is a trans woman and, for several years, was the only openly transsexual elected politician in the UK. In 2011, she appeared on the Independent on Sunday \"Pink List\" as the 28th most influential LGBT person in the UK, dropping to 34th in the 2012 list, but rising again to 27th in the 2013 list. Brown is an advocate for equal marriage, and has several times discussed marriage laws as they affected her; her 2001 marriage to her wife Sylvia Knight was annulled upon gaining a Gender Recognition Certificate in 2009, and she described her subsequent civil partnership to Knight as a \"kick in the teeth\". Her case was cited during the report stage of the Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Bill, when her MP Julian Huppert moved a series of amendments, which included a set intended to allow couples who dissolved their marriages under the Gender Recognition Act to retroactively restore their marriage. Brown also advocates for improved provisions for transgender people under the National Health Service, and created the \"#transdocfail\" hashtag on Twitter and collated several thousand tweets talking about abuse of transgender patients that she alleges exposed \"institutional transphobia\" in the medical profession that \"would be on the national news\" if it \"was happening to any other minority\". Brown is currently in a polyamorous relationship with Knight and fellow Liberal Democrat and transgender activist Zoe O'Connell, although none of them describe themselves as \"poly evangelists\". All three partners contributed to a Guardian column discussing polyamory in the context of transition and Brown's previous marriage, which was later cited by Huppert during the Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Bill debate. She is currently a trustee of Cambridgeshire LGBT charities Encompass Network and SexYOUality"

  "text" : "Sheikh Ghiathadeen Naqshabandi  (1890–1944) (Kurdish: شیخ غیاسدین نەقشبەندی‎), was a senior Kurdish Sufi Sheikh, Muslim cleric, Islamic philosopher, scholar, poet, politician, and a prominent Iraqi-Kurdish personality from Bamarni, Iraq. Sheikh Ghiathadeen was born into a respected and intellectual family of Islamic Sufi scholars who settled in Bamarni in the 17th century and spent most of their life learning and teaching Islamic studies at the Takkiya (khanqah) of Bamarni. His family were well known for their piety, learning and influence throughout Kurdistan for years before him. After being educated at the Religious School of Amadiya, He followed his ancestors in following the Naqshbandi Sufi order. During his life he granted more than hundred religious scientific licenses for scholars from different parts of Iraq, Iran, and the Middle East in general, and sponsored the daily living and study costs of his students and followers. He also contributed to establishing many schools and mosques in Bamarni, Amadiya and in many different villages. The Sheikh was also accredited for opening the first school in the Bahdinan region and obliged all children to attend school. The idea of opening a school was not favored by the then ruling government, and decided they would not pay the salaries of the teachers. This caused the Sheikh to pay the teachers salaries with his own money."

  "text" : "Sherman Allyn Reynolds (December 29, 1878 – April 21, 1958) was the seventeenth and last President of the Chico Board of Trustees, the governing body of Chico, California from 1919 to 1923. He was born in Hamilton City, (which at the time was a part of Colusa County) the son of Edward Tillotson Reynolds and Frances Elizabeth Barnard Reynolds who were early settlers of Colusa County. Reynolds attended Woodman’s Academy in Chico, and Chico State Normal School, to which he enrolled at the age of seventeen, and continued for two and a half years. He then quit school to work in the fruit and nut business with his father, in 1898, when the firm of E. T. Reynolds and Son was established. Initially, they leased a warehouse, and eventually they bought a warehouse at the corner of First and Cedar Streets in Chico. In 1902, they built another warehouse, which had a railroad spur adjoining it at First and Cherry Streets. This warehouse still existed into the 21st-century, and was part of the Chico State campus under the same name as \"Reynolds Warehouse.\" By 1915, they were the largest handlers of almonds in the state. Their dried fruit business grew to the capacity of thirty-five hundred tons annually. Reynolds, with in partnership with others, owned the Cana Land Company, which comprised two hundred acres of fruit and nuts at Cana. Reynolds married Helen Adelia \"Nellie\" Davisson, in Suisun, in 1908. She was a Chico Normal School graduate, and school teacher until her marriage. In 1915, he was elected from the third ward as a trustee of the city. He served as chairman of the commission on fire, light and water. In 1919, he was elected president of the board of trustees. On June 4, 1921, an election was held to choose a Board of Freeholders charged with framing a City Charter. On April 16, 1923, at-large elections were reinstated under the charter. Under the charter, the board of trustees was renamed the Chico City Council, and its chair was titled the Mayor. Reynolds was the last mayor to be titled \"president\" of the \"board of trustees\" before it became the modern Chico City Council."

  "text" : "Samuel Smith (ca. 1646 – ca. 1735) was an early settler of Norwalk, Connecticut. He was a deputy of the General Assembly of the Colony of Connecticut from Norwalk in the May 1691 session. Due to the commonality of the name, and conflicting records, it is difficult to determine the exact origins of Samuel Smith. He was, perhaps, the son of Captain William Smith, a magistrate in Weymouth, Massachusetts Bay Colony. He moved to Norwalk as a young man, and he listed among its earliest settlers. His father-in-law, Matthew Marvin, Sr. gave Smith half of his home lot and orchard. In 1672, he owned \"a parcel of land in Indian Field,\" not far from the Norwalk-Westport boundary. He was named a freeman in 1674. In 1679, he served as town treasurer. He was on a committee, along with Matthew Marvin, Sr., and John Bowton to obtain a minister for the settlement, which appointed Reverend Thomas Hanford. He served as a deputy of the Connecticut General Court in 1691. He was a townsman in 1698, 1702, 1706, and 1712. In 1702, he was selectman. In 1680 or 1681 he owned a home-lot of four acres adjacent to Strawberry Hill."
