  "text" : "Frederick Cope (July 9, 1860 – September 19, 1897) was the third Mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, serving from 1892 to 1893. Cope was born in Oxford, England in 1860. After moving to Canada, and later British Columbia, he was president of the British Columbia Building Association and operated a dry goods, millinery, tailoring and grocery business. Cope defeated John Thomas Carroll in the 1892 mayoral election, one of the most hotly contested and closest in the city's history, winning with an 11 vote majority. He is the youngest elected mayor in the history of Vancouver, having been aged 32 at the time of his election. During the election, he garnered support of the city's business class, and the Vancouver World newspaper. His council however would consist of \"reformers\" of the working class, in opposition to Cope's representation of the business class. During his mayoralty, the city experienced an economic downturn; Cope responded by attempting to limit civic expenses, including the laying off of city employees, and initiating cutbacks. He also advocated for the Canada-Australia Steam Line, with the inaugural ship arriving in June 1893. Cope was a Freemason. He drowned during the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897 at Summit Lake, Yukon, when his horse fell while crossing the body of water. He tried unsuccessfully to rescue the horse and was pulled away by the undercurrents. His body was later transported back to Vancouver in the same vessel along with notorious American con artist Soapy Smith which resulted in a mixup of the bodies at their respective funerals. They were later switched upon the realization of the error. He was later buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver."

  "text" : "Frederick Buscombe (September 2, 1862 – July 21, 1938), was the 11th Mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He served from 1905 to 1906. A glassware and china merchant, he was a President of the Vancouver Board of Trade in 1900. Buscombe was born in 1862 at Bodmin, Cornwall, England, to Edwin and Isabella Oliver Grilles Buscombe. He immigrated to Canada with his family in 1870, settling near Hamilton, Ontario, where his father became a builder. He first worked in Hamilton from 1878 to James A. Skinner & Company, a glassware and china company, as a travelling salesman from 1878 to 1891. In 1891, his job with the company brought him west to Vancouver, where he established an office with his brother, George. Prior to 1891, he visited the Vancouver area twice, in 1884 and 1886. He served as a partner of the company in Vancouver until 1899, when he bought out the company, and established Frederick Buscombe & Co. Ltd. china, glassware and earthenware with his brother, which grew to be one of the largest businesses of the kind in the Canadian West. He was also president of the Pacific Coast Lumber & Sawmills Company, and director of the Pacific Marine Insurance Company. In 1899, he commissioned the Buscombe Building, located at 342 Water Street & 403 West Cordova Street, in Gastown, Vancouver, which is now the site of a restaurant and various businesses. Buscombe was elected Mayor of Vancouver in 1905. During the election, he advocated for improved financial management within the municipal affairs, earning support from three newspapers, and many businessmen. He served two terms, until 1906. During his mayoralty, he helped develop the Greater Vancouver Water Board. The city council also passed a motion to request suspension of immigration of East Indians to Vancouver due to public discontent of immigrants working in the growing amount construction jobs. Buscombe served as president of Vancouver's Board of Trade from 1900 to 1901, and as president of the Vancouver Tourist Association in 1901. A Mason, he was also a member of the Vancouver Club, Royal Vancouver Yacht Club, Terminal City Club, Jericho Country Club, and the Sons of England Society. He died at Vancouver 1938 and was buried at Mountain View Cemetery. At the time of his death, he was married to Cora Elsie Bird. He married Lydia Rebecca Mattice on May 6, 1886, with her he had five children: Robert Frederick Edwin, Harold Edwin, Erie Stewart, Margery Gordon, and Barnett. He lived in Dundurn, Vancouver. A member of the Church of England, he enjoyed yachting, fishing and golf."

Before it folded, she wrote a column in the County Edge, a weekly publication in Union County, and still weighs in on local political issues including a fight against a half-cent prepared food and beverage tax that would have helped build a civic center in Monroe. Fern Shubert was one of the candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination to challenge Governor Mike Easley in the 2004 election. The sole woman in a field of six contenders for the GOP nomination, Shubert campaigned as an outsider to the party establishment, but placed fifth in the primary, gathering only 4% of votes cast. Shubert ran to return to her old Senate seat in 2010. She lost the Republican primary on May 4 to Tommy Tucker. In 2012, Shubert filed to run for North Carolina State Auditor."

He served from 1 July 1896 to 1901. He was also an amateur painter, photographer and antique collector. He was born in Belper, Derbyshire, Britain and was educated at the Dollar Academy in Scotland and St Peter's School, York. He was a descendant of Mathew Swetenham, Henry IV's bow bearer. He was one of close to forty former British Empire officials to oppose the Malayan Union. Swettenham co-authored a \"A Dictionary of the Malay Language\" with Hugh Clifford. The dictionary, which was published in stages between 1894 and 1902, was abandoned after the letter 'G' as by then it had been made redundant by the publiciation of R.J. Wilkinson's \"A Malay English Dictionary\". He also published four books \"Malay Sketches\", \"Unaddressed Letters\", \"Also & Perhaps\" and \"Arabella in Africa\", the latter being illustrated by the famous mural painter and illustrator, Rex Whistler. The book was Whistler's first official commission."

  "text" : "Frances Nunziata is a Toronto city councillor for Ward 11 York South-Weston (representing one of the two York South—Weston wards). She is the sister of former Member of Parliament John Nunziata. An accounting clerk, she became head of the Harwood Ratepayers Association. She was first elected to office in 1985 as school board trustee for the City of York School Board. In 1988 she was elected to the York city council ousting incumbent Gary Bloor. On city council she rose to prominence as a whistleblower in the Fairbank Park affair. A deal had been made to sell part of the city park to a developer to build condominiums. Nunziata leaked material to the press illustrating irregularities in the process, leading to a police investigation of several local politicians. The affair pitted Nunziata against almost the entire York city council in a bitter debate. Nunziata took fellow councillor Nicolo Fortunato to court after he reportedly called her a \"slut\" and threatened to kill her. In the 1991 elections Nunziata was vindicated as six of the eight sitting councillors lost their reelection bids while Nunziata defeated her nearest rival by a ten to one margin. Eventually two York city councillors, one Metro Toronto councillor, and the developer were jailed over the affair. In the 1994 election Nunziata chose to challenge York mayor Fergy Brown. Nunziata was considered unlikely to defeat the incumbent, but after a spirited and often bitter campaign she emerged victorious. As mayor she ran into her own ethics issues when it was alleged she had used city money to pay a political operative. As mayor her main cause was an unsuccessful campaign to construct a subway line under Eglinton avenue. With the creation of the megacity in 1997 she was elected to Toronto city council. On city council she mostly concerned herself with law and order issues. She also was a prominent defender of Kimberley Glasco in her battle with the National Ballet of Canada. In 2010, George Berger, an executive assistant who worked for her in 2005 brought her before a human rights tribunal claiming harassment and discrimination during his employment. Berger claims that he was targeted due to a disability. Nunziata denies the claim. Berger is asking for monetary compensation and an apology. On December 7, 2010 she was nominated by Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday and elected as Speaker of Toronto City Council."

  "text" : "Frank Arthur Cooper (16 July 1872 – 30 November 1949) was Premier of Queensland from 1942 to 1946 for the Australian Labor Party. He was born on 16 July 1872 at Blayney, New South Wales, the son of an English miller and his Irish wife who had immigrated to Australia. Frank was educated in Sydney and worked as a clerk in various capacities around Sydney, including the Sydney diocese of the Anglican church and the Westinghouse brake company. In the latter capacity he moved to postings around the country before settling in Ipswich, Queensland where the main railway workshops for the State of Queensland were located. Cooper joined the Brisbane Clerical Union and became involved in Labor politics in Ipswich, including as president and secretary of the Ipswich Workers' Political Union, and was involved in the eight-hour day movement in provincial Queensland. His political activities, particularly his support for workers strikes in the state in 1912, caused him to run afoul of employer and he was dismissed, and Cooper subsequently became a journalist and activist within the Labor movement. He became editor of the Queensland Leader, a workers publication in Ipswich, in 1915 and remained so until 1925. In 1915 he was tapped to run for the seat of Bremer in the Queensland Parliament, a seat based in Ipswich which he would hold for the next three decades. In 1924 he became an alderman and eventually deputy-mayor for Ipswich City Council. In 1925 he married Agnes Hardy. Cooper had joined the first majority ALP government in Queensland under T. J. Ryan shortly after his election and became a prominent and well regarded member of the administration. Labor went back to opposition in 1929 but Cooper soon distinguished himself as an effective debater and parliamentarian. His reputation was such that he became Assistant Treasurer and Secretary for Public Instruction upon the election of William Forgan Smith as premier of a new ALP government in 1932. By 1938 Cooper was sitting on the Queensland ALP's central executive and was treasurer. He excelled in the position: that year he delivered the state's first budget surplus since 1927. He became deputy leader of the parliamentary party in September 1940, and played a key role in preparing Queensland's resources and mobilization for the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific. In 1942, the Federal ALP government under John Curtin introduced uniform taxation which ended the system of dual income taxes levied by both the states and the Commonwealth, instead making the Commonwealth the sole collector of income taxes with grants to be given back to the states to compensate for any losses. Many states, including Queensland, challenged the law in the High Court but were ultimately unsuccessful. Although William Forgan Smith accepted the decision he resigned soon after, and Cooper was duly elected to replace him as Premier of Queensland. Although now in his 70s, Cooper was an ardent supporter of the Commonwealth's prosecution of the war effort and worked with Curtin closely, sometimes invoking the ire of his own party in Queensland. Cooper continued in the premier role throughout the war, however at the war's end he stood down in favour of his Treasurer Ned Hanlon. In retirement he was active in the Anglican synod and on the senate of the University of Queensland, and died at his home in 1949. Cooper was accorded a State funeral which took place from St John's Cathedral to the Mount Thompson crematorium."

  "text" : "Frank Leslie Chester (November 30, 1901 – August 13, 1966) was a politician in the Canadian province of Manitoba, who served on Winnipeg City Council and in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. Born in Winnipeg, Chester was educated in Vancouver, British Columbia, and returned to Winnipeg later in life. He worked as a hardware merchant, and served as an alderman in Winnipeg from 1947 to 1950. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature as a Liberal-Progressive in the 1949 provincial election in the constituency of Winnipeg North, which elected four members by a single transferable ballot. Chester finished third on the first count, and was declared elected on the eighth and final count. He served as a backbench supporter of Douglas Campbell's government during his time in the legislature. He did not seek re-election in the 1953 provincial election, but instead ran as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada for Winnipeg North in the 1953 federal election. He lost to CCF candidate Alistair Stewart by 5,911 votes."

  "text" : "Frances Ellen Bedford (born 5 November 1953) is an Australian politician, representing the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party in the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Florey since the 1997 election. Bedford was born in Sydney and moved to Melbourne and then Adelaide after the death of her mother. She became involved in politics and became an electorate officer for former Labor MP Peter Duncan. She was elected to State Parliament in the 1997 state election. Hailing from the Socialist Left faction of the Australian Labor Party, Bedford has described herself as being South Australia's most left-wing MP. Her support for the Relationships Bill 2005, a bill which extends legal protections to same-sex couples, has made her a target of fundamentalist groups. Her opinions are considered by some as being incompatible with the opinions of her 'bible belt' electorate. Despite this, she was returned at the 2006 state election with a swing of more than 10 points (two-party-preferred), exceeding the statewide swing to the Labor government and defeating her Liberal opponent Pat Trainor, a former pastor in the Assemblies of God. As of the 2014 state election, Bedford holds Florey with a margin of 2.5 points."

It is Book who is credited with saving Perth Oval from being acquired by the army for use as a depot. In 1956 as a tribute to his service to the club, the new grandstand was named in his honour. The F.D. Book Stand still stands to this day although Perth Oval is no longer used for Australian rules football. He also had East Perth's best and fairest award, the F. D. Book Medal, named in his honour. At the 1950 state election, Book stood for the Liberal Party in the seat of East Perth, but was defeated by the sitting Labor member, Herb Graham."

Roscoe, was educated at University College and the University of London and came to British Columbia in 1862, settling in the Ross Bay area of Victoria, British Columbia. He was the younger brother of poet William Caldwell Roscoe and the grandson of English historian and writer William Roscoe. In 1864, he married Anna Letitia Le Breton. Roscoe was a partner in several hardware and ironware ventures. In 1870, he became the Commissioner of Savings Banks for the British Columbia colony. Roscoe stood for election as an Independent Liberal candidate in the Canadian federal election in 1874 in the two-member Victoria riding. He placed second in a close three-way race and was elected along with Liberal incumbent Amor De Cosmos. Roscoe did not stand for re-election in 1878 and died later in the year in Victoria at the age of 47. He was replaced in the seat by incoming Prime Minister John A. Macdonald who had lost his Ontario seat earlier as the BC portion of the election was delayed, and because he was deemed unelectable in eastern Canada due to ongoing politics surrounding his role in the Pacific Scandal. Roscoe's Victoria home is today preserved by The Land Conservancy of BC as a rare example of a pre-Confederation colonial house."

Haynes served until 1992 when he retired and was succeeded by Geoff Hoon. Haynes was famous for having one of the loudest voices in the House of Commons. He was sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers, and during the 1984-85 strike remained loyal to the union rather than support the majority of Nottinghamshire miners who broke away to form the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. He frequently highlighted the problems of the very poorest in society when putting questions to Margaret Thatcher and her ministers. Haynes died in Westwood, Nottingham, in September 1998 at the age of 72."

  "text" : "Frank Julian Allaun (27 February 1913 – 26 November 2002) was a British Labour politician. Born in Manchester, Allaun was educated at Manchester Grammar School and worked as an engineer, shop assistant, tour leader, chartered accountant and journalist. He helped to organise the first Aldermaston March in 1958 and was chair of the Labour Peace Fellowship. Allaun was against British membership of the EEC. Allaun contested Manchester Moss Side in 1951. He was Member of Parliament for Salford East from 1955 to 1983. He was a veteran of leftwing causes, especially the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), of which he was vice president from 1983. He was the first President of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy in 1973. Allaun wrote several books on nuclear weapons including Stop the H-Bomb Race (1959) and The Wasted 30 Billions (1975). Naive or optimistic, or just unappreciative of war culture, Allaun was a straight up-and-down idealist. His style was intensely gentle, the voice never raised, but the questions - chiefly on peace and housing - insistent. The beautiful manners and the soft Lancashire voice must have got on ministerial nerves. But then, as one of the organisers of the first Aldermaston march, he helped launch a movement whose appeal in the late 1950s and 1960s did more than get on nerves. Outside the peace movement, his preoccupation was with public housing, and the vastly increased expenditure he urged should be paid for by cuts, equally massive, in defence. Defence cuts would, of course, come, but, despite Allaun's life work, Britain remained a nuclear power. Frank Allaun retired from the House of Commons in 1983 but continued to be active in politics. This included writing the books Spreading the News: A Guide To Media Reform (1989) and The Struggle for Peace (1992). His recreations were walking and swimming. His first wife died in 1986, and on 3 June 1989 he married Millicent (Millie) Bobker, née Greenberg, a widow and retired civil servant. He died in Manchester in 2002 aged 89. His second wife, son and daughter survived him."

He later became a maintenance engineer in the 2LO station which later became the BBC. In 1926 he became chief engineer of the Indian Broadcasting Company in Calcutta, where he remained for three years before becoming the general manager of a firm in High Wycombe producing radio and television equipment. In the landslide election of 1945 he won the Elland constituency from the Conservatives. When this seat was abolished for the 1950 general election he transferred to the new constituency of Brighouse and Spenborough which covered much of the same area. He died just over a month later, aged 49, making the government's slender majority even more precarious until the party held the seat a by-election in May 1950."

He volunteered to join the RAF in 1941, aged 18, and served with 115 Squadron, which flew Lancaster bombers from bases in East Anglia in the Second World War. He married his wife, Muriel, in 1943, and was demobilised as a warrant officer in 1948. He returned to Liverpool and worked as a salesman for Fitzpatricks (a wholesale greengrocer and flower merchant), as a crane driver in Liverpool Docks, and then as a telephonist for the General Post Office. He joined the Labour party in 1948, and became member of Liverpool City Council for the St Domingo ward in 1964. He lost his seat in 1967, but was re-elected for the Vauxhall ward in 1969. He resigned from the council when he was elected as MP for Liverpool Scotland in a by-election held in April 1971, after the sitting Labour MP Walter Alldritt had resigned to become regional secretary of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers. Marsden had previously served at Alldritt's agent. In Parliament, Marsden was a strong supporter of comprehensive schools. Marsden's constituency was merged with the neighbouring Liverpool Exchange for the February 1974 general election, and Robert Parry won the selection for the new Liverpool Scotland Exchange seat. Marsden returned to his job at the GPO. He remained a loyal supporter of the Labour Party, and was later elected as a councillor on Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council and Merseyside County Council. He disagreed with the Militant tendency in the 1980s. His wife died in 2001, but Marsden was survived by their three sons. He died in Liverpool."

However, a Conservative candidate did stand at the 1922 general election, and Mallalieu was reduced to third place, losing his seat to the Labour Party's Philip Snowden. His share of the vote had fallen from 58.8% in 1918 to only 25.1% in 1922. Mallalieu did not stand for Parliament again, and died in 1932, aged 71.

Sir Frederick Burrows was a former Ross railway man and he was the president of the National Union of Railwaymen, the union representing railway workers in England. Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart records: \"He had endeared himself to the Burrah Sahibs of Calcutta with one of his first speeches when, alluding to his modest beginning on the railway, he said, 'When you gentlemen were huntin' and shootin', I was shuntin' and hootin'. He seemed to me to be far more proud of having been a sergeant-major in the Grenadier Guards in the First World War than he was of being Governor of Bengal.\""

  "text" : "Sir Thomas Frederick Halsey, 1st Baronet PC (9 December 1839 – 12 February 1927) was an English Conservative Party politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1874 to 1906. Halsey came from one of the most prominent families of Hertfordshire, whose seat was at Gaddesden Place, near Hemel Hempstead. He was the son of Thomas Plumer Halsey and his wife Frederica Johnston, daughter of General F. Johnston. His father was Member of Parliament (MP) for Hertfordshire from 1847 until he was drowned with his wife and his younger son in the shipwreck of the steamer Ercolano in the Gulf of Genoa on 24 April 1854. Frederick Halsey was at Eton at the time. He progressed from there to Christ Church, Oxford. He rowed in the losing Oxford eight in the Boat Race in 1860. After graduating in 1861, Halsey took up the life of a county notable in Hertfordshire, obtaining a commission in the North Hertfordshire Yeomanry and becoming a Justice of the Peace. He was chairman of the Gaddesden School Board. At the 1874 general election Halsey was elected Conservative MP for Hertfordshire and served in the post until 1885, when the constituencies were reorganised under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. the 1885 general election he was elected for Watford. He was also an alderman of Hertfordshire County Council from 1888, and was particularly interested in the Hertfordshire Constabulary. He served as deputy chairman of the St Albans Quarter Sessions from 1889 to 1908. In 1899 he was elected Chairman of the House of Commons Standing Orders Committee (and the added chairmanship of the Committee of Selection), and for service in this role was appointed to the Privy Council after the accession of King Edward VII on 24 January 1901, entitling him to the style \"The Right Honourable\". Halsey held his seat until 1906, when he lost to the Liberal candidate Nathaniel Micklem. After his parliamentary defeat he once more devoted himself to county affairs, serving as chairman of the St Albans Quarter Sessions from 1908 to 1918. No decision of his court was ever appealed. He finally retired from the Hertfordshire Yeomanry with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, having served as second-in-command, and then joined the county Territorial Force association, becoming its chairman. He was an active Freemason, and served as Deputy Grand Master of England and Second Grand Principal of the Supreme Grand Chapter of the Royal Arch from 1903. In December 1908, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Hertfordshire. He was created a baronet on 22 June 1920, in the 1920 Birthday Honours. Halsey lived at Gaddesden Place, Hemel Hempstead. He died at the age of 87. Halsey married Mary Julia Wells in 1865. His fourth son was Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey."

Descended from a well known family of cotton spinners from Bolton, Lancashire, Franklin Thomasson was born on 16 August 1873 at Alderley Edge, Cheshire, the 3rd child of John Pennington Thomasson, who was a benefactor and MP for Bolton. He married Elizabeth, a daughter of the late Caleb Coffin of New York on 11 July 1895. They had 3 children, John (1898), Marjorie (1901) and Barbara (1903). Franklin contested the Westhoughton Parliamentary division in 1900, and Stretford in 1901, but on both occasions he was unsuccessful. He became Liberal MP for Leicester at a by-election in 1906, however, sharing the representation of the double-member constituency with Ramsay MacDonald. He retired at the January 1910 election. In 1906, Thomasson ventured on a bold but disastrous experiment in newspaper production by founding the Tribune (1906–1908). He played a large part in local political life before he left Bolton for London. During World War I he commanded the 2-5th Battalion Loyal North Lancashire Regiment. His wife Elizabeth died in 1927 and he then married Gertrude Prescott. They had three children, Margaret (1930), Christopher (1932) and Jenny (1937). Franklin died of cancer on 29 October 1941 aged 68 and was buried at Lyndhurst, Hampshire."

  "text" : "Khan Bahadur Sayyid Sir Fazl Ali, also known as Fazal Ali OBE (19 September 1886 – 22 August 1959) was governor of Assam and Odisha and a judge. He headed the Fazal Ali Commission that made recommendations about the reorganization of India's states. He was governor of Odisha from 1952 to 1956 and of Assam from 1956 to 1959. He died while serving as governor of Assam. He was also bestowed with the Padma Vibhushan by the Indian Government. Whilst in Assam, he was the first to bring the Nagas into societal mainstream. He opened a college in the Naga heartland Mokokochung, which is now known as 'Sir Fazal Ali College of Arts'. The College celebrated its 50 years' anniversary in 2010. He belonged to an aristocratic Zamindar family of Bihar. Sir Fazl Ali was appointed, successfully, to the title of Khan Sahib, as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1918 and to the title of Khan Bahadur. He was knighted in the 1941 New Year Honours list and invested with his knighthood on 1 May 1942 by the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow. His eldest son, the late Syed Murtaza Fazl Ali Ali followed in his footsteps. He became a judge at the age of only 35, of the J&K High Court, in 1958, and was elevated as the Chief Justice of the same court in 1966. He was elevated as a Judge of the Supreme Court of India (like his father 'Sir Fazal Ali') in 1975. He died in 1985 while a sitting judge."

Egerton was the second son of Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere, younger son of George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland. His mother was Harriet Catherine, daughter of Charles Greville. He joined the Royal Navy in 1840, and immediately saw active service due to the Oriental Crisis of that year: he served off the Syrian coast and was present at the bombardment of Acre. During the Crimean War he was in command of HMS Bailisk and in 1855 he reached the rank of captain. Egerton married Lady Louisa Caroline, daughter of William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, and sister of Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire, in 1861. He was aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria from 1865-1873. In 1873 he was promoted to rear admiral and he was placed on the retired list in November 1875. Following his retirement he continued to be promoted: in 1878 to vice admiral and in 1884 to the rank of admiral. He also sat as Member of Parliament for Derbyshire East from 1868 to 1885 and for Derbyshire North-East from 1885 to 1886. In his later years he was a resident of Surrey, where he continued his political activities as president of the Chertsey Division of the Central Liberal Council. He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of the county in 1893. He died at his home in Weybridge from heart disease aged 71 and was buried at Byfleet."

Frank Ogbuewu who until August 2010 was a member of the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) sought his former party's gubernatorial ticket in 2007 against the current governor of Ebonyi State, Chief Martin Elechi but lost. He later vied for the PDP national chairmanship position but was not successful. On August 28, 2010 during the traditional marriage of his oldest daughter, Nnenna Ogbuewu, the Ambassador announced his intention to vie once again, for the office of Governor in his home state of Ebonyi but this time, under a different party. His party of choice, the All Progressives Grand Alliance was made known in September, 2010. On January 12, 2011, Ambassador Ogbuewu was nominated by the All Progressives Grand Alliance with a total vote of 1852 to represent the party in the forthcoming general elections that will be held in Nigeria on April 16, 2011."

  "text" : "Frank Logue (August 18, 1924 – December 31, 2010) was the 25th mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, serving from 1976 to 1979. His mother was widowed, leaving her to support five children during the Great Depression on a kindergarten teacher's salary. Frank Logue and his three brothers all attended Yale University, where, after Pearl Harbor, they enlisted in the military reserves. Frank Logue was called to active duty in 1943, served as an infantry soldier in France, and returned to Yale, graduating in 1948, and going on to attend Yale Law School. In the Spring of 1947, Frank Logue served as President of the Yale Political Union. Logue entered politics in Trumbull, Connecticut in 1953, becoming a Democratic district leader, then a prosecutor, and then town attorney. He ran for state representative in 1960, and lost. He served in the Kennedy administration as a part-time staff person for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. At age 40 he moved his family to New Haven, where he organized and directed an institute to train community organizers and neighborhood workers in the War on Poverty. He later created and directed \"National Urban Fellows\", an urban leadership development program for minorities and women. He was subsequently elected to the New Haven Board of Aldermen, representing the city's 18th Ward for two two-year terms, from 1972 to 1975. Bucking the New Haven Democratic party machine, he ran as a liberal reform candidate against the party's candidate, incumbent Bart Guida, in the 1975 mayoral primary and went on to win the primary and the general election. He took office as mayor on January 1, 1976. Logue ran as the standard bearer of liberal reformers looking to topple the party machine overseen by Guida’s patron, the late party Chairman Arthur Barbieri. It was a heady campaign; key workers included future Congresswoman, Rosa DeLauro; presidential adviser, Stan Greenberg; and state judge, Thayer Baldwin. Once in office, Logue had the luck of presiding over the city during a period of national urban decline. Employers, retailers, and middle-class families finished a suburban exodus from New Haven that began during the heady “Model City” urban renewal period that saw a record amount of federal and foundation dollars pour into the city, only to leave it poorer. In the late 1970s, much of downtown was boarded up and a general malaise had settled over the city. Logue was an early advocate of historic preservation, an antidote to the destruction of so much of the city’s landscape during urban renewal. Logue also believed the arts could help revitalize the city. He came up with the original idea of reviving the Shubert theater as part of a downtown arts renaissance, an idea his successor put into action along with an emphasis on preservation. Logue started the process of reviving downtown with the rehabilitation of the old Taft Hotel. Logue also helped push the state to create the PILOT (payments in lieu of taxes) program for cities. He won renomination in the September 1977 primary by a margin of 243 votes over challenger Biagio DiLieto and was re-elected to a second term in November of that year. However, he lost the primary to DiLieto in his bid for a third two-year term in 1979. Frank Logue's brother Edward, a Yale Law School graduate who married the daughter of William DeVane, dean of Yale College, was an influential city planner who was Mayor Lee's right-hand man on most administrative matters. After leaving the mayor's office, Logue was an active civic volunteer in New Haven and worked as a labor arbitrator and as a consultant to organizations including the Ford Foundation. He died in Hamden, Connecticut, on December 31, 2010."

Born and brought up in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, and educated at elementary school, he began work aged 13 as a moulder-apprentice, joining the Moulders' Union in 1914. In the same year he was awarded a place at Ruskin College, Oxford. He also joined the Independent Labour Party and was elected to its National Council. In the First World War he became active in the Union of Democratic Control, and was arrested for making a speech appealing for immediate peace negotiations. In 1916 he was offered the chance of exemption from military service on trade and health grounds, but preferred to take his stand as a conscientious objector. Refused exemption in that category, he was forcibly enlisted, and sentenced to two years imprisonment for disobeying an order; he then accepted the Home Office Scheme, and was transferred to Princetown Work Centre in the erstwhile Dartmoor Prison. Fred Longden was elected Member of Parliament for Birmingham Deritend, 1929-1931 and 1945-1950, and then in 1950 for Birmingham Small Heath, which he retained until his death in 1952 aged 58."

Fish, a B.A. graduate of University of New Brunswick (1910), obtained an M.A. in classics from University of Chicago (about 1913), before completing her law degree at Dalhousie University in 1918. On September 10, 1918 she was the first woman called to the bar in Nova Scotia. At the time, women were not considered to be \"persons\" under the law. Although she lived in Winnipeg, Ottawa and Toronto, she returned to Newcastle following her father's death in 1933. She was among the first six female lawyers in the province. She ran as the Reconstruction Party candidate for the Northumberland riding in the 1935 federal election, but was defeated by Liberal John Patrick Barry. She also ran as an unsuccessful Conservative Party candidate in the 1935 New Brunswick provincial election. In 1947 she was named New Brunswick's first female deputy county magistrate, and was appointed a Q.C. in 1972.

  "text" : "Francis Xavier Schwab (1874–1946) was Mayor of the City of Buffalo, New York, serving 1922–1929. He was born on Smith Street on the Buffalo's East Side on August 14, 1874. At 19, he became a foreman at the Pullman Palace Car Company, then known as the Wagner Palace Car Company, and took a job as a traveling salesman for the company. He then became a brewery solicitor, eventually becoming the highest paid brewery solicitor in Buffalo. He married Theresa M. Lauser on September 24, 1901. He opened a wholesale and retail liquor store at Broadway and Jefferson Avenue in 1912. He became president and general manager of the Mohawk Products Company; the merged Buffalo Brewing Company and the Cooperative Brewing Company formed during Prohibition to make near-beer. Schwab's rise in the Buffalo brewing industry was short lived because of the enactment of prohibition in 1919. Even though Schwab transitioned into the production of near beer he would take the opportunity to speak out against the Volstead Act whenever possible. \"By this time, Frank Schwab had developed a personal style that delighted his friends and infuriated his enemies\". The Buffalo Brewing company, Schwab's brewery, was raided by Federal agents who found illegal beer resulting in an indictment for Schwab. Schwab was an unlikely candidate for mayor. He had no political experience, he was Catholic, and under federal indictment for illegal possession of alcohol. But in 1921, as a joke the Knights of St. John circulated a petition on behalf of Schwab for his mayoral candidacy. He was elected Mayor on November 8, 1921, as the Republican candidate. During his term, in the summer of 1922, the last and most bitter street railway strike occurred; Schwab declared a transportation emergency and authorized the running of buses. Finally, the International Railway Company went open shop and the union was broken. In 1923–1924, the city purchased land for an airfield and, on September 27, 1926, Mayor Schwab laid the cornerstone of the administration building for the Buffalo Airport. Schwab was easily re-elected to a second term on November 4, 1925. He lost his bid for re-election on November 5, 1929, with Charles Roesch elected mayor. Schwab returned to active management of Mohawk Products Company. He died on April 23, 1946, and was buried in Mt. Calvary Cemetery."

  "text" : "Frank Albert Sedita (June 20, 1907 – May 2, 1975) was Mayor of the City of Buffalo, New York, serving 1958–1961 and 1966–1973. He was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on June 20, 1907. The family moved to Buffalo in 1911, and when he was 10, Sedita began work by hawking newspapers and shining shoes around the downtown area. He attended Hutchinson Central High School and spent his summers working in canning factories and on farms in Wilson and Lyndonville, New York. He received a B.A. from Canisius College, and in 1931 received his law degree from the University of Buffalo Law School. He married Sarah Vacanti on July 11, 1934. In 1950, Sedita was elected as a City Court judge. He resigned from his job on the City Court bench on September 6, 1957 to pursue his mayoral bid. On November 5, 1957, he was elected mayor, defeating incumbent Steven Pankow. During this term, urban renewal was continued and the Ellicott District Project was completed. He lost his bid for re-election to mayor in the November 7, 1961 election, when Chester A. Kowal was elected mayor. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy nominated Sedita to the post of Federal Customs Collector for the Port of Buffalo; he held that post until May 7, 1965. He was elected as mayor to a second term on November 2, 1965. At the 1966 Democratic State Convention, held in Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, he was nominated to run for New York State Attorney General. He was defeated in the general election by Louis Lefkowitz. In June 1967, during the Buffalo riot at the Michigan Avenue YMCA, the mayor faced an angry crowd of young African Americans during an East Side street confrontation. He was re-elected on November 4, 1969. He ran for Erie County executive in 1971, but was defeated by Edward V. Regan in the general election. Because of health concerns, on February 8, 1973 Sedita submitted a letter of resignation to the Buffalo Common Council, to become effective on March 5, 1973. He died on May 2, 1975, aged 67, and was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery. On December 14, 1987, Buffalo Public School 38 was renamed Frank A. Sedita Community School. Sedita's son, Frank A. Sedita, Jr., was a judge on the New York State Supreme Court, and his grandson, Frank A. Sedita III, is a judge on the New York State Supreme Court"

He had worked as a sand farmer, in the stone quarries of Red Granite, as a tannery worker, on the railroads, and in many factories. He had been a member of the Longshoreman's Union, the Furniture Workers, Railway Clerks, and Paper, Pulp and Sufite Workers Union. Blair attended the University of Wisconsin as a Zona Gale scholar. Becoming active in left wing politics, he joined the Communist Party USA in 1929 running for governor in 1930, 1932, 1940, 1942, 1966, and 1974. He also ran for U.S. Senator for Wisconsin in the 1938 election. Blair survived multiple investigations into his activities in the 1940s and 50s and remained as the head of the Communist Party of Wisconsin well into the 1970s. In the Governor's race in 1974, he received 3,617 votes. Blair and his wife Mary ran \"Mary's Bookshop\" in Milwaukee for 13 years; Blair was well known for his poetry and love of literature. In November 1966, there was an attempt on Blair's life when a 17-year-old Brookfield Wisconsin youth entered Mary's Bookshop and tried to shoot Blair with a handgun. Blair was not wounded although a customer in the store was shot during a scuffle with the assailant."

He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Evesham at a by-election in July 1880, by a majority of only two votes. A petition was lodged and the result voided. Scrutiny of the votes led to his opponent Frederick Dixon-Hartland being declared the winner in January 1881, with a majority of one vote. Lehmann married Nina Chambers, daughter of Dr Robert Chambers of Edinburgh. Their social circle included Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Robert Browning, Lord Leighton, and other prominent figures. Their sons were Rudolf Chambers Lehmann (a Liberal politician), Frederick Hope Lehmann and Ernest Benzon Lehmann. They had one daughter, Nina Frederika Mary Teba Lehmann, who married Sir Guy Theophilus Campbell. His son Frederick had an affair with the actress Minnie Duncan (whose sister was much better known as an actress - Emily Mary Duncan) Their two sons Frederic Archibald Duncan (1884) and John (Jack) Lehmann Duncan (1886) may not have known the identity of their father (who signed the register for their baptisms as 'Frederic Duncan, Gentleman' . Minnie lived in a large house with servants in London - and the census noted her as 'Minnie Lehmann' - single. Minnie married Lt Col Hugh Charles Fortescue in 1892. Lehmann died at the age of 65."

  "text" : "Frank Flannery is a political consultant and Fine Gael's former Director of Organisations and Strategy. He is currently under investigation (2016) for offshore accounts as he was exposed in the Panama Papers. Born and raised in Kiltullagh in County Galway, he studied at University College Galway, where he joined Fine Gael. He served as President of the Union of Students in Ireland between 1971 and 1972. After he finished his degree, he worked for The Rehab Group, a non-governmental organisation, involved with providing care and education for people with disabilities. He became Chief Executive Officer of the group in 1981. He retired from the position in 2006. Originally working as an activist within Fine Gael, he became one of Garret FitzGerald's handlers and chief strategists during the three elections between 1981 and 1982. In the aftermath of the 2002 general election, which was a disastrous election for Fine Gael, he authored the Flannery Report which proposed a series of changes in the organisation and structure of the party. In 2002 he was made Fine Gael's director of Organisation and Strategy and was charged with implementing the report. The restructuring bore fruit for Fine Gael in the 2004 local elections and the 2007 general election, both of which saw gains for Fine Gael. He served as National Director of Elections for Fine Gael in the 2009 local elections, which resulted in the party becoming the largest party of local government for the first time in its history. In June 2009 in the run up to the European and local elections, he caused controversy when he stated that Fine Gael would be willing to take part in a coalition government which would include Sinn Féin in order put Fianna Fáil out of government, a comment which was criticised within the party and led to his temporary demotion by party leader Enda Kenny. In March 2014, Flannery confirmed his departure from his role as director of elections with Fine Gael, amid the fallout from the controversy about salaries at the Rehab Group in which he was a director before also leaving this role.At the height of the Rehab controversy it emerged that he had received payments of more than €409,000 from Rehab for consultancy work which included political lobbying on their behalf when he was a part of Fine Gael hierarchy. He declined to appear before the Public Accounts Committee to discuss the payments. His name also appeared in the Panama Papers as having used the services of an offshore law office."

Deane worked as a farm labourer in Minnesota and the Canadian prairies before coming to British Columbia in 1889. He worked for the Nanaimo Free Press and the Victoria Province  before becoming editor and managing director of the Kamloops Inland Sentinel. He was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1900. In 1902, Deane purchased the Nelson Daily Miner, later renamed the Daily News. In 1894, Canadian Pacific (CP) had acquired the Canadian rights to the Associated Press wire service. Existing news report services which included Canadian news were discontinued and the new service was offered at a higher price. This led to the creation of the Western Associated Press, based in Winnipeg. However, newspapers further west were limited by CP's control of telegraph services. Deane complained in print about the unreliability and high price of CP's wire service. CP threatened to discontinue service if the complaints continue. Finally, in October 1907, following an appeal to Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier by a group of publishers of newspapers in Western Canada including Deane, a compromise was reached. In 1908, he sold the Nelson newspaper and became owner and managing editor of the weekly Cranbrook Herald. Deane died of heart failure in New Westminster at the age of 45."

Upon his death, the Oakland City Council voted unanimously to rename City Hall Plaza in his honor as the Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. The plaza displays a bronze bust of Ogawa. A Nisei, Ogawa was born in Lodi, California and never lived in Japan. Nevertheless, as Japanese Americans, the U.S. government involuntarily relocated Ogawa's family members to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Millard County, Utah and they were detained there for the duration of World War II. Ogawa married Grace Ogawa (née Hiruma) prior to their wartime detention and they had two children—Alan and Nancy. Nancy was born in the Topaz War Relocation Center but died at age 2. After the war, Ogawa returned to Oakland where he found work as a gardener. Eventually, he borrowed and saved enough money to open his own nursery. When Ogawa died, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, in her Tribute to Frank H. Ogawa, said: \"Frank Ogawa was a remarkable person because he could take personal misfortune and turn it into a positive learning experience for himself and others. When Frank and Grace Ogawa were forced to sell their belongings and live in internment camps during World War II, they had to sleep on straw mattresses in horse stalls for six months before beingshipped to a camp in Utah to spend another 3 1/2 years in confinement. Despite this mistreatment and injustice, he never lost faith in the United States. Just the opposite--he strived to prove his loyalty to his country and became an internationally recognized champion of Asian-Americans in the process.\" She went on to say \"Having served five years on the Oakland Parks Commission, Frank Ogawa was elected to the city council in 1966, making him the first Japanese-American to hold a council seat in a major city in the continental United States. He held that position for 28 years until his passing -- the longest tenure in Oakland's history.\" Ogawa was a member of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) from 1972 to 1988, having been appointed to the Commission by the Association of Bay Area Governments. Ogawa served on the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Board of Directors from 1979 until 1992 when he had to retire from the Board because of health issues. He served as Chairman of the Board during most of 1987 and served as Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board's Executive Committee and Personnel Committee. Ogawa was a Republican. However, he never held nor was he ever a candidate for any partisan office. As a public official, Ogawa was known as kind, optimistic, and adept at building consensus. In about December 1988, Ogawa underwent successful heart surgery. Ogawa died in Oakland on July 13, 1994, of lung cancer. He was survived by his wife Grace, son Alan, and by two grandchildren, Courtney and Matthew. More than 600 people, including a representative of Oakland's sister city of Fukuoka, Japan, attended Ogawa's memorial service."

  "text" : "Frank William Green (March 15, 1876 – December 24, 1953) was a Canadian physician and politician. Green was born in Victoria, British Columbia in 1876 to Alexander Alfred Green and Theophila Turner Raines. He attended Corrig College at Victoria. After the death of his father in 1891, Green relocated to Montreal to attend McGill University where he would obtain his medical degree.Upon his graduation from McGill in 1898, Green worked as a physician on the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway Crowsnest Pass line, in the Kootenay Valley, working on horseback. During the time he operated a hospital and treated many during an epidemic of typhoid. He later settled at Cranbrook, British Columbia, in the Kootenay Valley in 1899 to establish a medical practice. He was one of the first and only physicians, a medical pioneer at Cranbrook. A partnership with Dr. James Horace King of Cranbrook which started in 1903 was described as a \"cornerstone in local medicine\", with modern innovations being in use at the time, two examples being the first x-ray machine in the city being purchased for their hospital and the use of automobiles within the practice. In the British Columbia general election, 1941, Green was elected as a Conservative to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for the district of Cranbrook. He was elected again in 1945 as a coalition member, serving until his retirement in 1949. He married Lillian Barbara Staples of Stillwater, Minnesota in June 1905. One of his sons, William Otis Green also became a doctor in the Cranbrook area, with whom he later shared a practice with. Frank W. Green died in 1953 of heart problems at St. Eugene Hospital in Cranbrook, which he had established. He was later cremated in Calgary. His wife Lillian died on October 22, 1965 at Cranbrook. The F. W. Green Medical Centre and F. W. Green Memorial Home continuing care centre at Cranbrook are both named after him."

He also served as the fourth mayor of Fort Pierce, Florida from 1905 to 1907. He was born in Niles, Ohio, the son of Dr. William Miller Fee. In 1872, he married Margaret Irwin while living in Franklin, Pennsylvania. They had two sons, William and Fred. Fred would also serve as mayor of Fort Pierce like his father. His father, Dr. William Fee moved to Melbourne in 1884, and Frank Fee moved to Melbourne from Franklin, in 1887. He opened a hardware store and mortuary named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Charles H. Stewart, who had also served as mayor. Fee was in the hardware business in Pennsylvania. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. He served as city alderman in Fort Pierce from 1904 to 1905, and as mayor from 1905 to 1907. Fee apparently had advanced views for his times. He opposed the death penalty and he supported compulsory education."

  "text" : "Frank Trevor Blevins (3 June 1939 – 7 September 2013) was an Australian politician and 6th Deputy Premier of South Australia from 1992 to 1993 for the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party. Blevins served in both the Legislative Council and House of Assembly. He was a minister in a number of portfolios. In 1983 in a dispute about the use of volunteers in the ambulance service, as minister for Health, he publicly sided with the St. John Council who managed the ambulance service and two unions, the Ambulance Employees Association and the Miscellaneous Workers Association. John Cornwall, reflects that this position probably damaged his credibility at the time, with both unions and the Labor Party. Blevins was Treasurer of South Australia from 1992 to 1993. Prior to entering parliament he was a British merchant seaman and then a merchant seaman at Whyalla. He died at his home in 2013."

The business was located at the southeast corner of Main Street and East 2nd Streets. He was born in Earlville, Illinois in September 1855, the son of William Williams and Rachel Davis. He came to California in 1876, and worked on a farm in Marysville. He came to Chico in 1878. He partnered with Charles Fetters and opened Fetters and Williams. In 1906, Williams bought out Mr. Fetters and continued the business under the same name. Williams was also interested in horticulture, and owned several orchards of almonds and prunes on his ranch near Lone Pine Avenue. He was the first person in Butte County to operate apiaries. His operation grew to six apiaries containing nearly eight hundred colonies of bees, becoming the largest exporter of honey in the area."

He represented the electoral district of Kings West in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1971 to 1978. He was a member of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party. Bezanson was born in Westville, Nova Scotia and was educated there. He was an insurance agent. In 1948, he married Wanda Alice Banks. Bezanson made his first attempt at entering provincial politics in the 1967 election, but lost to Progressive Conservative Gordon Tidman by 97 votes. He ran again in the 1970 election, with Tidman winning the seat on election night by 16 votes. However a recount resulted in a tie with both Bezanson and Tidman receiving 3735 votes. The returning officer cast the deciding vote for Tidman, declaring him the winner. The Liberals appealed the result and a judge declared the vote null and void and ordered a by-election. On November 16, 1971, Bezanson won the by-election, defeating Progressive Conservative Fred Chisholm by 323 votes. Bezanson was re-elected in the 1974 election. He was defeated by Progressive Conservative George Moody when he ran for re-election in the 1978 election. He died in Toronto, Ontario on November 10, 1993."
