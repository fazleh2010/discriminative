He was among the NLD representatives who boycotted the National Convention in December 1995 and is a former BSPP Deputy Prime Minister and member of the BSPP State Council.He completed high school in Rangoon before World War II and served in the Burma Independence Army (BIA), Burma Defence Army (BDA) and with the Patriotic Burmese Force (PBF) from 1942-1945. He completed BDA officer training at the Japanese Royal Military Academy and from 1952-1954 studied at the British Royal Military Academy. He was also the Military Attaché to the USA. U Lwin was put under de facto house arrest on 22 September 2000 and released on 1 December 2000.[ Member of CRPP, Chairperson of Committee for Health and Social Affairs ] U Lwin received 18,189 valid votes or 68 % in the 1990 elections.{ The only original member of the executive committee, who was left after 1990 to help U Aung Shwe in his struggle to keep the NLD intact through the years that threatened its viability as a political party, was U Lwin, the treasurer. U Lwin had joined the Burmese Independence Army as an 18-year-old boy at the outbreak of the war. In August 1943 he was among a batch of Burmese cadets chosen to go to Japan for training at the Rikugun Shikan Gakko (army academy). By the time the young Burmese officers had completed their training in April 1945, the anti-fascist resistance movement had started and U Lwin and his fellow graduates of the military academy remained in Hakone until October 1945, making charcoal which they sold to buy food. U Lwin continued with his career in the army after independence and was sent on training courses to England and West Germany. In 1959 he was sent to Washington as military attache. On his return from the United States he spent some years as deputy commander of Central Command, then commander of South Eastern Command before he was asked to come back to Rangoon to become a deputy minister. As the military government that assumed power in 1962 took on a civilian garb under the Burmese Socialist Programme Party, U Lwin served successively as minister of finance, deputy prime minister and a member of the state council. It was as a member of the state council that he resigned in 1980. U Lwin joined the NLD in 1988 and was appointed treasurer because of his experience in finances and his unquestioned integrity. In 1992, when the NLD was forced to reorganize its executive committee, U Lwin took on the post of secretary, while U Aung Shwe became chairman. He died of natural causes at his home in Yangon's Bahan Township on 7 December 2011. He was subsequently cremated at the Yayway Cemetery."

He joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in the early 1960s, and was selected to stand for the party at the Glasgow Pollok by-election, 1967. During the by-election one observer described his speeches as being in the style of Jimmy Maxton. His campaign also featured the singing of both traditional and topical Scottish songs. Although the party had never previously contested the seat, Leslie took 28% of the vote. The Labour Party share of the vote dropped considerably, enabling the Conservative Party to win - their last by-election gain of the century in Scotland. Leslie's campaign marked the start of a year of successes for the SNP, including becoming the largest party in local government in Stirling, and victory in the Hamilton by-election. Leslie was soon elected to the Glasgow Corporation, and, in 1969, became the SNP's Senior Vice-Chairman. Later, he served as a Strathclyde Regional councillor forEast Kilbride, and he stood as the SNP candidate for Glasgow at the European Parliament election in 1979, taking 16.4% of the vote. During the early 1980s, Leslie was the SNP's Vice-Chairman for Policy. He was the party's candidate in the high-profile Glasgow Hillhead by-election in 1982 but, despite campaigning hard, he was only able to take fourth place, with 11.3% of the votes cast. He stood again in Hillhead at the 1983 general election, but fell to only 5.4% of the vote, He stood in Strathclyde East at the 1984 European election, taking second place with 17.6% of the vote, then in Kilmarnock and Loudoun in the 1987 general election, taking third place but 18.2%. Standing again in Strathclyde East at the 1989 European election, he increased his share to 25.2%, and finally at the 1992 general election he took 15.6% and fourth place in Glasgow Pollok. On 28 February 2010, Leslie formally launched a campaign to contest Kilmarnock and Loudoun at the 2010 general election. However, he finished in second place, 12,378 votes behind the Labour Party candidate Cathy Jamieson. Leslie currently remains an active member of the SNP in the Kilmarnock & Loudoun area."
