Carrington was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; he enlisted in the United States Army in 1953 and served as a paratrooper during the Korean War until 1955. Following his military service, he completed his high school education in 1957 and earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Widener College in 1962. Professionally, Carrington rose to become CEO of the Sirchie Group, a company specializing in evidence-collection gear for police and top-dollar security products for businesses. He was first elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1995. In 2005, Carrington was charged with illegally exporting evidence-collection gear to China and took a plea bargain in December 2005 to felony charges in which he has been fined $850,000. One of his companies also took a plea agreement in the matter. The law was altered to allow such exports a few years later. Many large companies have had to make files to track their resold goods to avoid penalty. The charge was for rape kits, finger print imaging kits, finger printing powder kits, and other evidence collecting products, etc. The effects were not sold directly to China, but were resold without the explicit knowledge of Carrington. Paper handling and documentation were handled badly by Carrington. However, under the law this circumstance was not an exception and a guilty plea was submitted."

  "text" : "William Green T'Vault (1806–1869) was a pioneer of the Oregon Country and the first editor of the first newspaper published west of the Missouri River. T'Vault led a wagon train of 300 that arrived in Oregon in 1845, after traveling on the Meek Cutoff, a branch of the Oregon Trail. He settled in Oregon City, and was appointed Postmaster General by the Provisional Government of Oregon. T'Vault became president of the Oregon Printing Association, which was an outgrowth of the Oregon Lyceum, and published the first issue of the Oregon Spectator on February 5, 1846. He was fired from the Spectator after 13 issues. T'Vault claimed it was because of differences with other association members, especially George Abernethy, though the association claimed it because of T'Vault's poor spelling. T'Vault was a pro-slavery Democrat who became a member of the Provisional Legislature of Oregon in 1846. The same year he was part of a group that urged the United States Congress to disallow the land claims of earlier White residents of the region, including that of John McLoughlin at Willamette Falls. The petition was partially successful and McLoughlin's claim was not recognized. In 1851, T'Vault led an exploring party of ten people from Port Orford in order to seek an overland route to the interior of the region. The party was ambushed by Native Americans and five members were killed, but T'Vault survived. He moved to southern Oregon and established the Table Rock Sentinel newspaper in 1855, and later the Oregon Sentinel in 1858. T'Vault represented Jackson County in the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1858, its final year, and served as speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives during its first session, in 1858-59. He advocated for the formation of an independent Pacific Republic and also practiced law in Jacksonville."

He holds the title of Florida's longest-serving state legislator. He earned the nickname \"Banty Rooster\" – after the diminutive, swaggering barnyard fowl – and became known for his eccentric mannerisms and colorful, folksy expressions. Childers was popular in his district for the ample state funding and \"turkey\" projects he sent home, including $12.5 million for the Pensacola Civic Center and the I-110 extension to Gregory Street. Initially a Democrat, he switched to the Republican Party in 1995. After term limits forced him from the Florida Senate in 2000, Childers ran for the District 1 seat of the Escambia County Commission. He became embroiled in the soccer complex corruption scandal and was found guilty of violating the Florida Sunshine Law and of bribing Commissioner Willie Junior to help push the purchases of two properties, totaling $6.2 million, from Childers' associates Joe and Georgann Elliott. Childers served nearly three years of a 42-month prison sentence in West Palm Beach and was released on 17 June 2009, after which he relocated away from Pensacola. On 8 June 2010, a federal appeals court overturned the bribery conviction, ruling that Childers' constitutional right to confront his accuser had been violated, as the defense team was not allowed to question Junior on his change of testimony."

  "text" : "William Dyer (also Dyre) (1609–by 1677) was an early settler of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, a founding settler of both Portsmouth and Newport, and Rhode Island's first Attorney General. He is best known for being the husband of the Quaker martyr, Mary Dyer, who was executed for her Quaker activism. Sailing from England as a young man with his wife, Dyer first settled in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but like many members of the Boston church became a supporter of the dissident ministers John Wheelwright and Anne Hutchinson during the Antinomian Controversy, and signed a petition in support of Wheelwright. For doing this, he was disenfranchised and disarmed, and with many other supporters of Hutchinson, he signed the Portsmouth Compact, and settled on Aquidneck Island in the Narragansett Bay. Within a year of arriving there, he and others followed William Coddington to the south end of the island where they established the town of Newport. Once in Newport, Dyer was very active in civil affairs, holding a number of offices, particularly those using his clerical skills such as clerk and secretary. The political alignment of the island towns of Portsmouth and Newport was in flux for the first decade of government there, and Coddington had gone to England to obtain a commission to keep the island independent with him as governor. By 1651 Dyer and others had greatly tired of Coddington's rule, and he was one of three men who went to England to have Coddington's commission revoked. Being successful, Dyer returned with the news in 1653, but his wife, Mary, who had been there at the same time, remained in England. Mary returned from England in 1657 after being there for five years, and had become a zealous Quaker convert. Banned from Massachusetts, she nevertheless defied the authorities and returned in 1659, being sentenced to hang, but getting a stay of execution while on the gallows. Her last trip to Boston in 1660 resulted in her execution and martyrdom. Following Mary's death, Dyer remarried, and continued his public service, while having some legal entanglements with William Coddington. He was dead by late 1677, though no record for his death has been found."

  "text" : "Charles Wainman Burson was a legal counsel and Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States under Al Gore. He assumed the position of legal counsel from Kumiki Gibson in February 1997 after serving almost a decade as Tennessee Attorney General. In 1999 Charles Burson became Gore's Chief of Staff, replacing Ron Klain who resigned in August of that year. Burson is the son of Josie Burson and Leo Burson. He grew up in Shelby County, Tennessee, where he graduated from Central High School in Memphis in 1962. Burson received his Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of Michigan, his Master of Arts from the University of Cambridge, and his J.D. from Harvard Law School. Burson was a friend of Gore for over three decades at the time of his appointment as Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States. Charles Burson first became friends with the future Vice President in 1968 during the time Gore was studying Tennessee history at Memphis State University. In 1984 he was the chairman of Gore's senatorial campaign. This continued a family tradition of involvement with the Gores. Burson's parents were active in Tennessee Democratic politics, and his mother had held a position in Albert Gore Sr.'s senatorial campaign in 1958. Before joining the White House, Charles Burson held a variety of public and private roles. From 1970 until 1988, he worked in private practice as a lawyer. He briefly flirted with active politics in the 1978 when he lost a race to Republican Ed Williams for the East Memphis seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. In 1988 he was appointed the Tennessee Attorney General. In this capacity, Burson served on a number of public legal bodies. He was a member of the Tennessee Board of Law Examiners, of the Tennessee Code Commission and of the Commission on the Future of the Judicial System. Burson also represented the state several times before the Supreme Court of the United States. One notable case he argued was Burson v. Freeman, which established a state's ability to regulate election advertising on voting day. After his time in the White House, Burson served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the global agribusiness corporation, Monsanto. Burson is married to Bunny Burson and has two daughters, Clare and Kate. He presently resides in St. Louis, Missouri, teaches at the Washington University School of Law and is of counsel to the St. Louis law firm Bryan Cave."

The shift, however, left Democrats with an 18-12 majority, allowing them to pass increases to taxes and fees without Republican support. (A 1996 law requires a 3/5 supermajority in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly for such measures.) Telfer has lived in Bend since 1977. She has two daughters. She earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Denver, and did post-graduate work at Franklin University and the University of Oregon. She has taught at Central Oregon Community College and served as vice-chair on the Bend Development Board. In 2010, Telfer filed for the special election for Oregon State Treasurer, to complete the term of Ben Westlund, who died in office, but lost to Democratic incumbent Ted Wheeler in the November general election. In the Republican primary of the 2012 legislative elections, Telfer was defeated by Tim Knopp, a former state Representative and vice president of the Central Oregon Builders Association. She became the Oregon Lottery Commissioner. In 2016, she is running for the nomination of the Independent Party of Oregon's nomination for Treasurer of Oregon. She is expected to be that party's first nominee for a statewide office."

Among his other land purchases, he patented a tract in Chuckatuck parish in 1668. This farm was expressly included in Nansemond County when the Assembly drew its boundary with Isle of Wight County in 1674. In March 1676 he was identified as colonel of the Nansemond militia when he was authorized to raise a force to fight Indians. Godwin was not a member of the General Assembly of 1661–76. When it was dissolved and a new Assembly met in June 1676, he was elected Speaker of the House. This Assembly, which met just before the outbreak of Bacon's Rebellion, had all its acts annulled by the Assembly that met the following year, although a number of them were reenacted by that same session. Godwin's will was dated March 24, 1677 (old style). He named three children as heirs."

He won the May 8 Republican primary, which was tantamount to election, since no Democrat filed for the seat. Meanwhile, Brawley was also in 2012 named to lead the North Carolina chapter of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. In April 2013, Brawley filed House Bill 640 that would allow lobbyists to give unreported gifts to state lawmakers in North Carolina. In May 2013, Brawley resigned as chairman of the House Finance Committee in a dispute with House Speaker Thom Tillis. Brawley lost his bid for another term in the May 2014 Republican primary, with some of his colleagues in the House campaigning against him. Afterwards, the House Republican Caucus passed a vote of \"no confidence\" in Brawley, effectively barring him from caucus meetings. Brawley suggested that the censure was in retaliation for his criticism of Tillis. On December 9, 2015, Brawley announced his candidacy for the office of Governor of North Carolina, challenging current governor Pat McCrory."

Wynne was born in Canterbury, England, being baptized there on December 22, 1622. His grandfather, also Robert Wynne, had been mayor of Canterbury in 1599, and other relatives had served in Parliament. He settled in Charles City County, Virginia in early 1656, though he may have arrived in Virginia earlier. He served on the county court, though he was fined for poor attendance in September 1659. He also did not serve as a burgess in that year's assembly, though he did the years before and after. The House of Burgesses called by Sir William Berkeley in 1661 continued without dissolving until 1676, meeting in seventeen sessions during that period. At the second session in 1662, Wynne was elected as Speaker to replace Henry Soane, who had died during the recess. Under Wynne's leadership, the House took an active role in business previously left to the Governor and Council, creating a standing committee to advise the Governor between sessions. Wynne died in 1675; his will was dated July 1."

Wahl died on July 22, 2013 at the age of 88. Supreme Court Chief Justice Lorie Gildea issued a statement on the death of former Justice Wahl: \"Rosalie Wahl was a trailblazer for our state, both as a lawyer and as the first woman to serve on the Minnesota Supreme Court. While on the court she led efforts to address both gender fairness and racial bias in our state’s justice system. She will be remembered with fondness and respect for her unwavering commitment to the principle of equal justice for all.\" In an interview with Peter Shea done in 2003 she talks about her post-retirement role as a \"public citizen,\" including her work as a peace activist. Wahl also served as an adjunct professor at William Mitchell College of Law and the University of Minnesota Law School. There is a book about Wahl, titled Her Honor: Rosalie Wahl and the Minnesota Women's Movement, which was published in 2014."

Seeking a political comeback, Quary supported Seth Sothel's takeover of the Governor's office in 1690, and was appointed Chief Justice. In 1692, Sothel was forced from office, and Quary fled South Carolina for Philadelphia, where he came under the protection of Maryland Gov. Francis Nicholson. The Navigation Act of 1696 created admiralty courts, and Quary was appointed Judge of the Admiralty for the southern colonies, from Pennsylvania southward. In 1701, Robert Quary was commissioned as Surveyor General of the Customs for New Jersey and Pennsylvania; in 1703 this appointment was expanded to include all of British America. In this position he served simultaneously on the Provincial Councils of five colonies: Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Robert Quary died in Virginia in October 1712."

Andrews earned a bachelor's degree from UMass Amherst and an MBA from Xavier University before embarking on a 25-year career with Procter & Gamble (P&G).

She left P&G in 2006 after four years as the company's global diversity & inclusion manager. She then established her own consulting business, Legacy Unlimited. Following incumbent state representative Chris Donelan's announcement that he would run for Franklin County sheriff rather than seek re-election in 2010, Andrews launched a bid to succeed him in the state house. In the Democratic primary election held on September 14, 2010, Andrews polled 37% in a five candidate race, finishing 519 votes ahead of the second-place finisher, who took 24%. In the general election held on November 2, she polled 6,885 (53%), finishing over 1,300 votes ahead of the Republican nominee (who took 42%) and an independent (on 5%). She first took office on January 5, 2011. She was defeated for re-election by Republican Susannah Whipps Lee in November 2014; her term will end January 7, 2015."

  "text" : "Jones, known by his nickname of \"Denny,\" was born September 21, 1910 in rural Morrow County, Oregon in a house on a wheat farm located between the towns of Ione and Heppner. His family moved briefly to the state of Montana before returning to Wheeler County in Eastern Oregon, where Jones attended public school in the small town of Spray. Jones' mother died when he was just 5 years old. Following his mother's death, his father moved the family to Crook County, where Jones attended school at Prineville. He completed two years of school at Crook County High School before being pulled out by his father, who had designs on making his diminutive son into a professional racing jockey. Jones spent over a year riding horses throughout British Columbia, Canada and in Tijuana, Mexico before he began to gain too much weight, making a further career in horse racing impossible. Jones returned to rural Malheur County, Oregon where he took a job on a cattle ranch. He would remain a ranch hand and rancher for the rest of his working life. In 1939, Jones went into a business partnership with a cousin who owned two cattle ranches, one near the small Oregon town of Jonesboro and the other in close proximity to Juntura. Jones managed the Jonesburo operation for the next ten years before ultimately buying the operation, on which he ran 400 head of cattle. Jones' ranch would ultimately grow to 550 head of cattle contained on 23,000 acres of high desert rangeland. Jones ran the ranch for the next 30 years, serving twice during this time as president of the Oregon Cattlemen's Association (OCA). In this capacity Jones gained his first legislative experience engaging in political lobbying on behalf of the interests of the OCA."
