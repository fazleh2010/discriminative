  "text" : "(This is a Malay name; the name Aziz is a patronymic, not a family name, and the person should be referred to by the given name, Othman.) Dato' Othman bin Aziz (born 15 May 1959) is a Malaysian politician. He is the member of the Parliament of Malaysia for the seat of Jerlun, Kedah, having been elected in 2013. He previously served one term in the Kedah State Legislative Assembly (2004–2008) and was the chairman of the Kedah Tourism Action Council. He is a member of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition. Othman was born in Alor Setar, Kedah. He received his primary education at the Sekolah Kebangsaan Ayer Hitam, Kedah. He continued his secondary education in Kolej Sultan Abdul Hamid and later went to University Technology MARA to study a Diploma in Business Administration. After completing his diploma he went to the National University of Malaysia and graduated with Bachelor of Marketing Studies. He subsequently held a number of positions in corporate enterprises. In the 2004 general election, Othman was elected to the state assembly of Kedah, defeating the incumbent Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) assemblyman Abdul Ghani Ahmad by 860 votes in the seat of Ayer Hitam. In 2005 he was appointed to the Executive Council of the Kedah state government by the incoming Chief Minister Mahdzir Khalid. During this time he also managed the Kedah Football Association. He was a casualty of the Barisan Nasional state government's defeat in the 2008 election, as he lost his seat by 506 votes to his predecessor, Abdul Ghani. In the 2013 election, Othman ran for the UMNO-held federal seat of Jerlun. Jerlun was being vacated by Mukhriz Mahathir, who was seeking to move to state politics to become Kedah's Chief Minister. Othman defeated PAS's Ismail Salleh by 3,270 votes, winning election to the federal parliament."

He is a member of the United Malays National Organisation in Malaysia's ruling Barisan Nasional coalition. Ahmad Razif, the son of a religious teacher, was raised in Terengganu. He graduated from Universiti Putra Malaysia with a Masters in Science and rose through the ranks of his local UMNO division. In 2008 he was elected to the Terengganu State Legislative Assembly for the seat of Seberang Takir, defeating a People's Justice Party (PKR) candidate. The State's incoming Chief Minister Ahmad Said appointed him to the State's Executive Council—akin to a cabinet—with responsibility for education, higher education, science, technology and human resources. Ahmad Razif retained his assembly seat at the 2013 election. However, the Barisan Nasional state government almost lost its majority in the assembly, clinging to power with a slim 17–15 majority. In response, the coalition's national leader, and the Prime Minister, Najib Razak, pressured Ahmad Said to resign within a year. In May 2014, Ahmad Said stood down and Ahmad Razif was appointed as his replacement. He was sworn in to office by Mizan Zainal Abidin, the Sultan of Terengganu, on 13 May. Ahmad Razif's first task as Chief Minister was to navigate a political crisis when Ahmad Said and two other UMNO assemblymen resigned from UMNO immediately after his appointment, potentially plunging his government into minority status. Ahmad Said stated that he was dissatisfied that he had not been allowed to remain as Chief Minister until after the wedding of his daughter in May 2014. The three assemblymen returned to the party within days, after the intervention of Najib and other senior Barisan Nasional leaders. On 22 April 2016, his 'Datuk Seri' title had been revoked by the Sultan."
