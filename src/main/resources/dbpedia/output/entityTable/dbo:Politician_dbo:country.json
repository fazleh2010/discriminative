Before his by-election success he served as a Labour councillor on the Denton Urban District Council, representing Denton West. Although reselected to fight Manchester Gorton at the 1983 general election, boundary changes substantially altered the constituency boundaries, with the largest part of the constituency, Denton and Audenshaw in Tameside Metropolitan Borough, merging with Reddish in Stockport Metropolitan Borough to form a new Denton and Reddish constituency. Gorton was included with much of the former Manchester Ardwick constituency, which was renamed Manchester Gorton. As there were potentially three Labour MPs contesting two new seats, Marks, who was the senior of the three, stood down, allowing Stockport North's Andrew Bennett to inherit Denton and Reddish and Gerald Kaufman to move across from Ardwick to the new Gorton seat."

Scott Walker in 2011 as Deputy Secretary of the Department of Health Services. Following the resignation of Dennis Smith, she was appointed Secretary.

In his last term he served as one of the chairmen of the House Appropriations committee (and the only Democrat to be a chairman in the Republican-majority House). Crawford earned a degree in Industrial Relations from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After serving in the United States Navy and as an Oxford city commissioner, Crawford was first elected to the legislature in 1982. He considered a run for Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina in 1988, but dropped out and was re-elected to the House. In 1992, he ran for Lt. Governor, losing in the Democratic primary to Dennis Wicker. Crawford's seat in the House was won by Richard H. Moore. When Moore ran for Congress in 1994, Crawford won the seat back. He was re-elected without opposition in 2006. In 2008 and in 2010, he was opposed by Libertarian Barbara Howe. In 2012, after supporting the budget passed by the House Republican majority and after supporting the bill that put North Carolina Amendment 1 before the voters, Crawford was defeated in the May 8 Democratic primary by fellow Rep. Winkie Wilkins. The Republican majority had placed both Democratic lawmakers in the new 2nd District during redistricting. Crawford endorsed Republican Pat McCrory in the subsequent general election for Governor. McCrory later appointed Crawford to the state Board of Transportation."

  "text" : "John Golding (9 March 1931 – 20 January 1999) was a Labour Party politician and Trade Union leader in the United Kingdom. He was educated at Chester City Grammar School, Keele University and the London School of Economics. After some time working in the Civil Service he took up a research job with the Post Office Engineering Union. Golding was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme at a by-election in 1969. He served in the governments of Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan, as PPS to Eric Varley as Minister of Technology, a Labour whip in opposition, and Minister for Employment. He was an outspoken opponent of Labour left-wingers such as Tony Benn and Eric Heffer, whom he regarded as idle dreamers out of touch with the working-class. Golding was a key figure in opposing the entryist Militant group, and especially in mobilising moderate trades union leaders to exercise their block votes to achieve this end. After he died, his writings were published under the title Hammer of the Left: My Part in Defeating the Labour Left by John Golding and Paul Farrelly (see below). In 1986 he left Parliament (by applying for the Chiltern Hundreds) to take up the post of General Secretary of the National Communications Union. He held this post until 1988. He had served as a member of the council of the Trades Union Congress. After he vacated the Newcastle-under-Lyme seat, the resulting by-election was won by his wife Llin, who held the seat until 2001; her successor in the seat was Paul Farrelly. John Golding's most unusual claim to fame is that he once made a speech in committee lasting eleven hours and fifteen minutes. It nominally concerned a small amendment to the bill to privatise British Telecom. This filibuster was instrumental in delaying the privatisation until after the 1983 general election, but with Margaret Thatcher obtaining a massive parliamentary majority the privatisation was soon forced through. Changes in British parliamentary procedure mean that Golding's record is unlikely ever to be beaten."

  "text" : "John Villiers Stuart Townshend, 5th Marquess Townshend (10 April 1831 – 6 October 1899), known as Viscount Raynham from 1855 to 1863, was a British peer and Liberal Member of Parliament. Townshend was the son of John Townshend, 4th Marquess Townshend, and Elizabeth Jane Crichton-Stuart. The soldier George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend, was his paternal great-grandfather, and Prime Minister John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, was his maternal great-grandfather. He was elected to the House of Commons for Tamworth in 1855 (succeeding his father), a seat he held until 1863, when he inherited the marquessate on his father's death and entered the House of Lords. At the Salisbury Petty Sessions in May 1881, Lord Edward Thynne described how he had been accosted by Lord Townshend and two accomplices on the road between Laverstock and Salisbury. A Colonel Nepean held the pony's head while Townshend struck him several times with the handle of a horse whip. Thynne acknowledged having eloped with Lady Townshend in 1872, but noted that the Marquis had never sued for divorce, and alleged that Lord Macduff had attacked him over the same matter while he was abroad. Townshend was convicted of the assault, and sentenced to a fine of £500 or three months in prison. After some hours in jail, he reluctantly paid the fine, equivalent to £45,500 in 2017. Townshend denounced the court, while Vanity Fair reported unnamed others as saying \"the only regret is that he [Thynne] was not thrashed earlier and worse\". Lord Townshend married Lady Anne Elizabeth Clementina Duff, daughter of James Duff, 5th Earl Fife, on 17 October 1865. Their children included:"

In 1971, Tilley was elected to Wandsworth Council, where he became council leader. He was selected as Labour candidate to fight Kensington in the February 1974 and October 1974 elections, with improving results but no success. The party chose him to defend at a by-election its long-standing high majority in Lambeth Central in 1978, which he won. The election was triggered by a caused by a Labour MP's death, Marcus Lipton. In Parliament, he served on Labour's opposition front bench, resigning in 1982 in opposition to the Party leadership's stand on the Falklands War. As MP for the Brixton area, he worked with Lord Scarman after the 1981 Brixton Riots for a better understanding of local social problems. He proposed a bill to amend the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 to make rape in marriage illegal in 1983. Tilley was a founding member of the Socialist Campaign Group in 1982, but his constituency seat was abolished for the 1983 election and he was selected to fight Southwark and Bermondsey instead. The seat had been safe Labour but Simon Hughes had won the constituency for the Liberal Party in a by-election earlier that year, and Hughes kept the seat in the general election. Tilley never returned to Parliament. Tilley subsequently worked as chief economic adviser to the London Borough of Hackney and 11 years as parliamentary secretary to the Co-operative Union. From 2000 to 2002, he headed the parliamentary office of the Co-operative Group. An active co-operator, he wrote Churchill's Favourite Socialist: A Life of AV Alexander, a biography of an earlier co-operative activist and Member of Parliament, created a peer for his life work, A.

  "text" : "Alfred James Wellbeloved (29 July 1926 – 10 September 2012) was a British politician. Wellbeloved was educated at South London Technical College and was a commercial and industrial correspondent. He served as a councillor on Erith Borough Council from 1956, and was the first leader of the London Borough of Bexley from 1964. Wellbeloved was elected Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Erith and Crayford at a 1965 by-election following the death of Norman Dodds, whose constituency chairman he had been. He served successively as parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Defence Minister Gerry Reynolds and Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart, and was also a junior defence minister in the Callaghan government. In 1981, he was among the Labour MPs who defected to the Social Democratic Party. At the 1983 general election, he lost his seat by just 920 votes to the Conservative David Evennett. After his defection, he was referred to as \"the inappropriately named Wellbeloved\" by then Labour leader Michael Foot. Wellbeloved subsequently rejoined the Labour Party as a member. Wellbeloved married Mavis Ratcliff in 1948. Wellbeloved died in September 2012 aged 86."

The son of John Bell, a coalminer, and his wife Margaret née Guy, Bell initially worked as a weaver in Nelson, Lancashire, in one of the town's mills. He became involved in trade union activities, leading to his sacking on three occasions. He subsequently moved to the town of Oldham, becoming secretary of the Oldham Weavers' Association in 1905, a post he held for 41 years. He was the first president of the Oldham Labour Party, and attempted to gain election to the Borough Council without success. In 1918 he was elected as member of parliament for Ormskirk, the first non Conservative to be elected for this seat since its creation in 1885. This was principally due to a divided Conservative vote between the Coalition Conservatives and the candidate of the National Farmers Union. Bell served only one term in parliament, losing his seat at the next election in 1922. He continued his union activities: in 1924 he was appointed secretary of the International Federation of Textile Workers' Associations, and was subsequently secretary of the United Textile Factory Workers Association, and in 1930 took part in a trade mission to China. He died, aged 83, in an Oldham hospital in 1955."

Like his older brother, he was a Unionist or Anti-Secessionist, until the war broke out, when he became loyal to the southern cause, serving as an officer in the Confederate military reserves. In 1870, he was elected state Senator from Randolph County. In November 1876, Worth was elected by the people to a four-year term as State Treasurer. His name added strength to the ticket and is credited with helping his fellow Democrats regain power in the State. When incumbent Republican David A. Jenkins resigned before the end of his term, Governor Curtis H. Brogden named Worth to fill the post a few months early. As Treasurer, he faced up to the difficult task of settling the State's debt on a fair and equitable basis to both the bond holders and the citizens of the State. Worth was re-elected Treasurer in 1880, serving just over four more years. He served the State well, with honor, integrity and capability and was highly respected for his service. He is quoted as once commenting upon his guiding philosophy, saying, \"My earnest wish has been to be useful to the State.\" After leaving public service, Worth became president of the Bank of Randolph and of the Southern Stock Mutual Fire Insurance Company. His Worth Manufacturing Company operated successful cotton mills in Worthville and Central Falls in Randolph County, not far from where the North Carolina Zoological Park is located today. By the time of his death in 1900 at age 90, he had become one of the State's wealthiest citizens."

  "text" : "James Williamson, 1st Baron Ashton (31 December 1842 – 27 May 1930) was a British businessman and Liberal Party politician, whose family business in Lancaster produced oilcloth and linoleum which was exported around the world. He was born the third of four surviving children to James Williamson Snr, who had established a successful coated fabrics business in the town in the 1840s. James jnr was educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School and worked all his life in the family business. With his father he created the city's Williamson Park, on the site of former stone quarries on Lancaster moor. After the death of his second wife, Jessie, who supported him in his political life, he built the Ashton Memorial on a hill in the park; the Edwardian baroque building is now used for exhibitions and for weddings. He also donated the city's Town Hall and a monument to Queen Victoria in the city's Dalton Square. He bought Ashton Hall in 1884, serving as High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1885. In the 1886 general election, Williamson was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Lancaster, and held his seat at the 1892 election. In 1895 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Ashton, of Ashton in the County Palatine of Lancaster and in 1920 made Constable of Lancaster Castle for life. He married three times; firstly to Margaret Gatey in 1869, with whom he had two daughters, secondly to Jessie Hulme in 1880 and thirdly to Florence Whalley, later Lady Ashton, in 1909, who survived him. His elder daughter Maud died unmarried at the age of 30 and his younger daughter Ella married Viscount Peel in 1899."

During the Lancashire Cotton Famine in 1861-4, Cheetham rose to prominence as President of the Cotton Supply Association: a body that aimed to promote the growth and export of raw cotton outside the US and particularly in the British Raj. As the US cotton supply returned however, Cheetham's frequent attacks on the governance of the Raj gradually caused opinion in Britain and India to turn against the Association, and it dissolved in 1872. His son John Frederick Cheetham was MP for North Derbyshire and later for Stalybridge."

He was re-elected by more comfortable margins at the 1923 general election and at the 1924 general election, but resigned his seat in 1926. The resulting by-election on 21 December 1926, was won by the Labour candidate Oswald Mosley, who went on to found the New Party and the British Union of Fascists. Davison died in March 1927, aged 56."

  "text" : "Sir James Blindell (1884 – 10 May 1937) was a Liberal Party politician in the United Kingdom, who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Holland with Boston from 1929 until his death. He was first elected as the constituency's MP at a by-election in March 1929, caused by the death of the Conservative MP Arthur Dean. At the time he was managing director of a boot manufacturing business. Blindell overturned a Conservative majority of nearly 5,000 to win with a majority of 3,706. His victory was the last Liberal by-election gain until Torrington in 1958. Blindell was re-elected as a Liberal at the 1929 general election, but in 1931 he was one of the Liberal MPs who broke with their party to support Ramsay MacDonald's National Government, eventually forming the National Liberal Party. He was re-elected as a National Liberal at the 1931 general election and at the 1935 general election. In both elections, the Conservatives (who also supported the National Government) did not field a candidate against him, and he was returned with large majorities. Blindell was knighted in 1936, and died in office in 1937. At the consequent Holland with Boston by-election, 1937, Herbert Butcher held the seat for the National Liberals."

  "text" : "John Samuel Potts (12 August 1861 – 28 April 1938) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom who served a Member of Parliament (MP) for twelve years between 1922 and 1938. Born in Bolton, Lancashire, Potts had started work at Durham Colliery at the age of eleven. He was a checkweighman at the Hemsworth Colliery, Yorkshire, for 25 years. At the Barnsley by-election of 1897 Potts supported the Liberal Party-candidate Joseph Walton. While chairing a Liberal election meeting during this by-election, Potts said in the presence of Walton that he would favour a labour party at a time when state payment of MPs, and of official election expenses would enable working men to be maintained in Parliament. But until then, \"the Liberal party was the working man’s only hope\". In 1905, Potts switched sides, and started working with the Independent Labour Party against Walton, and the leadership of the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA). Ten years later Potts was elected as treasurer of the YMA, and became a member of the executive committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. He kept these positions until he was elected as MP for Barnsley at the 1922 general election, when payment of MPs and election expenses had been enacted. Potts held the seat at three further elections in the 1920s. When Labour split at the 1931 general election over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of a National Government, he narrowly lost his seat to the National Liberal candidate Richard John Soper. Potts was comfortably re-elected at the 1935 general election, but died in office in 1938, in Barnsley, aged 76. His illness and death have been connected with the shock he received when the Wharncliffe Woodmoor Pit Disaster occurred two years earlier. His home was in the lane which led to the colliery."

  "text" : "Joseph Lynn Leicester (24 December 1825 – 13 October 1903) was an English glass blower and Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1886. Born in Warrington, he was the son of Thomas Leicester, a glassblower. At the age of nine, Leicester was apprenticed to his father's trade. In 1850 he moved to Lambeth in London, and was employed for 35 years as a glass-blower by James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars, London. Soon after his arrival in the capital he was appointed secretary of the Glassmakers Trade Society, a position he held for more than forty years. He was sent by the Society of Arts to report upon glass at the Paris Exhibitions in 1867 and 1868. The Society awarded him three first-class prizes for art and in 1870 the Glass Blowers' Society of Great Britain and Ireland presented him with £100 in recognition of his services to the trade. He was a strong temperance advocate, and was in favour of Sunday closing of public houses. In the 1885 general election, Leicester was elected Member of Parliament for West Ham South but in the 1886 general election, he was defeated by the Conservative candidate. He made four contributions during his year in parliament. At the 1892 general election he was again chosen to contest the West Ham South seat for the Liberals. However, the party withdrew from the constituency, in favour of Keir Hardie of the Independent Labour Party, who went on to win the seat. Leicester died at the age of 77 and was buried in Nunhead Cemetery. His gravestone noted: \"From a poor working lad he became an eloquent advocate of temperance, a master craftsman in the art of glass making, and all his life took a foremost part in the social elevation of his fellow workmen, who did honour to themselves and him, by returning him as a Member of Parliament\"\"Write him down as one who loved his fellow man\""

Already ill, he was unable to travel from London to campaign in the seat, but was elected in his absence, defeating the Coalition Liberal MP, Harry Barnes.

In 1894 he was elected to Manchester City Council as an Independent Labour Party councillor for the Bradford ward, an area previously represented by Conservatives. At the general election of January 1910 Sutton was elected as Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester East, the constituency that included the Bradford area. He held the seat until its abolition in 1918. At the 1918 general election Sutton stood in the new seat of Manchester Clayton, losing to the Conservative, Edward Hopkinson. Hopkinson died in 1922, forcing a by-election, and Sutton was selected as Labour candidate. The Coalition Government was very unpopular due to high unemployment and severe cutbacks recommended by the Geddes Report, and Sutton easily won the seat. He held the seat at subsequent general elections until 1931 when a large swing to the Conservatives was reflected in Clayton. William Flanagan, Sutton's opponent in the 1922 by-election took the seat. Sutton did not contest another parliamentary election."

  "text" : "Joseph (Joe) Toole (1887 – 4 June 1945) was a British Labour politician. Toole was born in 1887, and was the eldest of thirteen children. He began working at the age of 12 as a street scavenger in Manchester by day and as a newspaper vendor by night. He subsequently had various jobs, before establishing his own stationery business. He joined the Labour Party, and was elected to Manchester City Council in 1919. In 1923 he was elected as Labour member of parliament for Salford South, unseating the sitting Conservative MP. In the following year another election was held, with the Conservatives regaining the seat. At the following election in 1929 Toole was able to regain Salford South for Labour. He was MP for two years before a swing against Labour at the 1931 general election cost him his seat. He stood again, without success, in 1935. Toole returned to local government as an alderman for the Openshaw ward of Manchester City Council. He was Lord Mayor of the city in 1936/37. In January 1944 Toole stood as an independent anti-government candidate at a parliamentary by-election in Skipton. Although he only garnered 3,029 votes and lost his deposit, his intervention was enough to enable Hugh Lawson of the Common Wealth Party to defeat the coalition candidate by 221 votes. Toole was promptly expelled from the Labour Party for breaking the war-time electoral truce between the main political parties. By the time of his death in June 1945, Toole had moved to Blackpool, where he operated a private hotel. He continued to be a member of Manchester City Council until his death."

(August 1875 – 25 May 1945) was a British trade unionist and Labour Party politician, who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Wednesbury from 1932 until his death in 1945. Banfield was General Secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers from 1915 until he retired in 1940.He unsuccessfully contested the 1918 general election in Birmingham Aston. He was a government delegate representing the work people at Geneva from 1924 to 1925. He was unsuccessful in Fulham West at a by-election in 1930 and at the 1931 general election. In 1932, the Conservative MP for Wednesbury, Viscount Ednam succeeded to the peerage as Earl of Dudley, triggering a by-election in July 1932. Banfield was selected as Labour's candidate, hoping to regain a seat which had been held by Labour from 1918 to 1931.After a campaign focusing on the means test for unemployment benefit (in a constituency with 12,000 unemployed), Banfield won the Wednesbury 1932 by-election. He was re-elected at the 1935 general election. In December 1936, he delivered an address, 'Sunday: An M.P.'s Convictions' at the Alliance Birthday Celebrations of the Imperial Alliance for the Defence of Sunday, arguing that Sunday should be a day of rest and worship. In June 1937 he made a speech in Parliament, proposing the addition of a clause to the Factories Bill: Prohibition of night work in bakehouses. His campaigning led to him being known as \"the bakers' MP\". Banfield died aged 69, in Hammersmith, London of a heart attack shortly before the 1945 general election."

By 1915 he had become president of the Shoe and Boot Operatives. By 1919 he had moved to Leicester. In that year he was appointed by the Minister of Labour to the Trade Board for the Shoe and Boot Repairing Trade as a workers' representative. In 1922 he was the travelling organiser for his union and the society's principal negotiator. In the general election of 1922 he was elected to the Commons as member of parliament for the Eccles Division of Lancashire, unseating the Conservative incumbent, Marshall Stevens. He held the seat when a further election was held in 1923. Although his total number of votes fell from 14,354 to 12,227 he was able to increase his majority over Stevens from 1,803 to 1,863 with the anti-Labour vote split by the presence of a Liberal Party candidate. A minority Labour government that was formed following the election collapsed in October 1924, necessitating a further general election. Although he managed to increase his vote, Buckle was defeated in a straight fight by the Conservative candidate Albert Bethel by over 2,000 votes. He died in the following year."

During this time, he was elected to the seventh Michigan Territorial Legislative Council for the western area of Michigan Territory; he was then elected to the Wisconsin Territorial Council (the equivalent of the present Wisconsin State Senate). In February 1842, in the course of a heated debate over the appointment of a sheriff for Grant County, Vineyard clashed with Charles C. P. Arndt. After the body was adjourned, Arndt's temper remained heated, he charged Vineyard's desk, and Vineyard shot Arndt dead upon the Council floor. Vineyard had boarded with the Arndt family in Green Bay during the winter of 1835-36, and is reported to have been regarded as almost one of the family; the two men were considered fast friends (even staying at the same boarding house in Madison). He was tried and acquitted of the murder and later served in the first Wisconsin Constitutional Convention of 1846 and was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1848 for one term. In 1850, he moved to California to join the Gold Rush. He settled in Sacramento, California, where he was an Indian agent. There he was elected to the California State Assembly in 1855. In 1861, he moved to Los Angeles, California, and was elected to the California State Senate in 1863. He died in Los Angeles on August 30, 1863."

He was defeated in that constituency at the 1859 general election. After a six-year absence, Whatman was returned to the House of Commons at the 1865 election for the borough of Maidstone, and held that seat until he stood down at the 1874 general election.

He had previously stood unsuccessfully in the North Lonsdale at the general elections in January 1910 and December 1910, losing narrowly both occasions. In January 1910, Bliss's campaign team asked for recount after the vote was declared, but were told that the ballot boxes had already been sealed and sent by train to London. He lodged a petition, which claimed that invalid votes for Haddock had been allowed while valid votes for Bliss had been disallowed. The petition was heard in the King's Bench Division of the High Court, before Justice Lawrence and Justice Phillimore. They allowed a recount, in which the Conservative George Haddock's majority was increased to 169 votes (2.0%), and Bliss was required to pay the costs of the hearing. The Cockermouth constituency was abolished at the 1918 general election, when Bliss was one of two sitting MPs who contested the new Lonsdale constituency. The Coalition Coupon went to his Conservative opponent Claude Lowther, who won the seat. Bliss did not stand for Parliament again."

  "text" : "James Patrick Gardner (5 March 1883 - 25 July 1937) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. Born in Belfast, he was educated by the Christian Brothers there before taking up the trade of architectural sculptor. He moved to Hammersmith in West London, where he became a member of the borough council in 1919. He was also an official in the National Furnishing Trades Association. In 1922 he was chosen by the Labour Party to contest the Conservative-held seat of Hammersmith North. He failed to be elected on that occasion, but when another election was held in the following year he was elected MP for North Hammersmith by the narrow margin of 845 votes. He was unseated after less than a year when a further election was held in October 1924. In 1926, Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, the MP for Hammersmith North, resigned. In the resulting by-election, held against the background of the General Strike, Gardner regained the seat with the substantial majority of 3,611 votes. He retained the seat at the 1929 general election. Following the election the Labour Party formed a minority government. This was subsequently replaced by a National Government in August 1931 leading to a split in the Labour Party. At the election held in October 1931 Gardner, like most Labour MPs opposing the government, was defeated. Gardner did not return to parliamentary politics after his 1931 defeat, but was a member of the Hammersmith council until his death."

He enjoyed photography and gardening and was a keen independent traveller. He married twice and has a son by his first wife and two sons by his second wife, Marjorie Ogden, who died on 24 March 2010."

Re-elected in the 1945 general election, he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of Food, and served in this role until 1946. In 1947, in the course of an investigation by the parliamentary Committee of Privileges into claims that Labour members had given information to journalists about confidential meetings of the Labour Party in return for payment, Walkden admitted revealing information to the Evening News. He was found guilty of breach of privilege by the Committee and reprimanded by the Speaker. Another MP, Garry Allighan, was expelled from the House, but Walkden was not as he admitted the offence and had paid tax on the money he had been paid. He resigned the party whip and sat as an independent until the 1950 election, in which he did not stand. Lord Robens commented after his death that Walkden was \"an able Trade Union official and an able Parliamentarian and worked hard to bring about reforms in the rationing systems during the war. He was a thorn in the side of the black marketeers and his activities led to the closing of many loopholes.\""

Following a private education, he went into business as a wine merchant, and in 1894 established Hatch, Mansfield and Company. Hatch was unsuccessful Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Gorton Division of Lancashire at a by-election in 1889 and at the succeeeding general election in 1892. On his third attempt, in the 1895 election, he was elected as Gorton's MP. Hatch remained as Conservative member for Gorton until 1904, when his disagreement with Joseph Chamberlain over free trade led to him crossing the floor to the Liberal Party. At the next general election in 1906 he had little support from Liberal activists for his candidature, and accordingly withdrew. In 1908 he was created a baronet, \"of Portland Place, in the Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone\". He was appointed chairman and treasurer of University College Hospital, London During the First World War he chaired the Government Commission on Belgian Refugees, and was made a commander of the Belgian Order of the Crown. He was also Chairman of Council of the Beyond Seas Association for Reception of Officers and Relatives from beyond the seas, and for this he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1920 New Year Honours. Ernest Hatch married Lady Constance Blanche Godolphin Osborne in 1900, aunt of John Osborne, later Duke of Leeds.

  "text" : "Edward Ryley (or Riley) Langworthy (1797 - 7 April 1874) was a British businessman and Liberal politician. Langworthy was born in London, the son of a Somerset merchant. After spending some years in South and Central America, he moved to Salford, Lancashire in 1840 to establish a cotton business with his brother, George. Langworthy Brothers and Company was established at Greengate Mills. When Salford was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1844, Langworthy was elected as the first alderman for Trinity ward. He was the borough's fifth mayor, elected for two consecutive terms from 1848 to 1850. His term as mayor saw the establishment of the free public museum and library at Peel Park In January 1857, Salford's Liberal member of parliament, Joseph Brotherton, died. Langworthy was selected as the party's candidate for the vacancy, and as the only nominee, was elected unopposed on 2 February. Following his election he gave a speech outlining his political views: he supported the temperance movement, free trade and civil and religious freedom, the reform of parliament, strengthened local government, but opposed any increase in the size of the country's armed forces. He was only Salford's MP for a matter of months, as he did not stand at the subsequent general election later in the year. Langworthy retained his connection with Salford Corporation, and on his death in 1874 left £10,000 to the museum and library he had helped establish. Langworthy Road, constructed shortly after his death, was named in his memory by Salford Borough Council."

They later co-authored \"The North-West Passage by Land\"  and \" Voyage de l'Atlantique au Pacifique, à travers le Canada\", which described their expedition in considerable detail. Following his adventure in Canada, Milton entered politics and became one of the youngest members of the House of Commons. He represented the West Riding of Yorkshire South between 1865 and 1872."

They had three daughters before her untimely death: Olive, Bessie, and Josphine Brack. It is unclear exactly when Brack settled in the Orlando area. He was certainly there by October 16, 1873, when he was mentioned as guardian ad litem for the orphans of Mrs. Lucinda Hughey Terrell in a lawsuit filed in the circuit court of Orange County, Florida. In 1875, when Orlando was formally incorporated, Brack was elected its first mayor. He was subsequently re-elected to a second one-year term. After leaving office, the former mayor remained in the Orlando area as a farmer and fruit grower until at least 1880. He was married there to his third wife Eliza Alpha Tyson on March 6, 1881. They had eight children: John Percy (\"Jack\"), Rosa Banner, Gussie, Emma Hortense, Ruby B, Blanche Alice, and Lillian Bell Brack, William Jackson, Jr The Bracks left Orlando to live on the north shore of Lake Tohopekaliga in what is now Osceola County, Florida, where they operated a general store and sawmill at \"Brack's Landing.\" From that point, he also captained a 35-foot sidewheel steamboat called \"Spray\" along the inland canals that connected the Kissimmee River valley to Fort Myers, Florida on the Gulf of Mexico. The former mayor retired to a cattle ranch near Narcoossee, Florida, where he died April 30, 1901. He is buried at Mount Peace Cemetery in Saint Cloud, Florida."

  "text" : "Sir William Thomas Gustavus Cook (1834 – 26 January 1908) was a British industrialist and Liberal politician who was active in local government in Birmingham and sat in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1886. He was the second son of Anselm Cook of Kingscourt, Stroud, Gloucestershire. He took up an apprenticeship to the pin and wire trade in Birmingham and subsequently set up his own business as a manufacturer of tacks and shoe rivets. In 1872 Cook was elected to Birmingham Town Council, and in 1875 became chairman of the Borough Health Committee. He was made an alderman in 1882, and served as Mayor of Birmingham in 1883/84. In 1885 he was selected as Liberal candidate for the newly created constituency of Birmingham East, and won the seat at general election of that year. He was only a member of the House of Commons for a brief period, however, as he was defeated by his Conservative opponent when another election was held in 1886. He was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for the Bordesley constituency of Birmingham at the 1895 general election. Cook was a justice of the peace for Warwickshire and the City of Birmingham, and made his home at Ashley House, Birchfield, Staffordshire, on the outskirts of the city. He was knighted in 1906. William Cook died in Blackpool in January 1908, aged 73."

He first entered the House of Commons at the 1892. Aged only 22, he was elected as the Liberal Party MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, defeating the incumbent Liberal Unionist MP, Douglas Coghill. He was re-elected at the 1895 election, but was defeated at the 1900 general election. This was on account of his active service in the Second Boer War. He did not seek election again until the 1924 general election, when he stood as a Constitutionalist candidate in the Burslem constituency, but narrowly lost the two-way contest to his Labour Party opponent Andrew MacLaren. Allen did not stand in 1929, but when he stood as National Liberal at the 1931 general election he won the seat from MacLaren, who regained the seat at the 1935 general election. Allen did not stand again. He lived at the Allen family home, Woodhead Hall, in Cheadle."

  "text" : "William Bennett (7 April 1873 – 4 November 1937) was a British Labour Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Battersea South in London from 1929 to 1931. He first stood for Parliament at the 1918 general election, when he was unsuccessful in Guildford, a safe seat for the Conservative Party. He contested Guilford again in 1922 and 1923, and did not stand again until the Battersea South by-election in February 1929. The vacancy had arisen when the Conservative MP Francis Curzon succeeded to the peerage as Earl Howe, and in a three-way contest Bennett took the seat for Labour with a majority of 2.1% of the votes. He was re-elected at the general election in May 1929 with a majority of only 1.1%, but at the 1931 general election he was soundly defeated by the Conservative Harry Selley, whose majority was 36.2%. After his defeat, Bennett stood unsuccessfully at the June 1933 by-election in Hitchin, at a November 1933 by-election in Harborough and in the 1935 general election in Cardiff East. Bennett was never returned to the House of Commons, but after Labour gained control of the London County Council from the Municipal Reform Party in 1934, he was appointed on 13 March as an alderman of the Council."

He then speculated in mining shares. He was a Liberal Member of Parliament for Merthyr Tydfil, from 1888 to 1900, when he was defeated, losing his seat to Keir Hardie. The constituency had two members, the other being the Liberal David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda: there was antagonism between the two Liberals, however, and in 1900 Thomas backed Hardie. A major political issue between them was attitude to the Second Boer War, supported by Morgan who was on the Liberal imperialist wing of the party. He was in favour of Welsh disestablishment, making a lengthy parliamentary speech on a resolution in 1891."

He held the seat until January 1910 when he was defeated by his Conservative opponent, Benjamin Bathurst. He returned to the Commons at the election of December 1910, when he was elected to represent Stafford. He was knighted in 1913 and made an honorary freeman of Stafford. Following a redistribution of seats, Essex stood at the new seat of Stoke-on-Trent, Burslem at the 1918 general election but was not elected. Essex was twice married: to Marie Chinchen of Swanage, Dorset in 1881. Following her death in 1883 he married Lizzie Benson of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1885, with whom he had four children.

  "text" : "William John Harper (22 July 1916 – 8 September 2006) was a politician, general contractor and Royal Air Force fighter pilot who served as a Cabinet minister in Rhodesia (or Southern Rhodesia) from 1962 to 1968, and signed that country's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from Britain in 1965. Born into a prominent Anglo-Indian merchant family in Calcutta, Harper was educated in India and England and joined the RAF in 1937. He served as an officer throughout the Second World War and saw action as one of \"The Few\" in the Battle of Britain, during which he was wounded in action. Appalled by Britain's granting of independence to India in 1947, he emigrated to Rhodesia on retiring from the air force two years later. Harper contended that British rule in the subcontinent should never have ended, and took a similar stance regarding his adopted homeland, reportedly declaring that it, South Africa and the neighbouring Portuguese territories would \"be under white rule forever\". He entered politics with the Dominion Party in 1958 and became Minister of Irrigation, Roads and Road Traffic in the Rhodesian Front (RF) government in 1962. The head of a far-right group within the RF, he called for Rhodesia to abolish black representation in parliament and adopt \"a form of political apartheid\". When the Prime Minister Winston Field resigned in 1964, Harper was a front-runner to succeed him, but lost out to Ian Smith, who moved him to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Each breakdown or setback during the early years of Smith's premiership prompted press speculation that Harper might replace him. In 1966, when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Harper led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to their rejection. Harper resigned from the Rhodesian Front in 1968, soon after Smith dismissed him from the Cabinet, reportedly because Harper had had an extramarital affair with a British agent. He subsequently became a vocal critic of the Prime Minister, greeting each step Smith made towards settlement with black nationalists during the Bush War with public indignation. By the time majority rule began in Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement of the previous year, Harper had left for South Africa. He died in 2006 at the age of 90."

His father and his two surviving brothers were all Members of Parliament (MPs): his eldest brother Spencer, MP for North Lancashire 1857–91 and later 8th Duke of Devonshire, led the Liberal Party and was asked three times to be Prime Minister by Queen Victoria; the middle brother, Frederick was MP for the West Riding and Chief Secretary for Ireland and was assassinated in 1882. Cavendish was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade. On retirement from the regular army he joined the 2nd Derbyshire Militia (later the Sherwood Foresters), but transferred to the King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment in 1888. Cavendish served as MP for West Derbyshire from the creation of the constituency until his death. Like his eldest brother, he became a Liberal Unionist in reaction to the Liberal Party's policy on Irish Home Rule. Upon his death in Marylebone aged 53, his son, Victor, was elected unopposed to replace him, later becoming the 9th Duke of Devonshire. Cavendish married his cousin Emma Lascelles, a daughter of the Rt. Hon. William Lascelles, on 3 August 1865. They had three sons:"

He was born in London on 14 June 1825, the second of three sons of Major-General Lord George William Russell and Elizabeth Anne Rawdon, daughter of the Hon. John Theophilus Rawdon, himself second son of the 1st Earl of Moira. His elder brother was Francis, later 9th Duke of Bedford and his younger brother was Odo, later 1st Baron Ampthill. He was educated in Germany and from 1849 to 1854 he was private Secretary to his uncle, the Liberal Prime Minister Lord John Russell. Between 1857 and 1885, he sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tavistock. He only spoke rarely in the Commons, once in reply to an attack on his brother Odo. On 25 September 1865, Russell married Laura de Peyronnet, daughter of Paul Louis Jules, Vicomte de Peyronnet. They had six children, Harold Russell, Flora Russell, the diplomat Sir Claud Russell, Caroline Russell, Major Gilbert Russell and Conrad Russell. He was raised to the rank of a Duke's son on 25 June 1872 and was then known as Lord Arthur Russell. He was a great clubman and belonged to Brooks's, the Athenaeum, the Cosmopolitan, Grillion's, THE CLUB, and the Metaphysical Society. He was involved in the Senate of the University of London, serving on this body from 1875 to his death. Russell died on 4 April 1892 at 2 Audley Square, London, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. There is a memorial to him in the 'Bedford Chapel' at St. Michael’s Church, Chenies. The ideological gulf between Britain and the new German Empire was stressed by Lord Russell in 1872: Prussia now represents all that is most antagonistic to the liberal and democratic ideas of the age; military despotism, the rule of the sword, contempt for sentimental talk, indifference to human suffering, imprisonment of independent opinion, transfer by force of unwilling populations to a hateful yoke, disregard of European opinion, total want of greatness and generosity, etc., etc.\""

At the 1931 general election, Mallalieu was elected as the Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Colne Valley. His win was notable as it was a gain from Labour despite the presence of a Conservative candidate, unusual for 1931. His predecessor was the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden, who had decided to stand down. His father Frederick Mallalieu had been MP for the same seat from 1916 to 1922. Mallalieu was a member of the main Liberal group in parliament led by Sir Herbert Samuel. He followed his leader into opposition in 1933. He served until the 1935 general election, when he lost his seat to Labour's Ernest Marklew. After joining the Labour Party, he returned to the House of Commons in 1948, at a by-election on 24 March in the Brigg constituency, where he served as MP until he retired in 1974.

He first stood for parliament at the 1900 General Election when he was the unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the Conservative seat of Salford West. Mallet was returned to Parliament for Plymouth in 1906. In 1908 he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Walter Runciman who was President of the Board of Education. In February 1910 Asquith was considering him as a possible Chief Whip but was dissuaded by the outgoing Chief Whip Jack Pease who felt he was out of sympathy with many leading Liberals over the Lords. In March 1910 Prime Minister H. H. Asquith appointed him Financial Secretary to the War Office, a position he held until he was defeated in the December general election of the same year. He sought a return to parliament at the Salford North by-election, 1917 as a Coalition Liberal candidate but was defeated by an Independent Labour candidate. He did not contest the 1918 General Election. He was Honorary Secretary of the Free Trade Union. He became a supporter of the official Liberal party that opposed the Coalition Government. He sought to make a return to parliament standing as Liberal candidate for South Aberdeen, in 1922 without success. He tried again in 1923 without success. He had published two works on Liberal politicians; Mr Lloyd George, a Study (1930) and Herbert Gladstone, a Memoir (1932). His book on Lloyd George was entirely devoted to the shortcomings of the Liberal Leader."

  "text" : "Charles Cecil Cotes (7 April 1846 – 9 August 1898) was a British landowner and Liberal politician. Cotes was born in 1846, eldest surviving son of John Cotes of Woodcote Hall near Newport, Shropshire (himself a former MP) and his wife Lady Louisa Jenkinson, daughter of Charles Jenkinson, 3rd Earl of Liverpool, and thus nephew of the former Prime Minister, the 2nd Earl. He was educated at Eton College, then entered Christ Church, Oxford in 1864, graduating as B.A. in 1869. Cotes served in the South Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry as lieutenant before being promoted captain in 1869. This regiment amalgamated to form the unified Shropshire Yeomanry in 1872, and he continued to serve with them until he retired in 1880. Cotes first sought election to Parliament for the then two-member borough seat of Shrewsbury at a by-election following the death of William Clement in 1870 and polled 1,253 votes but was defeated by a majority of 38 by his Conservative opponent, Douglas Straight. Cotes petitioned against the result but the case was dismissed in court with costs. He entered Parliament for Shrewsbury at the 1874 general election, and held the seat until 1885. That year Shrewsbury was reduced to a one-member seat and Cotes did not seek further election to Parliament. When the Liberals came to power in 1880 under William Ewart Gladstone, he was appointed a Junior Lord of the Treasury, which he remained until the government fell in 1885. Following his father's death in 1874, Cotes succeeded to his estates in Shropshire and Staffordshire in England and Montgomeryshire in Wales, which in 1876 amounted to 6,470 acres with an income of £8.860 a year. He had Woodcote Hall rebuilt after a disastrous fire. He reputedly owned the first motor car registered in Shropshire, vehicle registration number \"AW1\". Cotes was a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for the counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire and at the time of his death was a trustee of the Harper Adams Agricultural College which was then being erected near Newport. Cotes died suddenly at Woodcote Hall, of a heart attack, in August 1898, aged 52, and was buried on 12 August in Woodcote churchyard. He was unmarried and his estates passed to his brother."

Harrison was born in Muswell Hill, Middlesex, and was the third son of Frederick Harrison, a stockbroker, and his wife, Jane Brice. He was educated at King's College School and King's College London. In 1858 he entered business as a solicitor at the firm of his uncle, also named Charles Harrison. He acquired a large practice in his own right, with major clients being the London Chatham and Dover Railway and the Law Fire Insurance Society. He became an advocate of the rights of tenants to purchase their properties and of the provision of housing for the working classes. In this he was in agreement with the policies of the Radical wing of the Liberal Party. In 1886 he married Lady Harriet Barlow. His active involvement with politics came with the creation of the London County Council in 1889. He was elected as one of the council's first members, representing Bethnal Green South West as a member of the Liberal-backed Progressive Party. He was a leading member of the council, and vice-chairman from 1892 – 1895. His interests in the government of the capital led him to call for the municipalisation of the London docks and the unification of the City of London with the county. On two occasions Harrison stood for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons on behalf of the Liberals. In 1892 he failed to be elected at Plymouth. He stood again at the ensuing general election in 1895, and became one of the town's two members of parliament, while continuing to hold his seat on the London County Council. Harrison became suddenly ill with inflammation of the throat at the funeral of Sir Frank Lockwood on 23 December 1897 and died at his London home on the following day from heart failure."

A member of the Democratic Party, he challenged Jeb Bush for Florida governor in the 2002 gubernatorial election. Bush won by a 56 to 43 percent margin, making him the first Republican governor of Florida to serve two terms. McBride had earlier defeated former United States Attorney General Janet Reno in the Democratic primary. McBride was born in Belleville, Illinois and grew up in Leesburg, Florida. He graduated from the University of Florida in 1967. While at UF, McBride served as treasurer of Florida Blue Key and was inducted into the University of Florida Hall of Fame. McBride served in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1971. McBride was awarded a Bronze Star with a Valor device. Upon his return to the United States, McBride taught at Officer Candidates School at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Upon leaving the Marine Corps, McBride attended the University of Florida Law School. While studying law he fell under the tutelage of Chesterfield Smith, a powerful politically connected Florida attorney and then president of the American Bar Association. McBride left law school for a time to serve as Smith's assistant at the ABA. After graduation, McBride joined Smith's Tampa law firm, Holland & Knight, where he rose in the ranks until becoming managing partner in 1992. McBride's tenure at the helm of Holland & Knight has been the source of some controversy. He is credited with having expanded the firm's size and power and with having helped to make it the seventh-largest firm in the U.S. by number of lawyers employed at the time of his retirement in 2001. At the time the firm ranked 21st in terms of revenue but 98th in terms of profit-per-partner, and had \"become known as a reputable, but flabby, operation, long on underproductive partners and comparatively short on workhorse associates.\" McBride was the father of two children with his wife, Adelaide \"Alex\" Sink, a former statewide president for NationsBank (now Bank of America), former Chief Financial Officer of Florida, and 2010 Democratic nominee for Governor of Florida. Since 2003, Bill McBride was partner with the law firm of Barnett, Bolt, Kirkwood, Long & McBride in Tampa. He was also chair of the board of the investment banking firm Hyde Park Capital Partners, LLC, with offices in Tampa and Charlotte, North Carolina. McBride was a member of the American Law Institute and was a member of the board of directors of the Warrington College of Business Administration's Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Florida. McBride was named Mr. Leesburg High while still a student. He attended Boy's State while in school and ran a successful campaign for governor at the event. McBride died on December 22, 2012, after suffering a heart attack while vacationing with his family in Mt Airy, North Carolina."

O'Malley's crowning achievement was obtaining cross-party support for a new State pension scheme (after two aborted attempts by previous Governments) and steering through Parliament the bill to implement what became the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. While Barbara Castle, the Secretary of State, took much of the credit, it was O'Malley who did all the hard work. In 1976, O'Malley's career was cut short by his death at the age of 46, following complications after brain surgery. Stanley Crowther was elected as his successor in the subsequent by-election."

In parliament, he found himself at odds with many Labour MPs and contemplated joining the Liberals. He was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and Chief Whip in 1924, when he was made a Privy Councillor. He had suffered from poor health since contracting malaria at Salonika during World War I. On a visit to London in December 1928, he was found dead in bed at the Regent Palace Hotel. At the inquest, his son said that his father had taken to drinking heavily. His death, it was decided, was due to syncope from disease of the heart and liver, due to chronic alcoholism."

  "text" : "Benjamin Thomas Williams (19 November 1832 – 21 March 1890) was a Welsh barrister and Liberal Party politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1878 to 1882. Williams was the eldest son of T R Williams of Narberth Pembrokeshire, and his wife Mira Thomas daughter of B R Thomas. He was educated at Glasgow University where he was senior prizeman in logic and university medalist in metaphysics. In 1859, he was called to the bar at Gray's Inn and then went on the South Wales and Chester circuits. He was Recorder of Carmarthen from 1872 to 1878 and became a Queen's Counsel in 1875. He was for a while editor of the Law Magazine and was a J.P. for Pembrokeshire, chairman of the South Narbeth School Board, and member of the councils of the University of Glasgow and the University College of Wales. In 1867, Williams sought to be nominated as a candidate for the second seat for Merthyr Boroughs and held a public meeting at Aberdare to support his candidature. He protested against the actions of Thomas Price in using this meeting to promote the candidature of Richard Fothergill. In May 1878 Williams was elected at an unopposed by-election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Carmarthen Boroughs. He was re-elected in 1880 but resigned from Parliament in 1882 to become a County Court judge. Williams died at the age of 57. Williams married Margaret John daughter of T John of Dolemain in 1857."

An EMS instructor from Wilmington, North Carolina, Wright was serving his eighth term in the House when he was expelled from that chamber in 2008. A jury subsequently convicted him of corruption and embezzlement, sending him to jail for a 6-8 year term. In 2007, the North Carolina State Board of Elections launched an investigation of Wright's campaign finances. The board recommended that Wright be prosecuted, and information revealed in the board's hearings led to calls for Wright to resign. Wright was indicted by a Wake County grand jury \"on five charges of obtaining property by false pretenses and one charge of obstruction of justice\" on December 10, 2007. A House committee unanimously found probable cause to proceed on eight counts of misconduct in 2008. Acting on that committee's final recommendations, the full House voted 109-5 to expel Wright on March 20, 2008. He was the first member of the House expelled since Josiah Turner in 1880. A few weeks later, a jury found him guilty and he was sentenced to 6–8 years imprisonment. Wright was on the primary ballot to get his seat back, but was removed from the ballot as a result of his conviction; the North Carolina Constitution, like those of most other states, does not allow convicted felons to hold office. He was released on May 27th, 2014 after six years in prison."

He served as a councillor on Northamptonshire County Council from 1952 and as an alderman from 1961. Bradley contested Rutland and Stamford as a Labour candidate in 1950, 1951 and 1955, and Preston South in 1959. He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Leicester North East at a 1962 by-election, representing Leicester East from 1974. He served as parliamentary private secretary to the Home Secretary from 1966. Bradley was among the Labour MPs who defected to the new Social Democratic Party in 1981. In 1983, he stood for re-election in Leicester East but came third with 21% of the vote. This however may have had the effect of helping the Conservative candidate Peter Bruinvels beat the future Labour minister Patricia Hewitt by 933 votes. He died in Kettering aged 76."

In 1970, he led the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and spearheaded the drive to hold the annual Earth Day commemoration in Philadelphia. That event became one of the biggest Earth Day events in the nation. He was also instrumental in the creation of the Greater Delaware Valley Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. He was predeceased by his half sister, Nella Cameron Downward (1913-1997). His younger brother, Frank Hoover Longstreth (b. 1922) died in 2008. He was a two-time Republican nominee for Mayor of Philadelphia, first in 1955, losing to Richardson Dilworth, and again in 1971, losing to Frank Rizzo. He was initially elected to Philadelphia's City Council in 1967, resigning his seat to run for Mayor in 1971. While a member of City Council, he served as a sideline reporter on Philadelphia Eagles radio broadcasts on WIP in 1969 and 1970. Longstreth was again elected to Council in 1983, defeating incumbent councilwoman Beatrice Chernock for the at-large seat he had vacated twelve years earlier to run for Mayor. He would remain in office until his death. During his tenure on Council, Longstreth helped support the efforts of Edmund Bacon to bring an urban renaissance to Philadelphia. He was also well known for wearing bow ties and argyle socks. He suffered from Parkinson's disease, and died of a pulmonary embolism while on vacation in Naples, Florida."

He was elected to the St Austell Division of Cornwall in a by-election in 1908 and held the seat until his death. He was commissioned a second-lieutenant in the Royal 1st Devon Imperial Yeomanry on 4 June 1902. At the outbreak of World War I he joined the Royal Bucks Hussars as an officer. Tommy then joined the Coldstream Guards and was subsequently posted to France & Flanders. Captain The Honourable Thomas Charles Reginald Agar-Robartes, in command of No. 2 Coy, 1st Bn, the Coldstream Guards, was wounded in the Battle of Loos on 28 September and killed by a sniper on 30 September 1915 after rescuing a wounded comrade under heavy fire for which he was recommended for the Victoria Cross. He is buried in Lapugnoy Military Cemetery, near Béthune. He is commemorated by a memorial in Truro Cathedral and in stained glass at Wimpole and Church Norton. Agar-Robartes is commemorated on Panel 8 of the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall, one of 22 MPs that died during World War I to be named on that memorial. Agar-Robartes is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which included a short biographical account of the life and death of Agar-Robartes. His younger brother Francis later succeeded their father in the viscountcy."

He was the only son of John Horridge, chemist, of Tonge with Haulgh, and Margaret Barlow of Bolton, Lancashire. He was educated in Barnes, Surrey before becoming a solicitor in Southport in 1879. In 1884 he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple, serving in the Northern Circuit. In January 1901 it was announced that he was to be appointed a queen's counsel. With Victoria's death, the warrant was issued by her successor, Edward VII, and he became a king's counsel. In 1906 he was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester East, spectacularly unseating the former Conservative prime minister, Arthur Balfour. He particularly campaigned on the \"Chinese Slavery\" issue: the Conservative government's policy of using indentured Chinese labourers, housed in primitive enclosures, to operate South African gold mines. Horridge stood down at the next general election in January, 1910, and resumed his legal career. He was promptly appointed a judge of the King's Bench Division, a decision that was criticised as political at the time. He subsequently dealt with cases in the Divorce and Bankruptcy Courts, and also took part in the trial for treason of Roger Casement. He was elected treasurer of the Middle Temple in 1929. In 1937 he announced his resignation from the bench, aged 79. He was appointed a member of the privy council upon his retirement. He died at his home in Hove, Sussex in 1938, aged 80. Horridge was married twice. In 1901 he married Evelyne Sandys of Lanarth, Cornwall, who died in 1920. In 1921 he married May Ethel Markham, widow of Alfred Isenberg. There were no children from either marriage."

He was a captain in the Monmouthshire Militia and a J.P., living at Triley Court Abergavenny. He also rented Skreens Park, a large mansion near Chelmsford which is now demolished. After losing his Paliamentary seat in 1895 he became a county councillor and Justice of the Peacefor Essex. In 1898, he purchased Marks Hall with a fine mansion and deer park. Later he purchased the Villa Capponi, a fine 15th-century villa just outside Florence. His second wife suffered ill-health and they spent a large part of the year there. In 1907, in consultation with Sir George Murray of the Treasury and Sir David Prain, director of Kew Gardens, he made provision in his will to leave the Marks Hall estate to the nation in the interest of agriculture, arboriculture and forestry. During the Second World War, Earls Colne Airfield was built on the edge of the deer park, and much of the property was requisitioned. By 1949 the mansion was said to be in a dangerous state and it was demolished in 1950."

At the 1832 general election he was elected as an MP for West Kent, holding that seat until 1841, when two Conservative Party candidates were elected unopposed. He was returned for West Kent at a contested election in 1847 and held the seat until his defeat at the 1852 general election. Hodges lived at Hemsted Place, Cranbrook, Kent, and died at the age of 80. Hodges married Rebecca Twisden, daughter of Sir Roger Twisden, Bt in 1802. His son Thomas Twisden Hodges was also a politician."

  "text" : "Tom Myers (15 February 1872 – 21 December 1949) was a British Labour Party politician. Born in Mirfield, Myers left school at the age of 12 and spent several years working in coal mines and factories in the West Riding of Yorkshire before taking up employment at a glass bottle works. An early supporter of the Labour Party, he was elected to Thornhill Urban District Council in 1904. In 1910 the urban district was absorbed by the municipal borough of Dewsbury, and Myers became a member of Dewsbury Borough Council. At the 1918 general election Myers contested the constituency of Spen Valley for the Labour Party, but failed to unseat the sitting Coalition Liberal member of parliament, Sir Thomas Whittaker. Whittaker died in November 1919, and Myers was selected to fight the ensuing by election. The by-election came at the same time as a serious split in the Liberal Party over continuing support for the coalition government: Colonel B C Fairfax was nominated as the Coalition Liberal candidate while Sir John Simon stood as an Independent Liberal. The poll was held on 20 December 1919, although the votes were not counted until 3 January of the following year. Myers received 11,962 votes and was elected to the Commons, with a majority of 1,718 over Simon, and the coalition candidate trailing in a poor third place. The result was seen as sensational, with The Times describing it as a \"political event of great significance\" with voters deserting the government candidate in \"a humiliation which cannot be explained away\". The coalition finally fell in 1922, with a general election called for November. Myers defended his seat against Sir John Simon, now the Liberal candidate, and W O R Holton of the Conservative Party. Myers was defeated by Simon. He tried unsuccessfully to regain the seat in 1923 and 1924. He returned to Dewsbury Borough Council in 1935, and was the town's mayor in 1940–1941. He died in Dewsbury in 1949, aged 77."

Morgan is an insurance broker and cattle farmer from Pinehurst, North Carolina. In 2003, the House found itself evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. Morgan led a Republican faction that agreed to form a coalition with the Democrats. The coalition elected two \"co-speakers\" of the House for the first time in state history, for the North Carolina General Assembly of 2003-2004. Speaker Jim Black, a Democrat, was called the \"Democratic Speaker,\" and Morgan was called the \"Republican Speaker.\" A number of Republicans—but less than a majority of the Republican caucus—considered Morgan's actions tantamount to betraying his party. Rep. Morgan's actions gave him and Speaker Black control of redistricting in 2003, and allowed him to make some appointments to important committees. As Republican Leader, Morgan had also essentially run a statewide campaign leading to the election of five new Republicans and one loss for a net gain of five to help Republicans reach a majority. The state was said to have run more smoothly and more efficiently with the new leadership. Rep. Morgan was removed from the North Carolina Republican Party's Executive Committee in May 2004 for \"party disloyalty.\"  In the 2006 election he was defeated by a Republican opponent in the primary. In 2008, Morgan ran for North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction, losing to June Atkinson. In 2010, he ran for the State Senate but lost in the Republican primary to incumbent Harris Blake."

He briefly attended Western Carolina University before undergoing flight training at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and flying with the United States Navy during World War II (from 1943 to 1945). After the war, he graduated from the University of Virginia School of Consumer Banking and served as a bank executive in Franklin until his retirement. Carpenter married twice. His first wife, Ruth, died of cancer on September 15, 1985. Carpenter then married T. Helen Edwards Bryant on January 18, 1986. He had eight children with his first wife. He is the father-in-law of former North Carolina Representative Marge Carpenter (R). He was a member of the Franklin Rotary Club for 50 years. He died in 2011. After Carpenter's death in 2011, county commissioners unanimously approved a resolution Tuesday, March 18, 2014, to memorialize his life, with the county’s community building located on the Georgia Road to be known as the Robert C. Carpenter Community Facilities Building. Carpenter’s wife attended the meeting and was herself recognized for her service to the community. Carpenter worked in politics for much of his life, working on the local level as a county commissioner, and on a national level during eight terms as a North Carolina State Senator. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention. Locally, he served as President of the Franklin Chamber of Commerce and as Honorary Chairman for the Relay for Life. He worked on behalf of community colleges, serving 20 years on the Southwestern Community College Board of Trustees as well as President of the North Carolina Association of Community Colleges. Carpenter received many awards and recognitions including the State of North Carolina Distinguished Service Award, the NC Knights of Columbus Knight of the Year Award and Macon County Citizen of the Year recognition. He was a recipient of the Order of Long Leaf Pine Award, awarded by the governor of North Carolina. Carpenter spent many hours volunteering his time to baseball; he started Franklin’s Little League Baseball, coached Little League Baseball for 30 years, and was the first coach to recruit African Americans to play Little League Baseball in Asheville. For his work with baseball he received the Coach of the Year award and the Franklin Little League award. Carpenter was involved in many local organizations including the Optimist Club, Rotary Club, Jaycees and Knights of Columbus. He was on the Smokey Mountain Mental Health Board and served on the Governor’s NC Council on Developmental Disabilities.

He may have been born in Virginia or Ireland. He was descended from the ancient and illustrious Clan Lindsay of Scotland. Evidently, he lived for a time on the Pennsylvania/Maryland border area before coming to North Carolina in the mid-18th century. His name first appears in the North Carolina records in 1763. He died in 1801. Lindsay established a 2,000 acre (8 km²) plantation on Deep River in what later became Guilford County. In fact, when the county was formed in 1771, and until a court house could be built in 1774, the county court met in the \"great hall\" of his plantation home. The property included an ordinary (an inn/tavern), formal gardens, a mulberry grove for raising silk worms, a silk mill, a grist mill, and a store. A fragment of the original house remains. Robert Lindsay was a Captain in the North Carolina Militia. He served in the first independent North Carolina Legislature from 1777 to 1778, and was presiding Judge of Guilford County from 1781 to 1788. He was a well known and respected member of his community, and his descendants were prominent in the history of North Carolina. Robert married twice: 1."

In 1898, he won election to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on a moderate \"Liberal-Labour\" platform. He ran for Vancouver's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1900 federal election. Reports vary on whether he ran as an Independent Labour-Liberal candidate defeating the official Liberal and Conservative candidates, but once elected, he joined the Liberal caucus. He was re-elected in the 1904 and 1908 elections as a Liberal. He was defeated in the 1911 election. Smith subsequently returned to provincial politics and, returned to the provincial legislature in the 1916 provincial election that brought the British Columbia Liberal Party to power. Smith served as Minister of Finance in the government of Premier Harlan Carey Brewster, and died in office on February 17, 1917. His wife, Mary Ellen Smith, succeeded him in the subsequent by-election (held January 1918) as an Independent Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). She subsequently became the first female cabinet minister in the British Empire. Ralph Smith was a supporter of women's suffrage, which was enacted in the province shortly after the Liberals came to power after ten previous attempts over the years had failed."

He was re-elected unopposed at the resulting by-election in March 1853, and held his seat in the House of Commons until his death the following year, aged 45. Serving in the Crimean War, Boyle died of fever in Varna, and was buried at sea. He married Georgiana, daughter of Abraham Wildey Robarts, in 1844. They had one son and two daughters.

He subsequently moved to the Rhondda Valley, where he worked as a coalminer for ten years. From an early age he was involved in the local co-operative society and became a union official organising shop-assistants throughout South Wales. This led to his moving to Manchester, to take up a post with the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees and later the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers.

He retained the Westhoughton seat through successive elections until he retired from the House of Commons early in 1951 due to ill health. At the time he was the longest-serving Labour MP.Davies was a strong supporter of the temperance and pacifist movements, whose causes he advocated in Parliament and in the country. He was also a committed parliamentarian, and served as joint secretary of the British group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He married Margaret Griffiths in 1902, and they had three sons.

Aged only 23, his majority of 11% was a surprise, since Appleby had returned only Conservatives since 1885. However, Rigg resigned from the Liberal party in November 1904 because he found himself in agreement with the Conservative government on so many key issues. The Liberals then selected Leif Jones as their candidate for the imminent by-election, and although campaigning began before Christmas, there was as yet no vacancy. Rigg claimed that the \"ruffianism\" of Liberals angry at his defection of the party had made him ill, and he went to an unnamed continental health resort to recover. He returned to England in February 1905, and resigned his seat 11 February 1905 by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead, telling the annual dinner of the Carlisle Conservative Club \"I am proud to be one of you now ... I have the satisfaction of feeling that what I have done was conscientious and right.\" At the resulting by-election on 2 March 1905, Jones held the seat, though with a reduced majority. Rigg subsequently served as a councillor on Westminster City Council, representing Great Marlborough ward from February 1924 to November 1925, and St Margaret ward from February 1930 until his death. He was elected Mayor of Westminster for 1939–40. He was a member of the Municipal Reform Party, the local government wing of the Conservatives. He died at Hove, East Sussex in 1942, aged 65."

Davies was born at Llangefni, Anglesey, the son of Richard Davies, a merchant of Llangefni, and his wife Anne Jones of Coed Hywel. He was educated at Llangefni national school. When his father set up subsidiary businesses under the management of his three sons, Richard Davies was assigned to the old ferry-terminal of Porthaethwy, which was reconstituted as Menai Bridge. This timber importing business developed so successfully that all the family became involved and the business developed into large-scale ship-owning which generated considerable wealth, based to a large extent on guano.His brother, Robert, was renowned as a philanthropist. Davies became a notable figure in politics as a Welsh radical nonconformist. He stood as Liberal candidate for Caernarvon at the 1852 general election but lost by 93 votes. Davies was Anglesey's first Nonconformist J.P. and was High Sheriff of Anglesey in 1858. He was elected unopposed as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Anglesey in the election of 1868. He retained the seat till the 1886 general election, when he retired, being opposed to the proposal for Irish Home Rule. At one time Davies lived at Bwlch-y-fen, but afterwards at Treborth, opposite Menai Bridge and was a benefactor to Bangor Normal College and to the ‘British’ schools. He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Anglesey in 1884. Davies died at Treborth at the age of 77 and was buried in Llandysilio churchyard. Famously his final words are reputed to be \"cannot be fathomed\". A memorial to him is in the Menai Bridge English Presbyterian Church alongside memorials to other members of the family. ..(The Davies' family was closely associated with this church, it having been built at Robert's expense.) Davies married Anne Rees, daughter of Rev. Henry Rees of Liverpool and niece of William Rees in 1855 and had several children, one of whom was Henry Rees Davies."

Clifton was the son of Sir Juckes Granville Juckes-Clifton, 8th Baronet and his second wife Marianne Swinfen, daughter of John Swinfen of Swinfen, Staffordshire. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He succeeded his father to the baronetcy in 1852, but had to live for several years in France because of his debts from gambling and horse racing (see George Samuel Ford). In December 1861, Clifton was elected at a by-election as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham. He was re-elected at the 1865 general election, but his election was declared void on 20 April 1866. He was re-elected for Nottingham at the 1868 general election but died a year later at the age of 42 from typhoid fever. In 1868 building work began on the Clifton Colliery at Wilford after coal was found on the estate. The colliery opened in 1870 after Clifton's death, as did the Wilford Toll Bridge for which he was also responsible. Clifton married Geraldine Isabella O'Meara, daughter of Colonel John O'Meara, in 1863. They had no children and the baronetcy became extinct upon his death. The Clifton estates went to his cousin's son Henry Robert Markham."

At the 1945 general election he was the party's candidate for the south London suburban constituency of Norwood. The constituency had been held comfortably by the Conservatives since its creation in 1885, but a landslide in favour of Labour saw Chamberlain elected member of parliament, overturning a Conservative majority of 12,456 to win the seat by 2,023 votes. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of Town and Country Planning, Lewis Silkin. Chamberlain was regarded as a \"maverick\" member on the left wing fringe of the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was disciplined after voting against the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949. He also controversially accepted an invitation to visit Francoist Spain, returning with favourable reports on the régime. He narrowly avoided de-selection prior to the 1950 general election. When the election was held he was unseated, with the Conservatives regaining the seat. In 1971 he resigned from the Labour Party over its support for trade unions whose only purpose he claimed was the \"continual forcing up of wage rates, regardless of their less fortunate brothers and sisters and equally regardless of the public interest.\""

Pole was an unsuccessful candidate at four times: in East Grinstead at the 1918 general election; at the Edinburgh North by-election in 1920; in Cardiff South 1922 general election; and in Cardiff Central 1924 general election. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for South Derbyshire at the 1929 general election, but was defeated at the 1931 general election by the Conservative Party candidate Paul Emrys-Evans. Pole did not stand for Parliament again. He died in Marylebone aged 74. Pole was both a Fabian Society and a Theosophical Society activist. As such he defended Annie Besant's taking and retention of Jiddhu Krishnamurti and his brother Nityananda from their Indian magistrate father. Per James Webb, The Occult Underground (Open Court Press, 1974), Pole edited a Theosophical publication Theosophy in Scotland among his many Theosophical endeavors."

  "text" : "David Campbell (1750–1812) was a prominent politician and judge who was a member of the North Carolina state assembly, a leader in the State of Franklin, and a judge in the North Carolina Superior Court, Southwest Territory, and state of Tennessee. Born in Augusta County, Virginia, in 1750, Campbell rose to the rank of major while serving in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. In about 1783, sometime after the war had ended, he moved to Greene County, Tennessee, where he began practicing law. In 1785 he was elected Judge of the Superior Court of the State of Franklin. In 1787 he was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly and shortly thereafter was elected judge of the Superior Court of North Carolina, Washington District, a post he served in until 1790, when he was appointed to be a territorial state judge in the Southwest Territory by Governor William Blount. From 1797 until 1809 he served as a justice on the Superior Court of Tennessee, where he was twice impeached. His first impeachment came in 1798 during a dispute with Blount (who had himself just been impeached from the United States Senate), involving the Treaty of Holston; Campbell escaped conviction by one vote. Campbell was impeached again in 1803, having been charged with bribery, but was once again acquitted. Campbell died in Washington, Rhea County, Tennessee, in 1812."

In 1913 he was adopted as Liberal candidate for Southport for a General Election expected to take place in 1914 or 1915. However, the election was postponed due to the war. He became a Flight Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Air Services and was stationed in the Far East. He continued to nurse the Southport constituency while on leave in anticipation of being candidate when the election finally came. However, the Conservative MP for Southport, received endorsement from the Coalition Prime Minister Lloyd George, so the Southport Liberals decided not to run a candidate against him. He unsuccessfully contested the Walthamstow West constituency at the general elections in 1922 and 1923, before winning the seat at the 1924 general election, narrowly defeating the Labour MP Valentine McEntee. During the 1924-29 parliament which was dominated by a Unionist majority, Crawfurd worked closely with a group of radical Liberal MPs that included William Wedgwood Benn, Percy Harris, Joseph Kenworthy and Frank Briant to provide opposition to the government. However, McEntee regained the seat at the 1929 general election. He stood again at the Islington East by-election in February 1931, where he finished fourth. His last candidacy was at the 1935 general election, when he was placed third of the three candidates in Leicester West. In 1930, Elinor Glyn Ltd employed Crawfurd to undertake the publicity campaign for two movies: Knowing Men (1930), which experimented with a new colour process, and The Price of Things (1931). Crawfurd also worked with the author Elinor Glyn on her own personal publicity."

Henry Usborne was born in Leamington, Warwickshire, educated at Bradfield College and read Engineering at Cambridge. At the 1945 general election, He was elected Member of Parliament for Acocks Green. The constituency was then abolished and in 1950 Usborne was elected in the marginal constituency of Birmingham Yardley. He held the seat until the 1959 general election. According to his obituary in the Times on 19 March 1996, Usborne resigned from the Labour Party in 1962 and joined the Liberals. He urged former colleagues to join Jo Grimond's party as the best hope for defeating the Conservatives. There was a suggestion that Usborne be nominated to stand for the Liberal Party at Cheltenham but he announced that wild horses would not drag him into another Parliamentary contest. In addition to his work as a constituency MP Henry Usborne was one of the main drivers in the British branch of the World Federalist Movement. In 1947, ahead of the foundation of the United Nations, he co-founded the Parliamentary Group for World Government, which as All Party Parliamentary Group for World Governance (APPGWG) counts today (2008) 167 members and meets regularly to provide a forum for debate on global governance issues in the UK Parliament. In 1951 Henry Usborne set up the One World Trust as an independent educational Charity to provide secretarial support to the Group, promote and disseminate knowledge on world governance. In addition to its ongoing support for the APPGWG the One World Trust conducts independent research into the accountability of global organisations, political engagement of citizens at global level, and international law. He died in Evesham aged 86."

The son of George Hammond Whalley, Member of Parliament for Peterborough, he was born at the family estate of Plas Madoc in 1851. Educated at Brighton College and on the training ship Britannia, he afterwards entered the Royal Navy. Whalley received a lieutenant's commission in the 6th Royal Lancaster Regiment of Militia on 9 March 1871. He resigned his commission on 1 June 1872, and was commissioned a cornet in the Denbighshire Yeomanry on 29 June 1872. Whalley was promoted lieutenant, then captain on 4 December 1878. In 1879, Whalley commanded C Troop of Lonsdale's Horse, a local colonial unit, in the Anglo-Zulu War. A convoy under his command from Fort Tenedos to Fort Chelmsford successfully beat off a Zulu ambush. Whalley was elected Liberal MP for Peterborough in 1880, like his father (who had occupied the seat until his death in 1878). He resigned by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead in June 1883. He was adjudged bankrupt later that year. In April 1884, Whalley and his wife rented a house in South Kensington. They were evicted in August, after Whalley's draft for the rent had proved uncollectable, but by this time Whalley had broken into a locked room and stolen £200 of the owner's goods and pawned them. He was subsequently convicted of theft at the Old Bailey and sentenced to nine months at hard labor. He subsequently changed his surname to White, and emigrated to Queensland, with his wife and infant daughter, in 1885 or 1886. His later history is unknown."

He was the son of John Morison of Glasgow, and was educated at the city's academy and university.

Accordingly, in 1879 he moved to London, and in 1886 became a member of the London Stock Exchange. In 1876 Morison had married Josephine Ashton, member of a Manchester family of textile industrialists. He built up an expertise in the textile industry, and was a principal trader in the shares of J & P Coats, the Bradford Dyers Association and the English Sewing Cotton Company. Morison was politically a man of strong Liberal views. He was elected to the Croydon School Board, and was the party's parliamentary candidate at Lewes in 1906 and at Eastbourne in January and December, 1910. In May 1912, Horatio Bottomley, the controversial Liberal MP for Hackney South, was forced to his resign his seat when he was declared bankrupt. Bottomley had been unpopular with a large portion of the party's activists in Hackney, who had run their own candidate against him in December 1910. The two Liberal factions came together to nominate Morison for the vacancy. He was comfortably elected at the by-election held on 24 May. Morison served only one term as a member of the Commons. He chose to retire at the next general election in 1918. Horatio Bottomley, whose bankruptcy had been annulled, regained the Hackney South seat as an independent. Hector Morison played no further part in public life, living in quiet retirement. He died, aged 89, at his home \"Beechcroft\", Kenley, near Croydon, in June 1939."

He was the first of nine children of Theodore Titus, and Catharine Flick Howell. He was raised in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. He was enrolled for some time at the United States Military Academy at West Point, but did not graduate. In 1845, he was a postal inspector in Philadelphia. Titus was a leader of the Narciso López filibuster expeditions that invaded Cuba in 1850-1851. He was a grocer and sawmill operator in Jacksonville, until migrating with his family to \"Bleeding Kansas\" in April 1856 to join pro-slavery forces. He resided at \"Fort Titus,\" a double-log cabin one mile south of Lecompton, that came under artillery attack from John Brown's raiders on Aug. 16, 1856. He was wounded, captured, and exchanged for Free-State prisoners, before joining filibuster William Walker in Nicaragua in Feb. 1857. After his force was defeated at Castillo Viejo a few weeks later, Titus went to New York. He and his brother Elliot moved to the Sonoita Valley, Arizona, where they operated various ore mines during 1858-1860. Titus returned to Jacksonville during the American Civil War and served as assistant quartermaster in the Florida Militia. He was also working for the Florida Provision Company, a business owned by his father-in-law, Edward S. Hopkins. The firm sold supplies to the Confederate Army. While transporting a load of Confederate draft dodgers to Nassau in 1863, Titus lost his steamer to the Northern blockade and was captured on the Indian River. He eluded imprisonment and later returned to Florida with his family, preceding a post-war wave of newcomers. He moved to New York with his family in 1865, but returned to Florida in November 1867, settling at Sand Point which at that time had a population of 250. Titus built a sawmill, general store and hotel at that location. Titus was appointed postmaster, and soon thereafter renamed the settlement \"Titusville.\" The name of Titusville was determined by a dominoes game with Captain Clark Rice on October 16, 1873. He lobbied tirelessly to have Titusville named as county seat. His efforts were realized on October 7, 1879 when a vote was taken and the result supported relocation of the county seat to Titusville. He was also the Justice of the Peace, a notary public for Volusia County, and a marine insurance underwriter's agent. Rheumatic gout kept him confined to a wheelchair during the last years of his life."

He moved to France with his wife (Janet) and daughter (Suzannah) in the late 1990s and died at his home there, aged 66, just before Christmas 1997. Following his death, his sister, Jean, persuaded the General Synod of the Church of England to permit a stained glass window to be installed in his memory at St Mary's Church in Harlington, Bedfordshire, the village where they had lived for some time during childhood. The window, designed by Petri Anderson, was dedicated in May 2009. Clemitson co-wrote \"A Life to Live: Beyond Full Employment\" (Junction Books, 1981) with George Rogers MP. Clemitson House, a municipal building in the centre of Luton, is named in memory of Clemitson and his father (Daniel), who had served as an alderman on the local council. Clemitson was a lifelong supporter of Luton Town Football Club."

Cawley was buried in Néry Communal Cemetery. Shortly before his death in 1918, Cawley had been elected in a by-election in January to succeed his father as Member of Parliament (MP) for Prestwich. It was in memory of Oswald and two other sons - Harold and John - who died in the war that their father endowed a ward at Ancoats Hospital, Manchester, in 1919 at a cost of £10,000. All three brothers are commemorated on the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall. Oswald and Harold, on Panel 8, are among the 22 MPs that died during World War I to be named on that memorial. John, included on the memorial as the son of an MP, appears on Panel 2 of the memorial. Oswald Cawley is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes short biographical accounts of the life and death of the Cawley brothers."

He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardiganshire at a by-election in 1932, following the resignation of the Liberal MP Rhys Hopkin Morris. Evans held the seat until his sudden death, probably of heart failure, shortly before the 1945 general election. His death robbed him of becoming a Knight Bachelor; his appointment had been announced in the Dissolution Honours List published on 7 June 1945 but he died before he could be knighted. In public life in Wales he was a member of the Councils of the University colleges of Aberystwyth and Swansea, treasurer of the college at Aberystwyth and of the National Museum of Wales. He was also a governor and member of the Council of the National Library of Wales."

Selected for officer training he served in Poland and Belgium before coming to the Channel Islands, as commander of Company 6 Infantry Regiment 583. He took office the day after the German occupation, deposing Sibyl Hathaway as the most senior authority in the island with the title Inselkommandant Sark. During his tenure, Operation Basalt took place, in which three prisoners were killed by British commandos, in one case because the prisoner began shouting to alert nearby German soldiers, and in the other cases the prisoners were killed while attempting to escape during an attack by German forces. Nazi propaganda obscured the details of the event and portrayed it as the execution of prisoners. Herdt was replaced as commander in Sark and reportedly Herdt was to face a court martial but for the reaction by Hitler to the deaths.The raid prompted Hitler to issue an order calling for all British commandos to be summarily executed. Herdt returned as commander in Sark after the death of Johann Hinkel in March 1943."

It was rumored that an anonymous buyer wanted to buy the stones and take them to the United States; if Antrobus had accepted the offer, no one could have stopped him.

Born in Birkenhead to Joseph Allen and his wife Edith (née Scholefield), he was educated at Birkenhead Institute and Liverpool University, from where he graduated with first class honours in law. He served with the Royal Artillery during the First World War, and subsequently was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn. Practising in criminal law, his most famous brief was the sensational 1931 Liverpool murder case, acting as junior counsel for William Herbert Wallace, assisting Roland Oliver KC, who led for the Defence. Wallace was initially convicted of the bizarre murder of his wife Julia, and sentenced to death, but in a unique legal decision the verdict was quashed on Appeal, because the weight of the evidence did not support it, and Wallace was freed. Scholefield Allen was appointed a Kings Counsel in June 1945. He served as Recorder of Blackburn between 1947 and 1970. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Crewe at the 1945 general election, defeating the Conservative Home Secretary, Sir Donald Somervell, and held the seat until he retired at the February 1974 general election, a month before his death. His successor as MP was Gwyneth Dunwoody."

The circumstances of his death were as follows. On Sunday, 7 December 1958, Dye joined protesters blockading the airbase, at Swaffham, in his constituency - the intended site of intermediate range nuclear missiles. On Monday, 8 December, he travelled to the House of Commons to table a question regarding the protests. On the morning of Tuesday, 9 December 1958 Sidney Dye was killed in a head-on collision with another vehicle near his home in Swaffham.

Swann became a merchant in Manchester, and became a leading member of the Liberal movement in the city. He was, by turn, the secretary, treasurer and president of the Manchester Liberal Federation. He was also president of the Manchester Reform Club and for nine years president of the National Reform Union. In 1885 he was the unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the new constituency of Manchester North. However, another general election was held in the following year, and Swann was elected as member of parliament. He was to remain Manchester North's MP until 1918. He was regarded as an \"advanced radical\", and took an interest in the constitutional affairs of India, attending the opening of the National Indian Congress in 1890. In 1906 Charles Schwann was created a baronet \"of Prince's Gardens in the Royal Borough of Kensington\" and in 1911 he was as appointed to the Privy Council.

He served as Justice of the Peace for the county of London. In 1889 he stood as a candidate for the newly formed London County Council for the Progressive Party, the municipal wing of the Liberal Party. He contested Whitechapel, and was elected with 1,523 votes, along with his running mate, Charles Tarling, who polled 1,477 votes. He served for one term, before standing down in 1892. Samuel was selected as Liberal candidate for Whitechapel in 1900, in succession to his uncle Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling, who had been the MP. He knew the constituency well, having represented it on the LCC. He held the seat for the Liberals with an increased majority. When the Liberal Party won the 1906 election with a landslide, he was again returned at Whitechapel. The Liberal Party faced the elections in 1910 against a resurgent Conservative Party. Despite this challenge, Samuel was re-elected with an increased majority, at both 1910 elections. Over the course of four general election campaigns in Whitechapel, Samuel had increased the Liberal share of the vote each time, taking it from 50.4% to 59.2%, changing the constituency from a marginal to a safe seat. In 1912 he was created Sir Stuart Samuel, Baronet of Chelwood Vetchery. In April 1913 he undertook a contract for the Government, which required him to resign his seat and face re-election at a by-election. His Conservative opponent from 1910 ran against him in the by-election. He was re-elected with a reduced majority. Samuel retired from politics in 1916."

Hoare left Stourhead and lived in France in his later years where he fell ill in 1894. He returned to London and died at the age of 70 at 12, West Eaton Place, Pimlico and was buried at Stourton.

Despite later assertions that McKay was born in 1911, she was in fact born on 22 January 1907 at Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, a daughter of Joseph and Betsy Ann (Catlow) McCarthy. McKay's family moved to New Bedford, Connecticut in her youth, but then returned to England. McKay joined the Independent Labour Party's Guild of Youth, then the Young Communist League, graduating to the Communist Party of Great Britain. She left the party in 1932, joining the Labour Party. She also became general secretary of the National Union of Domestic Workers. After holding various trade union posts, McKay stood unsuccessfully for Labour in Walthamstow East at the 1959 general election. At the 1964 general election, she defeated the sitting Conservative MP Alan Glyn for Clapham, taking the seat with a majority of only 556. At the 1966 election she increased her majority to over 4,000 against the Conservative Ian Gow, but she stood down at the 1970 general election, when the seat was won by the Conservative William Shelton. While in Parliament, McKay became a supporter of Arab interests, creating a mock Palestinian refugee camp in Parliament Square and wearing Arab robes during debates. Jordan issued a postage stamp in her honour. After retiring from politics, McKay moved to Abu Dhabi."

He served many years on the backbenches, he enlisted in the Second World War and served with distinction during the war, gaining promotion to lieutenant colonel and receiving the Distinguished Service Order for his service. Returning to politics, he had missed the foundation of the Liberal Party of Australia in 1945. When long-time Leader Vernon Treatt resigned the leadership in 1954 and contests between Deputy Leader Robert Askin and Pat Morton became deadlocked he was asked to stand and was consequently elected as party leader and Leader of the Opposition. He served little more than a year before he was deposed by Pat Morton. In 1957 he retired from politics and returned to his legal career before retiring. He died of a heart attack in August 1974."

  "text" : "Lieutenant Colonel Sir Michael Frederick Bruxner KBE, DSO, JP (25 March 1882 – 28 March 1970) was an Australian politician and soldier, serving for many years as Leader of the Country Party and its predecessors. Born in Tabulum in Northern New South Wales, Bruxner was educated at The Armidale School and started studies at University of Sydney but later dropped out to take up employment as a grazier and station agent in Tenterfield. After serving in the Citizen Military Forces from 1911, Bruxner enlisted into the Australian Light Horse upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Serving with distinction in Gallipoli, Egypt and Palestine, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Returning to Australia in 1919, Bruxner sold his business and joined the Progressive Party, being elected to the Parliament of New South Wales for Northern Tablelands at the 1920 election. Bruxner came to political prominence when he led the rural \"True Blues\" faction of the Progressive Party that went against their Leader's decision to form a coalition in Sir George Fuller's short-lived government in 1921. Bruxner emerged as the leader of the reduced Progressive Party, which consisted of the members of his faction, but they nevertheless joined with Fuller's Nationalists to form government in 1922. Bruxner also became involved in the New England New State Movement. Bruxner resigned the party leadership, now for the renamed Country Party, at the end of 1925. At the 1927 election, with the abandonment of proportional representation, he won the new seat of Tenterfield unopposed. Bruxner was included in new Premier Thomas Bavin's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, which included the responsibility for transport. He served until Labor won the 1930 election. In April 1932 Bruxner was elected again as the new party Country Party Leader, which he would hold continuously until 1958. When Sir Philip Game dismissed Jack Lang and called upon the Leader of the Opposition Bertram Stevens to form a caretaker government in 1932, Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Bruxner was also sworn in as Minister for Transport and briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio. Bruxner also worked with his long-time friend and Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish the New England University College in 1938, which was later to become the University of New England. Bruxner was central in ensuring Alexander Mair became Premier after Stevens was defeated in the house in August 1939. The Coalition lost government at the 10 May 1941 election and Bruxner would never again serve in government. The rest of Bruxner's parliamentary career was to be on the opposition benches, leading the Country Party through five more elections and through the instability of the larger opposition parties that eventually united as the Liberal Party of Australia. On 6 May 1958, Bruxner formally resigned as Leader of the Country Party, having served continuously in that role since 1932. He continued to serve in his capacity as Member for Tenterfield for one more term before retiring from politics before the 1962 election. Bruxner was Knighted as a KBE in 1962 and thereafter served in various capacities on boards and continued his passion for horses before his death aged 88 on 28 March 1970."

A University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill graduate, Marie Watters married Henry E. Colton. The couple first lived in Chapel Hill and later in Asheville. After her husband, an Asheville City Councilman, declined to run for state office, Marie Colton campaigned and won the seat. During her sixteen years of service, Colton focused on such issues as conservation and environmentalism, billboards, alternative medicine, tax reform, historic preservation, tourism and economic development in western North Carolina, child welfare protection, domestic violence laws, legislative ethics reform, and allowing local school boards to ban corporal punishment. Colton, a Democrat, was the first female Speaker Pro Tempore of the House, serving in that role from 1991 to 1994. In recognition of her advocacy of women and children's issues, Colton was appointed to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in 1994. Colton was inducted into the North Carolina Women's Hall of Fame in 2009."

Fern Shubert was one of the candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination to challenge Governor Mike Easley in the 2004 election. The sole woman in a field of six contenders for the GOP nomination, Shubert campaigned as an outsider to the party establishment, but placed fifth in the primary, gathering only 4% of votes cast. Shubert ran to return to her old Senate seat in 2010. She lost the Republican primary on May 4 to Tommy Tucker. In 2012, Shubert filed to run for North Carolina State Auditor."

Born in Manchester, Allaun was educated at Manchester Grammar School and worked as an engineer, shop assistant, tour leader, chartered accountant and journalist. He helped to organise the first Aldermaston March in 1958 and was chair of the Labour Peace Fellowship. Allaun was against British membership of the EEC. Allaun contested Manchester Moss Side in 1951. He was Member of Parliament for Salford East from 1955 to 1983. He was a veteran of leftwing causes, especially the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), of which he was vice president from 1983. He was the first President of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy in 1973. Allaun wrote several books on nuclear weapons including Stop the H-Bomb Race (1959) and The Wasted 30 Billions (1975). Naive or optimistic, or just unappreciative of war culture, Allaun was a straight up-and-down idealist. His style was intensely gentle, the voice never raised, but the questions - chiefly on peace and housing - insistent. The beautiful manners and the soft Lancashire voice must have got on ministerial nerves. But then, as one of the organisers of the first Aldermaston march, he helped launch a movement whose appeal in the late 1950s and 1960s did more than get on nerves. Outside the peace movement, his preoccupation was with public housing, and the vastly increased expenditure he urged should be paid for by cuts, equally massive, in defence. Defence cuts would, of course, come, but, despite Allaun's life work, Britain remained a nuclear power. Frank Allaun retired from the House of Commons in 1983 but continued to be active in politics. This included writing the books Spreading the News: A Guide To Media Reform (1989) and The Struggle for Peace (1992). His recreations were walking and swimming. His first wife died in 1986, and on 3 June 1989 he married Millicent (Millie) Bobker, née Greenberg, a widow and retired civil servant. He died in Manchester in 2002 aged 89. His second wife, son and daughter survived him."

He married his wife, Muriel, in 1943, and was demobilised as a warrant officer in 1948. He returned to Liverpool and worked as a salesman for Fitzpatricks (a wholesale greengrocer and flower merchant), as a crane driver in Liverpool Docks, and then as a telephonist for the General Post Office. He joined the Labour party in 1948, and became member of Liverpool City Council for the St Domingo ward in 1964. He lost his seat in 1967, but was re-elected for the Vauxhall ward in 1969. He resigned from the council when he was elected as MP for Liverpool Scotland in a by-election held in April 1971, after the sitting Labour MP Walter Alldritt had resigned to become regional secretary of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers. Marsden had previously served at Alldritt's agent. In Parliament, Marsden was a strong supporter of comprehensive schools. Marsden's constituency was merged with the neighbouring Liverpool Exchange for the February 1974 general election, and Robert Parry won the selection for the new Liverpool Scotland Exchange seat. Marsden returned to his job at the GPO. He remained a loyal supporter of the Labour Party, and was later elected as a councillor on Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council and Merseyside County Council. He disagreed with the Militant tendency in the 1980s. His wife died in 2001, but Marsden was survived by their three sons. He died in Liverpool."

He married Elizabeth, a daughter of the late Caleb Coffin of New York on 11 July 1895. They had 3 children, John (1898), Marjorie (1901) and Barbara (1903). Franklin contested the Westhoughton Parliamentary division in 1900, and Stretford in 1901, but on both occasions he was unsuccessful. He became Liberal MP for Leicester at a by-election in 1906, however, sharing the representation of the double-member constituency with Ramsay MacDonald. He retired at the January 1910 election. In 1906, Thomasson ventured on a bold but disastrous experiment in newspaper production by founding the Tribune (1906–1908). He played a large part in local political life before he left Bolton for London. During World War I he commanded the 2-5th Battalion Loyal North Lancashire Regiment. His wife Elizabeth died in 1927 and he then married Gertrude Prescott. They had three children, Margaret (1930), Christopher (1932) and Jenny (1937). Franklin died of cancer on 29 October 1941 aged 68 and was buried at Lyndhurst, Hampshire."

He also ran for U.S. Senator for Wisconsin in the 1938 election.

In the Governor's race in 1974, he received 3,617 votes. Blair and his wife Mary ran \"Mary's Bookshop\" in Milwaukee for 13 years; Blair was well known for his poetry and love of literature. In November 1966, there was an attempt on Blair's life when a 17-year-old Brookfield Wisconsin youth entered Mary's Bookshop and tried to shoot Blair with a handgun. Blair was not wounded although a customer in the store was shot during a scuffle with the assailant."

He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Evesham at a by-election in July 1880, by a majority of only two votes. A petition was lodged and the result voided. Scrutiny of the votes led to his opponent Frederick Dixon-Hartland being declared the winner in January 1881, with a majority of one vote. Lehmann married Nina Chambers, daughter of Dr Robert Chambers of Edinburgh. Their social circle included Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Robert Browning, Lord Leighton, and other prominent figures. Their sons were Rudolf Chambers Lehmann (a Liberal politician), Frederick Hope Lehmann and Ernest Benzon Lehmann. They had one daughter, Nina Frederika Mary Teba Lehmann, who married Sir Guy Theophilus Campbell. His son Frederick had an affair with the actress Minnie Duncan (whose sister was much better known as an actress - Emily Mary Duncan) Their two sons Frederic Archibald Duncan (1884) and John (Jack) Lehmann Duncan (1886) may not have known the identity of their father (who signed the register for their baptisms as 'Frederic Duncan, Gentleman' . Minnie lived in a large house with servants in London - and the census noted her as 'Minnie Lehmann' - single. Minnie married Lt Col Hugh Charles Fortescue in 1892. Lehmann died at the age of 65."

His family came to England during the French revolution. As an industrialist, he developed Muntz Metal. Muntz was a supporter of political reform and a member of the Birmingham Political Union. In his actions that led to the Reform Act of 1832, he was indicted for sedition as he tried to undermine the Duke of Wellington with a run on gold: To stop the Duke, run for gold. He also was involved in a riot at Saint Martins in Birmingham in protest against the Church Rates which were levied at around 6d to 9d in the pound. He was sent to trial in 1838, but was acquitted on all but one of 13 charges. Whilst claiming to be a republican, his true character appeared to be that of an egotistical aristocrat. Edwards wrote in 1877 of a conversation about a speech he made: \"They won't be able to print Muntz's speech verbatim.\" \"Why not?\" said I. \"Why my dear fellow, no printing office in the world would have capital I's enough\". His home was at Umberslade Hall, in Tanworth in Arden. In the grounds of his estate, Muntz's son commissioned a church to be built which stands to this day, Umberslade Baptist Church. His descendants still live in the area and operate Umberslade Hall Children's Farm. He had seven sons and two daughters. The family business was continued by the eldest son, George Frederick junior together with Philip Albert Muntz, also a Member of Parliament who was created a Baronet in 1902 (see Muntz Baronets). George's brother, Philip Henry Muntz, was also an MP. One son, William Henry Muntz, designed a new type of paddle wheel. The Muntz family are remembered by Muntz Street, a tower block called Muntz House and Muntz Park, all in Birmingham."

The mausoleum is in the form of a small Gothic chapel with coloured marble, suggesting a north Italian inspiration for the design, and is now a Grade II listed building. It has been suggested that Dodd had bought sixteen houses designed by Thomas Allom in Kensington Park Gardens and wanted his mausoleum to be designed by the same architect."

  "text" : "Philip Christian Koperberg AO AFSM BEM (born 28 April 1943), is the Chairman of the New South Wales Emergency Management Committee, responsible for advising the New South Wales government on emergency response strategies, since 2011. Koperberg is a former Australian politician, was the New South Wales Minister for Climate Change, Environment and Water between 2007 and 2008; and was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, representing the electorate of the Blue Mountains for the Australian Labor Party between 2007–2011. Prior to his political career, Koperberg was the Commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) in Australia between 1997–2007. \"An expert in risk and crisis management, Phil Koperberg was the overall emergency controller during the 2001 Christmas/New Year fires, when Australia faced its longest and most intense bush firefighting campaign. In 1994 Phil Koperberg was also the overall emergency controller, as firefighters battled to control over 800 New South Wales fires covering in excess of 800,000 hectares. In 1999, his expertise was again called upon during the severe hail storms which damaged more than 30,000 properties.\" In September 1997, Koperberg was appointed the RFS Commissioner when the Service was formed under the Rural Fires Act. Before this he had been Director-General of the New South Wales Bush Fire Service from May 1990. In March 2007 he was elected to State parliament and appointed to the Ministry. However, in December he was forced to stand aside due to a police investigation regarding domestic violence allegations from 1987. The NSW Director of Public Prosecutions declined to press charges and Koperberg was reinstated to the Ministry. He resigned from the Ministry on 22 February 2008. Koperberg did not recontest the 2011 state election."

He took the Labour whip in Parliament, ahead of any decision of Co-operative Congress to progress a formal alliance with the Labour Party. Waterson was defeated at the 1922 general election. He became a national organiser of the Co-operative Party, serving until 1945. He contested the Nottingham Central by-election in 1930, and stood in Nottingham Central at the 1931 general election, coming a distant second in each case. He died in Wood Green, London aged 84."

The same year instructions had been received from the Company to abandon the island. Most Dutch families were transported on two ships to Cape Town, where they arrived on January 26, 1709. After destroying everything they could not take with them, to prevent the abandoned station to be of service to anyone else, Momber and his garrison left on January 25, 1710 to Batavia on the ship Beverwaart.

During the 1911 transport strike, he was prominent in leading the successful campaign for union recognition by the railway companies. When the ASRS was merged with two other rail unions in 1913 to form the National Union of Railwaymen, Bellamy was its first president, serving until 1917. From 1917 to 1927 he was a member of the War Pensions Appeal Tribunal. He made his home at Stockport, Cheshire, where he was president of the local Trades Council and Labour Party, as well serving as a magistrate. He stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party at Wakefield at the 1918 and 1922 general elections. He eventually entered the Commons when he was elected member of parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne at a by-election in October 1928, after the sitting Conservative MP Cornelius Homan was disqualified when he was declared bankrupt. Bellamy was re-elected at the 1929 general election. Following the election, the Second Labour Government was formed, and he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to F O Roberts, Minister of Pensions. Soon after entering government, Bellamy became ill and died, at Wandsworth, in March 1931, aged 60. The by-election for his seat was won by the Conservative candidate John Broadbent."

He was re-elected in 1929, but when Labour split at the 1931 general election as Ramsay MacDonald led the breakaway National Labour group into a Conservative-dominated National Government, he lost his seat to the Conservative candidate Charles Peat. He stood again in 1935, but lost again by a margin of over 10% of the votes."

The Buckley family owned two cotton mills in Ashton: Ryecroft and Oxford Road, and Abel became involved in the business. At his death he was described as \"one of the old cotton lords of Lancashire\". In 1885 Buckley inherited Ryecroft Hall, Audenshaw, from his uncle, James Smith Buckley, and was to live there for the rest of his life. He subsequently inherited Galtee Castle, near Mitchelstown, County Cork. The estate had been purchased by his uncle, Nathaniel Buckley, MP for Stalybridge in 1873. In 1885 Abel Buckley was elected Liberal MP for the newly created Prestwich constituency. In the general election of the following year, however, he was defeated. Apart from his interests in the cotton industry, Buckley was a director and chairman of the Manchester and Liverpool District Banking Company and a justice of the peace. He was a collector of fine art, and a racehorse breeder. He died at Ryecroft Hall on 23 December 1908, aged 73."

He was nominated as the Labour Party candidate for the Manchester constituency of Hulme with the support of the woodworkers' union, but failed to win the seat at the 1924 general election. In 1925 he was chairman of the Dumbarton and Clydebank Labour Party, and gave evidence to an enquiry into the Clydebank Rents Strike. McElwee again stood at Hulme at the 1929 general election, and was elected. However, he became involved in a dispute with his sponsoring union, who refused to support him at the ensuing election in 1931. The Divisional Labour Party asked him to stand down as candidate, but he refused to do, and after a search for a replacement candidate he received the Labour nomination. He was defeated, with the Conservative Party regaining the constituency. In February 1932 the executive council and a number of officials of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers issued summonses alleging criminal libel against the former MP. The allegations centred on statements made in four letters written by McElwee about the union. The letters accused identifiable officials of corruption and of misappropriation of expenses. In May 1932 he entered a plea of guilty to the charges and was bound over to keep the peace on his personal recognisance of £100."

  "text" : "Alexander Johnson Irwin (March 1, 1799 – June 14, 1847) was an American pioneer, businessman, and territorial legislator. Born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania on March 1, 1799, Irwin moved with his family to Detroit, Michigan Territory and then to Green Bay, Michigan Territory in 1823. Irwin and his brother Robert Irwin, Jr. were in the mercantile business in Green Bay. In 1827 he married Frances Pamelia Smith, with whom he had seven children. In 1836, he served in the Wisconsin Territorial House of Representatives and then in the Wisconsin Territorial Council. In 1845, he was appointed receiver of the Green Bay Land Office. The position required trips on horseback to Saint Louis, Missouri to deposit funds because there were no banks in Green Bay at the time. His extensive travel duties led to an infection in his arm, which resulted in his death. Irwin died in Green Bay in 1847 while still in office. Elisha Morrow was appointed receiver to fill the vacancy left by Irwin."
