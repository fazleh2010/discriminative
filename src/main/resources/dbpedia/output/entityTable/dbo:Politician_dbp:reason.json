Laws was also a co-host on the Internet show Every Way Woman from 2008 - December 2013, and she hosted her own Los Angeles TV show called Uncommon Sense from October 2007 until September 2010. Laws and her guests discussed news and current events. Laws is a former member of the Greater Valley Glen Council in Valley Glen, California. She was termed out of office in 2012, after serving four two-year terms. She was the first politician to run on the platform that she represents all beings in her district, not just the humans whom she maintains are the elite. She promotes moving from a democracy to what she calls an omniocracy, a government with representation for all living beings. In May 2006, Laws was appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to serve on the city’s 912 Commission, which was also called the Neighborhood Council Review Commission. In 1999, the Los Angeles City Charter mandated that a commission would be formed seven years later to review the progress, successes and failures of the city’s Neighborhood Council system. Laws is the founder and president of two organizations: the Directors of Animal Welfare (DAW) and the League for Earth and Animal Protection (LEAP). In 2006, Laws was the recipient of the Los Angeles Animal Humanitarian Award. Laws is a vegan and an advocate of that diet."
