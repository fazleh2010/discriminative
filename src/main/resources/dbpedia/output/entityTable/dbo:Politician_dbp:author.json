  "text" : "Brian O'Higgins (Irish: Brian Ó hUigínn; 1 July 1882 – 10 March 1963), also known as Brian na Banban, was an Irish poet, Sinn Féin politician and a founding member of the organisation. He was President of Sinn Féin from 1931 to 1933. He took part in the 1916 Easter Rising and was present in the GPO during the rebellion. O'Higgins wrote the notable anti-recruitment poem Who Is Ireland's Enemy? -- he was elected unopposed as a Sinn Féin MP for Clare West at the 1918 general election. In January 1919, Sinn Féin MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called Dáil Éireann. Higgins was re-elected as an anti-Treaty Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) at the 1921, 1922 and 1923 elections. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted against it. He lost his seat at the June 1927 general election."
