However, on March 16, 2012, Galloway announced her resignation from office due to health issues in her family, leaving the Senate evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Galloway's seat was filled in the recall election, which had already been scheduled. She was succeeded by fellow Republican Jerry Petrowski. Galloway relocated to Warsaw, Indiana where she announced in May 2015 that she would make a bid for the United States House of Representatives and run for Marlin Stutzman's seat in Indiana's 3rd congressional district. As of July 2015 she raised $51,423 in campaign contributions, with $50,000 coming from loans she made to herself."
