  "text" : "Sabina Yasmin is an Indian politician and a former Minister of State for Labour in the Government of West Bengal. She is an MLA, elected from the Mothabari constituency in the West Bengal state assembly election, 2011. Sabina Yasmin's victory from Mothabari constituency was particularly creditable because Shehnaz Quadery, a niece of A. B. A. Ghani Khan Choudhury contested the seat as an independent candidate. Sabina Yasmin was the first Muslim woman to be a minister in West Bengal. She was one of the seven Muslim woman MLAs in the West Bengal Vidhan Sabha. She resigned as a minister when the Congress party decided to pull out of the Mamata Banerjee government."

She won the Indian general election, 2014 as a All India Trinamool Congress candidate. The BJP had lodged a complaint with the Election Commission seeking cancellation of the candidature of Aparupa Poddar on the plea that she had converted to Islam and hence she could not be treated as one belonging to the scheduled caste. Aparupa Poddar had clarified that she had changed her name but not her religion. The Arambagh constituency has a seat reserved for scheduled castes."
