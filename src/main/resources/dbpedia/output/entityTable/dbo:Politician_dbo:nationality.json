Since then many of the houses have been renovated and the neighbourhood is now gentrified and upscale. Jaffary ran for Toronto City Council and became alderman for Ward 7 in 1969. As senior alderman, he sat on both the city and Metro Toronto councils. He was re-elected in 1972 but decided not to run in the 1974 election.

He was elected to the City of Canterbury council in 1973, and served as deputy mayor in 1976 and 1979 before being elected by his colleagues as mayor in 1980. He served as mayor until the year after his election to parliament, and was employed as a staffer at the party's head office during his period. Moss won Labor preselection to contest the state seat of Canterbury in 1986 when the appointment of former Labor minister Kevin Stewart as the state's Agent-General in London created the need for a by-election. Canterbury was considered a safe seat for the Labor Party, and Moss was elected with over 53% of the primary vote. He was re-elected four times as the member for Canterbury, and served as a parliamentary secretary in the first two terms of the Carr government. Moss retired at the 2003 election, and was succeeded by Labor member Linda Burney."

Sacilotto owned Professionals Darwin and had worked in Residential & Commercial real estate prior to her political career, and was also Vice President of the REINT. Sacilotto was one of the surprise victors of Labor's 2005 landslide election win, defeating the Country Liberal Party incumbent Sue Carter. Although Carter had suffered a 10-point swing in 2001, there was little hint that she was in any serious danger of losing what had long been the safest CLP seat in Darwin. However, in a shock result, the count remained on a knife-edge for several days after the election. On the final count, Sacilotto unseated Carter by 73 votes on a swing of 8.4 percent, just barely enough to take the seat off the CLP. She served one term in the Assembly before John Elferink regained Port Darwin for the CLP."

  "text" : "Keshav Dev Malaviya (1904–1981) was a leader of Indian National Congress and a union minister of India. He was a member of Lok Sabha from Domariyaganj, Uttar Pradesh.Founder of ONGC, Shri KD Malaviya ji is beyond a shadow of any doubt, the unqualified father of the hydrocarbon sector of this country.Undeterred by strong western skepticism about the viability or, even the potential, of the country’s hydrocarbon capabilities which was largely a propaganda driven by the western oil companies, Mr. Malaviya, the original one among the rich lineage of visionaries of the country’s oil & gas industry of which there has been quite a few, was undaunted in his vision and unrelenting in his pursuit of a country that was energy-secure.However, with support from Jawaharlal Nehru, Malaviya launched a crusade for the formation of a national oil company with formation of ONGC in 1956. In fact, most of what Mr. Malaviya achieved, with the unstinted support of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, in those early days of Nehru’s national project of modernizing the nation and making it industrially competent has, over the years, provided and continues to provide a strong foundation to the economic success story that India is today. His commitment to India's progress for gaining self-reliance in energy sector was a shining example of the patriotism for the younger generation and a source of strength to the scientific community. Clear in his thoughts and supremely purposeful in his action, he was an inspiration for the younger generation of that era to come together in the hunt to find oil and secure the country’s future."

He served as the Speaker of the Madras Legislative Assembly from 1955 to 1956. Soon after the untimely death of his father (Ulanat Mootha Pannicker, a chieftain of the Zamorin of Calicut), Gopal’s mother with her six small children moved to Madras (the erstwhile Madras Presidency ). Gopal did his schooling and higher studies in the Madras Christian College High School and graduate studies at Madras Christian College and the Law College, Madras. After qualifying in Law he joined the Legal firm of Sir Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu who became his mentor. Sir KV Reddy, was the first Indian to be appointed Governor of a Presidency, when he became the Governor of the Madras Presidency in June 1936. Gopala Menon set up his private law practice in Madras in the early 1920s, getting a good start from the extensive practice of Sir Reddy, a part of which was turned over to him. Always a person who was sympathetic to the conditions of the under-privileged, Gopala Menon devoted his legal practice to the requirements of the needy. He virtually adopted a large cluster of poor households in Vepery and Choolai districts for whom he provided free legal service. He represented this Municipal constituency in the Madras Corporation for nearly twenty years from the early 1930s. During his Membership of the Madras Corporation he was for many terms the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance and other important Committees, and was elected the Deputy Mayor for a term. He was elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly in 1952, (see Madras Legislative Assembly election, 1952) from the Ponnani constituency in the South Malabar district of Madras Presidency . This was a landmark victory as in these elections, the Communist Party of India and the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party had made a strong showing and his was one of only 5 victories for the INC out of 31 constituencies in what later became Kerala state. In September 1955 he was elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Madras State (see List of Speakers of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly), the precursor of the present Tamil Nadu state. He was only the second person to occupy this office, following the first ever Speaker of the newly created Madras State J. Shivashanmugam Pillai who served from May 1952 to August 1955. He published a book on Parliamentary Practices, which served as a handbook for newly elected law makers, who were unfamiliar with the subject."

In 2000 he was National Welfare Officer for the National Union of Students as a member of the Australian Labor Students, and in 2001 became an electorate officer for federal Labor MP Lindsay Tanner, transferring to Senator Gavin Marshall in 2002. In 2004 he became a state organiser with the Victorian Labor Party, and in 2007 moved to the Plumbing Trades Employees Union as a community organiser, a position he held until his appointment to the Legislative Council in 2010. Murphy was involved in the controversial round of ALP preselections in 2006 in Victoria, where he challenged sitting member and future Speaker of the House Harry Jenkins for the safe Labor Division of Scullin. One journalist wrote that \"the choice of Murphy was so wrong-headed that even some of the Labor Unity people who negotiated the deal were embarrassed by it.\" In the lead up to the 2010 Victorian Election, Murphy held a $500 a head fundraiser at a Melbourne apartment. The event gained media attention when the apartment was subsequently found decrepit and soiled. Murphy lost his Legislative Council position at the election."

  "text" : "James Graham, 6th Duke of Montrose KT CB CVO VD (1 May 1878 – 20 January 1954), was a Scottish nobleman, naval officer, politician and engineer. The eldest son of Douglas Graham, 5th Duke of Montrose, he was educated at Eton College. In 1906 he married Lady Mary Douglas-Hamilton, the only child of the 12th Duke of Hamilton. They had four children, Lord James Graham (later the 7th Duke), Lady Mary Graham, Lord Ronald Graham and Lady Jean Graham. As a mariner, he served in the Mercantile Marine and ASC in South Africa, during which time he obtained the first film ever taken of a total eclipse of the Sun during a Royal Astronomical Society expedition to India in 1899, and took part in a mission in 1900 for Lloyd's of London to the South African Government to establish wireless telegraphic stations on the coast. Having been instrumental in founding the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) in 1903, he served in the Auxiliary Naval Service during World War I and was later Commodore of the RNVR Clyde Division, then the East Coast of Scotland RNVR, and fulfilled the role of Commodore of the entire RNVR from 1921 until he retired in 1927. As a result, from 1946 to 1968, whichever ship was attached to the Tay Division of the Royal Naval Reserve (in Dundee) was always temporarily renamed HMS Montrose after the 6th Duke. In 1992, the seventh Duke-class frigate HMS Montrose was so-named for the same reason. In his political life, he was unpaid Assistant Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1905, and Naval Aide-de-Camp to His Majesty. However, he was unsuccessful as the Scottish Unionist Party (effectively the Conservative Party in Scotland) parliamentary candidate for Stirlingshire in 1906, and as the Conservative Party candidate at the 1906 by-election at Eye, Suffolk, and at the subsequent general election in 1910; although holding the courtesy title of the Marquess of Graham from 1907 (when his father was the 5th Duke), he contested these elections as James Graham. He entered the House of Lords as the 6th Duke when he succeeded to the title in 1925. When the Home Rule movement decided to split from the avowedly anti-Home Rule Scottish Unionist Party in 1932, he became chairman of the new centre-right Scottish Party, and successfully steered it towards a merger with the centre-left National Party of Scotland in April 1934, therefore founding the modern Scottish National Party. He joined the Liberal Party in 1936. As an engineer, he was the inventor of the world's first naval aircraft carrier, when in 1912, as a director of William Beardmore and Company, of Dalmuir, he designed a 14,450 ton merchant vessel intended for delivery to the Lloyd Sabaudo Line of Italy as the SS Conte Rosso. When war broke out in 1914, work on the vessel ceased, but was resumed in 1916 as an aircraft carrier. The conversion work was completed in September 1918 and the vessel was commissioned as HMS Argus - recognised as the first ever \"flat top\". The Duke was also designer and owner of the first seagoing heavy oil motorship. He was President of the British Institution of Marine Engineers in 1911, and President of the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1916 and 1917. Afterwards, he was Vice-President of the Institution of Naval Architects, a Younger Brother of Trinity House, a Trustee for the Honourable Company of Master Mariners, a Member of the Royal Company of Archers, and Commodore of the Sea Cadets in Scotland. In 1935 he became the second President on the National Institute for the Deaf, a post he held until his death."

  "text" : "John Samuel Potts (12 August 1861 – 28 April 1938) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom who served a Member of Parliament (MP) for twelve years between 1922 and 1938. Born in Bolton, Lancashire, Potts had started work at Durham Colliery at the age of eleven. He was a checkweighman at the Hemsworth Colliery, Yorkshire, for 25 years. At the Barnsley by-election of 1897 Potts supported the Liberal Party-candidate Joseph Walton. While chairing a Liberal election meeting during this by-election, Potts said in the presence of Walton that he would favour a labour party at a time when state payment of MPs, and of official election expenses would enable working men to be maintained in Parliament. But until then, \"the Liberal party was the working man’s only hope\". In 1905, Potts switched sides, and started working with the Independent Labour Party against Walton, and the leadership of the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA). Ten years later Potts was elected as treasurer of the YMA, and became a member of the executive committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. He kept these positions until he was elected as MP for Barnsley at the 1922 general election, when payment of MPs and election expenses had been enacted. Potts held the seat at three further elections in the 1920s. When Labour split at the 1931 general election over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of a National Government, he narrowly lost his seat to the National Liberal candidate Richard John Soper. Potts was comfortably re-elected at the 1935 general election, but died in office in 1938, in Barnsley, aged 76. His illness and death have been connected with the shock he received when the Wharncliffe Woodmoor Pit Disaster occurred two years earlier. His home was in the lane which led to the colliery."

James Clement Baxter was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England, on 1 July 1857. His father, William Baxter, was originally from Clitheroe and his mother, Ann Hughes, was from Liverpool. His father was Church of England and his mother was Roman Catholic. His father was a chemist and druggist in Great Homer Street Everton, Liverpool. His mother's father, James Hughes, was from Ireland. Baxter was a Licentiate of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, renamed Royal College of Physicians of Ireland from 1890 when, under charter of Queen Victoria, it adopted the present title. According to college records he was admitted on 13 December 1878. He had received his medical training at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary and, presumably, made the short journey to Dublin just to sit the examination (as many English doctors did). After qualifying as a doctor he set up a practice in Robson Street Liverpool. Baxter was initially a medical adviser for Everton F.C. and later he reluctantly became the club's chairman. In 1892 he advanced the club a loan of £1000 to develop Goodison Park."

  "text" : "Edson Jonasi Zvobgo (2 October 1935 – 22 August 2004) was a founder of Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF, was the Patriotic Front's spokesman at the Lancaster House in late 1979, a Harvard-trained lawyer, and a poet. His name is often misspelled by the media, either as Eddison instead of Edson or Zvogbo instead of Zvobgo. He was born in then Southern Rhodesia in 1935, near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo), where his father was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1960, Zvobgo won a scholarship to Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts aged 25. After taking a bachelor's degree there in 1964, he returned home to be arrested and detained for political activism against white rule in Rhodesia, along with Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo. Zvobgo was freed in 1971, and he spent a period in exile in Canada. He then studied law at Harvard and international relations at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, followed by a position as associate professor teaching criminal law at Lewis University College in Illinois. Zvobgo played a key role in international negotiations at Lancaster House that ended the bitter bush war and led to British-sponsored all race elections ahead of independence in 1980. He was the Zanu-PF spokesman, and impressed many in the international press with his quick repartee and astute analysis of the negotiations. In the 1980 elections, he won a seat in parliament for Masvingo, which he continued to hold until his death. An influential member of Zimbabwe's first fully independent cabinet, Zvobgo was minister for local government and housing until 1982, and minister for justice until 1985. As minister of parliamentary and constitutional affairs, in 1987 he made several amendments to the Constitution that concentrated power in the hands of the president and moved Zimbabwe towards a one-party state. Initially a staunch supporter of Zanu-PF policies, in later years he criticised Robert Mugabe's autocratic rule. In 1992 Zvobgo was moved to the less influential post of Minister of Mines. In 1996 he survived a car accident, in which both his legs were broken. This accident was considered suspicious by many. Shortly after the accident Mugabe demoted Zvobgo further to Minister Without Portfolio, and, in 2000, he was dropped from the cabinet altogether. In the 2002 presidential elections, he refused to campaign for Mugabe, but did not endorse the opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). He also voiced his opposition to the sweeping media law, passed the same year, calling it \"the most serious assault on our constitutional liberties since independence\". Despite his criticism, Zvobgo eventually voted for the legislation, which was used to close off Zimbabwe's only privately owned daily newspaper, The Daily News, and to arrest at least 31 independent journalists. He became the subject of an internal party disciplinary inquiry in 2003 for his refusal to campaign for Mugabe and after describing the laws as a weapon to stifle opposition to the government, but allegations of disloyalty were eventually dropped. Zvobgo had also been accused of holding private talks with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change as the ruling party abandoned formal dialogue between the two parties. Zvobgo died on 22 August 2004 after a lengthy battle with cancer. His wife Julia Tukai Zvobgo, a former Zanu-PF MP, died in February 2004 at the age of 67. He is survived by his seven children, Kerina, Edson Junior, Tsungirirai, Jonasi, Esther, Tendai and Farai Emily."

  "text" : "Wilmer Cleveland Wells (4 November, 1839 – October 19, 1933) was a rancher, lumberman and political figure in British Columbia. He represented East Kootenay North from 1899 to 1903 and Columbia from 1903 to 1907 as a Liberal in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. Wells was first elected to the assembly in an 1899 by-election held following the death of William George Nielson. He was named to the provincial cabinet in 1902 as Commissioner of Lands and Works but was dropped from cabinet soon afterwards because it was alleged by the opposition that he was an agent of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Wells was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1907. In 1907, he bought the Hume Hotel in Nelson from John Frederick Hume. Wells died in Vancouver at the age of 93. The settlement of Wilmer was named after him."

Born in Balmain to seaman James Molesworth and Elizabeth Ellen Vibert, his family travelled to the socialist New Australia settlement in Paraguay when he was an infant.

A member of the Labor Party, he was secretary of the Homebush branch, the Granville state electorate council and the Nepean federal electorate council. In 1915 he was elected to the district committee of the Australian Journalists Association, of which he was treasurer (1917–19) and president (1919–21). Molesworth was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1920 as a Labor member for Cumberland, serving until 1925, when he became chief of staff of the Times, later becoming editor from 1927 to 1929. In 1925 he left the Labor Party and later joined the Nationalist Party.

  "text" : "Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon PC SL KC (5 October 1732 – 4 April 1802) was a British politician and barrister, who served as Attorney General, Master of the Rolls and Lord Chief Justice. Born to a country gentleman, he was initially educated in Hanmer before moving to Ruthin School aged 12. Rather than going to university he instead worked as a clerk to an attorney, joining the Middle Temple in 1750 and being called to the Bar in 1756. Initially almost unemployed due to the lack of education and contacts which a university education would have provided, his business increased thanks to his friendships with John Dunning, who, overwhelmed with cases, allowed Kenyon to work many, and Lord Thurlow who secured for him the Chief Justiceship of Chester in 1780. He was returned as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hindon the same year, serving repeatedly as Attorney General under William Pitt the Younger. He effectively sacrificed his political career in 1784 to challenge the ballot of Charles James Fox, and was rewarded with a baronetcy; from then on he did not speak in the House of Commons, despite remaining an MP. On 27 March 1784 he was appointed Master of the Rolls, a job to which he dedicated himself once he ceased to act as an MP. He had previously practised in the Court of Chancery, and although unfamiliar with Roman law was highly efficient; Lord Eldon said \"I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than any of my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beat us all\". On 9 June 1788, Kenyon succeeded Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice, and was granted a barony. Although not rated as highly as his predecessor, his work \"restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law\". He remained Lord Chief Justice until his death in 1802."

He was the Labor member for Murrumbidgee in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1970 to 1984. He was Minister for Conservation and Water Resources from 1976 to 1981 (with Conservation replaced by Lands and Forests in 1980), Minister for Local Government and Lands from 1981 to 1984, and Minister for Lands and Ports for a few months in 1984. Gordon was born in Cessnock to baker David Irvine Gordon and Mary Mildred Cleary. He was educated at government schools in Cessnock and after graduating was apprenticed to a pharmacy. He attended the University of Sydney, graduating in 1945. On 6 November 1943 he married Valerie Merle Webber, with whom he had five children. He subsequently owned a pharmacy, and also a trotting stud near Leeton. A Roman Catholic, he joined the Australian Labor Party in 1962. In 1965, he was elected to Leeton Shire Council, where he served until 1970 (including a year as President, 1969–1970). When Al Grassby, Labor member for Murrumbidgee, resigned in 1969 to contest the federal seat of Riverina, Gordon was selected as the Labor candidate for the resulting by-election, which took place early in 1970. He easily defeated his Liberal and Country Party opponents. In 1976, he was appointed to the ministry, holding the Conservation and Water Resources portfolios. He briefly served as Acting Minister for Health in 1977, for Local Government in 1978 and for Corrective Services in 1979. In 1980 the Conservation portfolio was split into Lands and Forests, both of which were retained by Gordon. In 1981 his Forests and Water Resources portfolios were exchanged for Local Government, which in turn was exchanged for Ports in 1984. Gordon retired in 1984; his seat was won by National Party candidate Adrian Cruickshank in his absence. Gordon died at his Wagga Wagga home on 16 June 2011."

She actively supported women's suffrage and helped set up what would become the Women's Labour League branch in Battersea. She became involved in the British Committee of the International Congress for Peace and Freedom in 1914. Ganley was a school manager and governor, becoming a Justice of the Peace (JP) in 1920, one of London's first female magistrates. She joined the Labour and Co-operative Parties and served on Battersea Council (1919–25, 1953–65) and the London County Council (1925–29 and 1934–37), and was a member of the London County Education Committee. She contested the Paddington North seat at the 1935 general election. At the 1945 general election, Ganley was elected as Member of Parliament for Battersea South. She narrowly held the seat in 1950 but was defeated by Ernest Partridge in 1951. Ganley was elected a director of the West London Co-operative Society in 1918 and served on the board of its successor, the London Co-operative Society for many years and as President 1942-46, its first woman president. She held national positions in the Women's Co-operative Guild and was one of the speakers at its diamond jubilee celebrations at the Royal Albert Hall in 1943. She was awarded the CBE in 1953."

  "text" : "Chris Korwin-Kuczynski (born 1953) is a former Canadian municipal politician. He served as a councillor in Toronto from 1981 to 2003, and was the city's deputy mayor for a time. He was born in Toronto, and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from York University. He has been a director of the Polish-Canadian Congress, and has served as a special assistant to the federal Minister of State for Multiculturalism. He ran unsuccessfully for city council in 1980 as Chris Korwin but was successful on his second attempt, in a 1981 by-election. In 1992, Korwin-Kuczynski successfully urged that the music group Barenaked Ladies be banned from performing a concert in Nathan Phillips Square because he believed their name objectified women (Toronto Star, 20 July 2005). This decision was widely ridiculed, and gave considerable publicity to the then-obscure band. Korwin-Kuczynski was a member of the council's right-wing, and was a frequent ally of fellow councillor Tom Jakobek (Toronto Star, 29 November 1994). Kyle Rae has suggested that Korwin-Kuczynski became isolated on council when Jakobek left in 2000 (Globe and Mail, 16 September 2003). In 1993, Korwin-Kuczynski was removed as chair of the Toronto Board of Health after criticizing a strongly worded AIDS prevention pamphlet published by the AIDS Committee of Toronto (Toronto Star, 23 January 1993). He had suggested that the Committee, which received significant support from Toronto's gay community, be denied city funding if it continued publishing such materials (Globe and Mail, 25 January 1995). Referring to his dismissal after the vote, he commented, \"[t]he only real issue I think this all stems from is AIDS, the whole issue surrounding the gay issue\" (Toronto Star, 22 January 1993). Kyle Rae, who is openly gay, has said that Korwin-Kuczynski was anti-gay during the early 1990s but later changed his views. In 2003, Rae was quoted as saying, \"He's now generally supportive of these issues, but that didn't come easily.\" He opposed a 1996 municipal bill that banned smoking in restaurants and bars, and requested that provincial Premier Mike Harris veto the measure (Montreal Gazette, 8 July 1996). Korwin-Kuczynski considered running for the Liberal nomination in Parkdale—High Park in the 1997 federal election, but ultimately declined (Toronto Star, 16 February 1997). He retired from the council in 2003, amid rumours that he would move into consulting work (Toronto Star, 24 December 2003). He endorsed Dennis Mills's bid for re-election in the 2004 federal election, and a newspaper report from the period suggest that he was considering running as a Liberal candidate in the next federal election (Globe and Mail, 22 December 2003). On September 27, 2006, he filed papers to run in the Toronto municipal election, 2006 in Ward 14. However the next day he withdrew his nomination. This allowed him to retain a fundraising surplus of $21,742 leftover from his last campaign. If he hadn't done this the money would have flowed into the city coffers. Korwin-Kuczynski is a former honorary Captain of the Canadian Navy, and once served as a Director on the board of the Royal Canadian Military Institute in Toronto. His nickname is K-K."

A former Australian politician, he served for one term as the Labor member for Chatsworth in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 2006 to 2009. Bombolas was born in Newcastle, New South Wales. Whilst working for the Qld Police Dept he graduated from the Queensland University of Technology with a Bachelor of Business degree in Communications. He became a radio host and worked for 4BC, 4BK and Triple M, before joining the Channel Nine as a sports presenter. In July 2006, Bombolas believed he could \"make a difference in my community\", and announced his intention to run for the Australian Labor Party in the seat of Chatsworth in the 2006 election. Bombolas won the seat against the incumbent member Michael Caltabiano of the Liberal Party. On 9 July 2007, Bombolas became Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister for Sport and Local Government, Andrew Fraser. Bombolas announced on 19 February 2009 that he would not contest the 2009 state election. In June 2009, Bombolas became the Chairman of the A-league football club Brisbane Roar. His controversial decision to replace coach Frank Farina with Ange Postecoglou saw the Brisbane Roar win the record for the longest unbeaten run at the top level of any Australian football code, which stands at 36 league matches without defeat.[3] Brisbane Roar are also the first and only club to win back to back A-League Championships.[4] In 2012, Bombolas was asked to join Hancock Coal/GVK as their External Affairs Advisor (Media & Corporate Communications Advisor). He now works as a freelance Media and Communications Specialist, plus is a qualified Auctioneer."

He was an uncle of politician Knud Christian Knudsen. He finished his secondary education in 1861, graduated with the cand.theol. degree in 1867, and in 1879 he became vicar in the newly established parish of Nedre Eiker. When Nedre Eiker became its own municipality in 1885, he sat in the municipal council and on the school board and was elected mayor. He left Nedre Eiker in 1886, and became a curate in Drammen. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from that city in 1894 and 1897. He was then elected for a third term in 1900 from the constituency Tønsberg, where he had been appointed vicar. On 11 March 1905, when Michelsen's Cabinet assumed office, Knudsen was appointed Norwegian Minister of Education and Church Affairs.

Thereafter, Molloy sat out the remainder of her term as an independent before being defeated at the 2006 state election.

During his school days, Stephen was active in the Balajanasakhyam (promoted by Malayala Manorama). This helped him to develop leadership qualities, oratorial and organizing skills. After completing B L, Stephen, started his career as a journalist. He also started 'Pouraprabha' an evening daily. Through this daily he supported the Travancore Congress and attacked the rule of C.P.Ramaswamy Iyyer. In 1949, he gave up his career as a journalist and started practising law. In 1951, he joined active politics and in the same year became the D C C president of Kollam. He was a close associate of veteran Congress leaders P.T.Chacko, Pattom Thanu Pillai and R. Sankar and provided leadership in the Vimochana Samaram during 1958-59 period as an associate of P.T.Chacko, Pattom Thanu Pillai, R.Sankar and others. He was also one of the founding fathers of I N T U C, the trade union wing of the Indian National Congress. He won the State elections in 1960, 1965 and 1971. He was also elected as an MP from Idukki in the 1976 parliamentary elections. He was a close aide of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He was the leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party - Indira faction during 1978-79. C. M. Stephen also served in the Union Cabinet under Indira Gandhi, most notably as the Union Minister for Communications. Shashi Tharoor in his 'India: From Midnight to the Millennium' quotes Stephen's statement in Parliament that \"the telephone was a luxury and not a necessity\" as symptomatic of India's failure to invest in infrastructure and communications before the Reforms of 1991. Dharam Singh gave up the Gulbarga Lok Sabha seat to accommodate C. M. Stephen, the then Union Home Minister in the Indira Gandhi Cabinet, after he lost the election in Delhi to Atal Bihari Vajpayee. C. M. Stephen was buried at the St. Mary's Orthodox Cathedral, Mavelikkara."

He served as a minister under Labor Premier Robert Cosgrove until his sudden floor-crossing defection in 1956. Bramich was promoted to Cabinet in November 1946 and was appointed Assistant Minister for Education and Transport, but was defeated in a caucus election for a reshuffle several months later. He returned to Cabinet in May 1948 following the defeat of Rowland Worsley, and was assigned Worsley's former role of Minister for Forests. He again lost his position in a caucus election, and again regained it after another vacancy in April 1949, being appointed Minister for Housing. Bramich suddenly resigned as Minister for Housing and from the Labor Party on 11 September 1956, costing the Labor government its majority in parliament. He claimed that his recommendations were being ignored and his decisions set aside. He was also facing party censure for having, while Acting Minister for Health, made a public statement claiming that his colleagues had \"deliberately frustrated\" his efforts to reconstitute a country hospitals board. Bramich initially claimed that he would sit on the crossbenches, but defected to the Liberal Party later that day. An attempt to install a Liberal government mid-term was only thwarted when Premier Robert Cosgrove called an early election, following a constitutional crisis around whether the Governor would allow him to dissolve parliament. Bramich had been expected to lose his seat at the subsequent election, but instead topped the Liberal poll in his seat. Bramich retired from politics in 1964 and died later that year."

As of 2005, she is the chief of the DAP Malacca women's wing, and also represents the constituency of Kota Laksamana in the State Assembly of Malacca. She is also married to the current Chief Minister of the State of Penang who also the Secretary-General of the DAP, YAB Tuan Lim Guan Eng, and is the daughter-in-law of the former Opposition Leader in the Parliament of Malaysia, Lim Kit Siang, who is also of the DAP. In 2005, she suffered a surprise defeat when running for re-election to the DAP Malacca committee, placing second-last, finishing ahead of only her husband. However, while her husband automatically qualified to sit on the committee by virtue of his position as party Secretary-General, Chew did not. Chew was \"saddened by the results\", but said she accepted her defeat. However, Teresa Kok, a DAP Member of Parliament, suggested there was a conspiracy behind the defeat of Lim and Chew in their re-election campaigns. In 2006, it was reported that Chew would become the first Malacca assemblyman to give birth while in office. At the time, Chew had three children with Lim: Rachael, aged 15, Clint, aged 14, and Marcus, aged 11. In 2008, Chew defeated newcomer Lee Kiat Lee for the Kota Laksamana seat where she had 11043 votes while Lee had only 3801 votes."

In the 1980s he worked within the Liberian Ministry of National Defense. In 1986-87 he was working within the G-4 Branch of the AFL. In 1991, according to biographical details issued at a 2007 U.S. Institute of Peace briefing, he was appointed as Deputy Minister of Defence for Operations. The biographical details said that he 'was responsible for reestablishing civilian control over the Liberian army and established an urban response team to counter urban terrorism.' He served in this position until 1994. In 1993-94, he served as commander of the 'Black Berets,' a paramilitary police force in the Monrovia enclave of Amos Sawyer's Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU). The International Crisis Group also notes that the Black Berets also fought alongside ECOMOG at times, notably during Charles Taylor's 1992 assault on Monrovia ('Operation Octopus'). 'They and the AFL were accused of killing some 600 civilians in the June 1993 Camp Carter massacre, which, testimony at the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission has indicated, was perpetuated by Taylor's NPFL fighters, who may have orchestrated it to put blame on the Armed Forces of Liberia.' He served as Director of the Liberian National Police from 1994–95 and Deputy Minister of State for Administration from 1995 to 1997. In 1998 he served on the AFL Restructuring Commission, where he was listed as a retired Colonel of the AFL in private business. From 1999 to c.2004/05 he served as a security officer with the United Nations, initially with UNTAET in East Timor, and then from 2000 with UNHCR and the UN Department of Safety and Security in Tanzania.

Prest however was not publicly disciplined and retained his position as whip but the controversy did see him being taken about out of the limelight of public life.

  "text" : "U Lwin (Burmese: ဦးလွင်; 22 October 1924 – 6 December 2011) was a career army officer (ranked Colonel) in the Burmese Army and a National League for Democracy politician, who won a parliamentary seat in the Burmese general election, 1990, after contesting the Thongwa constituency. U Lwin was born in Rangoon's Pazundaung Township to parents Ba Tha and Thein. He first joined the Burma Independence Army in 1942 and served during World War II and in anti-rebel and anti-Kuomintang campaigns in the 1940s to 1950s, after Burma declared its independence. After martial law was declared in 1962, he served various roles including Minister of Finance, deputy prime minister and member of the Revolutionary Council under the Burma Socialist Programme Party, until his resignation in 1980. U Lwin is Secretary of the NLD and is a former party Treasurer. He was among the NLD representatives who boycotted the National Convention in December 1995 and is a former BSPP Deputy Prime Minister and member of the BSPP State Council.He completed high school in Rangoon before World War II and served in the Burma Independence Army (BIA), Burma Defence Army (BDA) and with the Patriotic Burmese Force (PBF) from 1942-1945. He completed BDA officer training at the Japanese Royal Military Academy and from 1952-1954 studied at the British Royal Military Academy. He was also the Military Attaché to the USA. U Lwin was put under de facto house arrest on 22 September 2000 and released on 1 December 2000.[ Member of CRPP, Chairperson of Committee for Health and Social Affairs ] U Lwin received 18,189 valid votes or 68 % in the 1990 elections.{ The only original member of the executive committee, who was left after 1990 to help U Aung Shwe in his struggle to keep the NLD intact through the years that threatened its viability as a political party, was U Lwin, the treasurer. U Lwin had joined the Burmese Independence Army as an 18-year-old boy at the outbreak of the war. In August 1943 he was among a batch of Burmese cadets chosen to go to Japan for training at the Rikugun Shikan Gakko (army academy). By the time the young Burmese officers had completed their training in April 1945, the anti-fascist resistance movement had started and U Lwin and his fellow graduates of the military academy remained in Hakone until October 1945, making charcoal which they sold to buy food. U Lwin continued with his career in the army after independence and was sent on training courses to England and West Germany. In 1959 he was sent to Washington as military attache. On his return from the United States he spent some years as deputy commander of Central Command, then commander of South Eastern Command before he was asked to come back to Rangoon to become a deputy minister. As the military government that assumed power in 1962 took on a civilian garb under the Burmese Socialist Programme Party, U Lwin served successively as minister of finance, deputy prime minister and a member of the state council. It was as a member of the state council that he resigned in 1980. U Lwin joined the NLD in 1988 and was appointed treasurer because of his experience in finances and his unquestioned integrity. In 1992, when the NLD was forced to reorganize its executive committee, U Lwin took on the post of secretary, while U Aung Shwe became chairman. He died of natural causes at his home in Yangon's Bahan Township on 7 December 2011. He was subsequently cremated at the Yayway Cemetery."

Later she studied for her diploma of Community Development at the Chisholm Institute in Melbourne, and attained a Bachelor of Arts (Community Development) at Victoria University. Before entering politics, Lobato worked as a bookkeeper, office administrator, and in the retail trade.She has two children, and lives in the Melbourne suburb of Berwick. Lobato was elected as Member for Gembrook in November 2002. She was re-elected in 2006, winning by just 499 votes, but lost her seat in 2010. Lobato voted against abortion law reform in 2008. She was not targeted by Right to Life organisations, and her support for pro-life positions in parliament was unlikely to have been a factor in her defeat. She has been a vocal campaigner against the introduction of genetically modified crops. She questioned whether the Victorian Chief Scientist, Sir Gustav Nossal, was independent enough to advise the Government of Victoria on the subject, and has been critical of Victorian Premier John Brumby for approving genetically modified canola plantations in Victoria.Said Lobato: \"I feel that Victoria will be put into a very risky situation. I believe that our agricultural industry will be put at risk. I know for a fact that people do not want to eat genetically modified foods.\""

He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1933 to 1938, representing the Lang Labor Party (1933), South Australian Lang Labor Party (1933–1934) and Australian Labor Party (1934–1938). Howard was born in Gilbert Street, Adelaide, and educated at Christian Brothers College. He became a delegate for the Labor Party in 1908, and was elected president of the Painters' Union in 1909. He became the union's assistant state secretary in 1913, and succeeded T. B. Merry as state secretary that December. He subsequently served as the union's delegate to both the United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia and the United Labor Party, served on the union's federal council, was a member of the Painters and Decorators' Wages Board, and represented the Trades and Labor Council in various capacities. In 1918, he was elected president of the Trades and Labor Council, and in 1920 shifted to the role of its secretary. He was an unsuccessful Labor candidate for the House of Assembly at the 1918 election, 1921 election and 1924 election, in the Liberal-leaning seats of Sturt and Barossa. In 1933, in the wake of the Great Depression and the 1931 Labor split, Howard was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly for Adelaide, representing the Lang Labor Party, a faction of the Australian Labor Party supporting the ideas of Jack Lang, the Premier of New South Wales. In April, however, he and fellow Lang Labor MP Bob Dale left the party after disputes with leader Doug Bardolph, forming their own breakaway group, the South Australian Lang Labor Party. In June 1934 the various Labor factions were reunited. Howard was defeated at the next election in 1938. In 1945, he retired from the union movement and his then role as state secretary of the Shop Employees and Warehouse Employees' Union, citing failing hearing. He died at his home in Sturt Street, Adelaide in 1949, aged 69, and was buried in the Catholic Cemetery at West Terrace."

  "text" : "Robert Law McCartney, QC (born 24 April 1936) is a Northern Irish barrister and a former leader of the UK Unionist Party. He was initially a member of the Ulster Unionist Party but was expelled in June 1987 when he refused to withdraw from the general election of that year. He stood against the incumbent Popular Unionist Party MP Sir James Kilfedder in North Down as a \"Real Unionist\" but failed to win the seat. In the 1995 by-election in North Down after the death of Kilfedder he was elected as a \"UK Unionist\" defeating the Ulster Unionist Party candidate. He subsequently established the United Kingdom Unionist Party to contest elections to the Northern Ireland Forum and the related talks which startedin 1996. The other party representatives to the Forum were Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien and Cedric Wilson, a former low-level DUP member in the 1980s. McCartney retained his Westminster seat in the 1997 election. He opposed the subsequent Belfast Agreement in the May 1998 referendum and his party won five seats in the Assembly elections later that year (McCartney himself in North Down, Cedric Wilson in Strangford, Patrick Roche in Lagan Valley, Norman Boyd in South Antrim and Roger Hutchinson East Antrim). However, Wilson, Roche, Boyd and Hutchinson parted company with McCartney in December 1998 because of their leader's so-called 'exit strategy' from the Northern Ireland Assembly in the event of Sinn Féin being allowed seats in the new Northern Ireland Government. McCartney denounced them, saying all four 'were famous in their own living rooms' and that their supporters 'could fit into a telephone box.' In 2008 both Wilson and Boyd attended meetings of Jim Allister's Traditional Unionist Voice. In 1999, Robert McCartney ran for the party in elections to the European Parliament, winning 2.9% of the first preference vote. He lost his Westminster seat in the 2001 election to the UUP candidate Lady Hermon. He was committed to a policy of integration for Northern Ireland, whereby legislative devolution for Northern Ireland would no longer be Westminster's abiding policy, there would be no Stormont legislative assembly and the province would be a fully participating part of the United Kingdom; at the same time the three main British political parties would fully organise in Northern Ireland. He was the president of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1986, and led it in its four years of prominence after the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. McCartney resigned as head of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1988 over a dispute with its executive. These integrationist policies, once popular in some sections of Unionism, receded with the introduction of devolution to Scotland and Wales, and the creation of a functioning Northern Ireland Assembly. However it is the case that other parts of the United Kingdom with devolved assemblies are fully covered by the three main British political parties, but not in Northern Ireland. McCartney also strongly opposed the St Andrews Agreement and in 2007 stood on an anti-agreement ticket in six different constituencies. He lost his own seat in North Down, polling 1,806 first preference votes (5.9% of the total, and less than half the quota required to be elected). He also obtained 360 votes (1.2%) in Belfast North, 388 votes (0.8%) in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, 853 votes (2.0%) in Lagan Valley, 893 votes (2.3%) in South Antrim and 220 votes (0.5%) in West Tyrone He claims to have retired from politics following the loss of his seat in the 2007 Assembly Election to Brian Wilson of the Green Party. However, he still occasionally makes media appearances and writes newspaper articles and in October 2009, Robert McCartney was guest speaker at the Traditional Unionist Voice party conference in Belfast, where he spoke on the situation surrounding the primary school transfer test, brought about by a Sinn Féin Education Minister."

Beggs, it was the same as \"the speeches of Osama Bin Laden being played on a trans-Atlantic Arabian airline.\" Aer Lingus removed the material from their flights stating: \"It is something that should not have been on board and we removed it immediately we became aware of it.\""

He served as general secretary of the Students Union at Giridih College. From 1971 onwards he served as chairman of the Giridih municipality. He owned hundreds of liquor shops across several states, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa. In Giridih, Prasad was seen as a Robin Hood-like figure, known for his philanthropic actions towards the local community. His image was tarnished by a scandal in 1979, after 233 people in Dhanbad District died from liquor poisoning. However, his reputation in Giridih remained solid and he was nominated as the Congress (I) candidate for the Giridih seat in the 1980 Bihar Legislative Assembly election. This was the first time he contested an election to the Legislative Assembly. Randhir Prasad died in a jeep accident on May 16, 1980, just two weeks ahead of the election, at the age of 35. The election in Giridih was countermanded and held in 1981. His widow, Urmila Devi, stood as candidate for the seat. Devi, with no previous political experience, managed to defeat the incumbent veteran Communist Party of India politician Chaturanan Mishra with 55.71% of the votes in the constituency."

  "text" : "Raef al-Maarri was an officer in the Syrian Army and a deputy of Colonel Jassem Alwan. Politically aligned with the Nasserists, supporters of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, Maarri and Alwan orchestrated a failed coup attempt against the Ba'athist-dominated government that took power in the coup d'état of 8 March 1963, which toppled the secessionist government of Nazim al-Qudsi and Khalid al-Azm. The latter two themselves gained power after a coup that ended the union with Egypt in the United Arab Republic. The Nasserists were major participants in the 8 March coup, but were increasingly sidelined by the Ba'athists who executed a mass purging of Nasserists and political independents beginning in late April. Maarri and Alwan planned a counter coup against the Ba'athists with the aid of the Arab Nationalist Movement in Syria and Egyptian intelligence. The insurrection was launched on 18 July, but was violently quelled by the security forces led Amin al-Hafiz, the Ba'athist Interior Minister. Several Nasserist officers were arrested and executed in the immediate aftermath, but Maarri managed to flee the authorities and went into hiding in the Ghouta countryside of Damascus with Alwan. After being discovered and apprehended, both were tried by a military court where Maarri plead guilty to his role in the abortive coup, stating it was an attempt to ensure the unification process with Egypt and Iraq would continue in light of the Ba'athists' perceived anti-unionist actions. Maarri was sentenced to death, but the sentence was later reduced to life imprisonment on 10 December. He was released a year later in December 1964 with Alwan and several other alleged participants in the July coup in an amnesty agreement. Afterward, the men were escorted to the border with Lebanon from which they departed for the Egyptian embassy in Beirut to seek asylum in Egypt, which Egypt granted."

  "text" : "David Nicholas Winderlich (born 18 January 1964), is an Australian teacher, public servant and politician who in February 2009 was the Australian Democrats nominee to fill a South Australian Legislative Council casual vacancy in a joint sitting of the Parliament of South Australia following the January 2009 parliamentary resignation of the incumbent Democrats member Sandra Kanck. Becoming an independent after nine months, he was the last Democrat to have sat in any Australian parliament. He was not re-elected at the 2010 election. On 20 July 2009 Winderlich announced that, unless 1,000 new members joined the Democrats SA division by 23 November, he would leave the party and sit as an independent, which eventuated on 7 October 2009. Winderlich announced that, as an independent, he would focus on three policy areas: governmental reform, rights and freedoms, e.g., for bikies, and a sustainable approach to the management of water resources in South Australia. In particular, he was opposed to the Port Stanvac Desalination Plant and to the Wellington Weir proposal."

Thomas studied journalism at the University of Toronto, and worked as an arts reporter at the Toronto Star before marrying film director Ralph Thomas. As a resident of The Beaches, she became an activist in the campaign against the Scarborough Expressway, and ran for municipal office in the 1972 election, defeating incumbent councillor Tom Wardle. She was one of several progressive reform candidates, including Elizabeth Eayrs, Michael Goldrick, Colin Vaughan, Dan Heap, Karl Jaffary, Reid Scott, John Sewell and Anne Johnston, who were elected alongside mayor David Crombie. Thomas was re-elected in the 1974 election, but was defeated in the 1976 election by Tom Wardle, Jr., the son of the councillor she had defeated in 1972. She ran again in the 1980 election, defeating Wardle, and served until the 1985 election, when she was defeated by Paul Christie. Thomas and council colleague Dale Martin made national headlines in 1985 when, while attending a Federation of Canadian Municipalities conference in Calgary, they got into a war of words with Calgary mayor Ralph Klein about how ugly and poorly planned they perceived the city to be; Thomas was also quoted as calling Calgary City Hall an \"abomination\". Both Thomas and Martin later apologized for the comments. Following her electoral defeat, Thomas was appointed head of Metro Toronto's licensing commission, and continued to serve on the Toronto Licensing Commission until 2003. In 1996, she coauthored a report investigating problems with the city's process for licensing taxis. She also remained an active member of the New Democratic Party. Thomas died of cancer on May 9, 2005."

Labor was defeated at the 1993 state election and Taylor became Leader of the Opposition in February 1994 when Lawrence resigned to enter federal parliament. He was succeeded by Jim McGinty in October. In 1996 he resigned to contest the federal seat of Kalgoorlie against Labor rebel Graeme Campbell, who defeated him as an independent. He was the first WA Labor leader in decades not to take the party into an election. In 2000 Taylor announced his intention to leave the ALP over the treatment of former Labor politician Larry Graham."

He then changed his civil job to that of surveyor of customs and excise. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1836, 1839, 1842, 1845, 1848, 1851 and 1854, representing the constituency of Arendal og Grimstad. In October 1854 he was appointed Minister of Church and Education, succeeding Jørgen Herman Vogt. In September 1855 he left that succeeded Vogt again, this time as Minister of Finance and Customs. He held this position periodically until June 1863, interrupted by spells as member of the Council of State Division in Stockholm from 1 June 1856 to 31 July 1857, 1 September 1858 to 30 September 1859 and 1 September 1861 to 31 August 1862. Otto Vincent Lange was married to Anne Nicoline Aall (1800–1886), daughter of businessperson, politician and historian Jacob Aall. The Aall family was a notable one; Anne Nicoline Aall's grandfather was businessman Nicolai Benjamin Aall (died 1798) and her uncles were politicians Niels and Jørgen Aall. Also, Otto Vincent Lange had a brother Ulrik Frederik Lange who was an educator and five-term member of Parliament. Otto Vincent's sister Barbara Abigael married Even Hanssen, whose son Johan Jørgen Lange Hanssen married Otto Vincent's daughter Lovise Jacobine. Otto Vincent Lange was proclaimed Knight of the Order of St. Olav 1847, promoted to Commander in 1857, and in 1863 was awarded the Grand Cross in 1863. He was awarded two Swedish orders: the Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star and Knight of the Order of Vasa. Lange also held the first class (equivalent to Grand Cross) of the Ottoman Mecidi Order. He died in 1870 in Kristiania and was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund."

  "text" : "Olav Meisdalshagen (17 March 1903 – 21 November 1959) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party best known for serving as the Norwegian Minister of Finance from December 1947 to November 1951 and as the Norwegian Minister of Agriculture from January 1955 to May 1956. He was also a Member of Parliament for a long time, being elected for the first time in parliamentary election of 1936 and serving until his death, except for the period between 1940 and 1945 when the Parliament of Norway was de facto defunct due to the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. His death in 1959 came halfway through his fifth term in Parliament, and shortly after a parliamentary speech. A jurist by profession, Meisdalshagen came from a humble family background, growing up at a former crofter's farm in rural Nord-Aurdal, and losing his father in the 1920s. After studying he moved back to Nord-Aurdal, worked as an attorney and built the Labour Party organization in the region. The background formed him in that his main political goal was to improve the economy of dwellers in rural farming districts. He was a proponent of economic regulation, which marked his period as Minister of Finance. However, his period was also marked by the dominance of Erik Brofoss and the Ministry of Trade in deciding the country's overall financial policy. When Trygve Bratteli succeeded Meisdalshagen as Minister of Finance, the ministry regained its dominance, but also set out on a gradual deregulation. This, in addition to Meisdalshagen's discontent with increased spendings on defence, made him an oppositional figure within the Labour Party. He did return briefly to cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, and also cooperated with the government through the position as chairman of Norges Kooperative Landsforening, a national association of consumer co-operatives. However his oppositional tendencies grew stronger in his later life. He was a part of the \"Easter Uprising\" in 1958, and in 1958 and 1959 there were rumours of Meisdalshagen worked behind the scene to facilitate a change of personnel—and policy—in the Labour Party. His death came in this period."

Vagheesam Pillai from Congress party was the second winner in both elections. He was a member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council between 1926 and 1932 and again between 1936 and 1947. After Independence, he was elected to the Assembly from the Chidambaram constituency and continued as a member till his death in 1959. Though a strong votary of Annamalai University, he criticised the institution on the floor of the Council when it spent more on teaching languages and subjects other than Tamil. He wondered whether a music department was necessary when people did not have food to eat. Early life of Swami : Born as Munusami in Pudupakkam near Arani in 1890, he was rechristened Sigamani in a Christian missionary school in Tindivanam. “He quit school when there was an attempt to convert him and other students to Christianity. He was forced to repay the money the school had spent on his food,” Sahajananda’s family migrated to Kolar in search of a livelihood and he was attracted to spiritualism there. He established contact with many spiritual leaders, and one of them, Karapadi Swami in Vyasarpadi, advised him to work for the welfare of Sambavars ( Paraiyars) in Chidambaram. It was he who named him Sahajananda. He established a mutt and a trust in the name of Nandanar, a medieval Paraiyar devotee and one of the 63 Saivite saints, in Chidambaram in 1916. Twenty-five students were admitted to his school. “He advocated education for Scheduled Caste girls. Mahatma Gandhi visited the school in 1926 and again in 1934. He mobilised funds for the family of freedom fighter V.O. Chidambaram Pillai,” He travelled to Singapore and Malaysia to give lectures on Saiva Siddantha. When there was opposition to Hindi, he spoke in support of teaching the language. He wanted Parayars to learn more languages, arguing that it would liberate them. In his institution, he taught Sanskrit to all students,”"

Sharwan Kumar was born in a family of farmers in a small village called Ghardu Ki Dhani in Surajgarh. He started his political career at a young age and was elected Sarpanch of his Village. He first fought MLA election in 1993 from Pilani and won as an independent candidate. In 2008 Legislative Assembly Elections, he changed his constituency from Pilani to Surajgarh due to Reservation of Pilani Seat. He again won from Surajgarh beating Bhartiya Janta Party Candidate Santosh Ahlawat over a margin of nearly 8000 Votes. He again fought MLA elections in 2013 but lost to BJP candidate Santosh Ahlawat with over 50,000 Votes. His loss came as a surprise among the people and that too, with such a huge margin. Since Santosh Ahlawat became an MP, the Surajgarh assembly seat again went to poll on 13 September 2014."

He was the Labor member for Arafura in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 1987 until his death in 1992. Tipiloura was born on Bathurst Island. He attended primary school there, before studying for two years at St John's College, Darwin and two years at Monivae College in Victoria. He worked for the CSIRO in Darwin after leaving school, and was a successful amateur footballer with St Mary's Football Club; he also played a stint for South Adelaide Football Club in South Australia in the late 1970s. He returned to Bathurst Island in 1975, where he worked in various roles, including for the Nguiu Council, of which he would subsequently be elected President. He returned to Nguiu permanently in 1980, where served as a police aide and then officer at Nguiu from 1980 to 1905. At the time of his election to parliament, he was also the president of the newly elected local branch of the Labor Party. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Arafura at the 1987 election, succeeding his brother-in-law and former Labor leader Bob Collins, who was contesting a seat in the Australian Senate. Tipiloura's election made him, at the time, one of the parliament's only Aboriginal members. Upon his election, he was appointed shadow minister for local government, administrative services, libraries, conservation, museums, and police, fire and emergency services. He contracted kidney failure shortly after his election, and spent some time on dialysis before his uncle donated a kidney in 1990. He was re-elected at the 1990 election from his hospital bed, and was made shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs after the election. However, the disease did not rescind and he died in Melbourne in 1992, aged 35. Tipiloura was the first serving member of the Northern Territory Parliament to die."

He was chairperson of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (1983–1986), president of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties (1985–1987), a member of the Criminal Law Sub-Committee of the Bar Association of Queensland and of the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council (1988–1989) and National President of the Labor Lawyers Association (1989). In 1989, Foley was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as the Labor member for Yeronga. From 1992 onward, Foley served as Attorney-General of Queensland and Minister for the Arts, among other roles, in the Wayne Goss Government. In opposition from 1996-1998, Foley was Shadow Attorney-General. When Labor won government under Peter Beattie in 1998, Foley was appointed Minister for the Arts, Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. At the 2001 election, his seat was abolished and he successfully contested Yeerongpilly. Judge Roslyn Atkinson has credited Foley, in his role as Queensland Attorney-General, with making the Bench more inclusive and representative of wider society, and specifically appointing more women to the Bench.  After the election, he became Minister for Employment, Training and Youth, keeping his responsibility for the Arts but leaving his legal portfolios. Foley retired from politics in 2004."

  "text" : "M.G.Sankar Reddiyar, a visionary and a legendary philanthropist was an entrepreneur turned politician with the vision to serve the rural masses. He served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly thrice during his lifetime. He was elected to Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly from Nanguneri constituency in 1952, 1957 and 1962 elections as an Indian National Congress candidate. Born to Shri.Kuruvaiya Reddiar and Smt.Subbammal, he went to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to pursue his studies. The entrepreneurial spirit within him inspired Shri. M G Sankarto venture into a soft beverages business. His beverages branded as “Vimto House” won the hearts of the British Army who were serving in the island during that time. His business grew and gathered roots in the island. On his return to India, he settled down near Nanguneri and continued his acts of entrepreneurship and philanthropy. He played a key role in the construction of Manimuttar dam which was proposed by the British Government and was left untouched. Now Manimuttar dam feeds more than 30 thousand acres in Naguneri and Rathapuram taluks, without which the whole area would have been dry and unimproved. Shri.Sankar was the key influence behind the ChittaruPattinangal Water Scheme that was developed in Rathapuram taluk by the then Government. His untiring efforts made this scheme happen which came as a boon to the erstwhile rain fed areas in the taluk, helping irrigation and human consumption. He invested his time and resources in building schools for the economically deprived. He constructed a building for the school at Naguneri and donated it to the government. Today the school has grown to become a Higher Secondary School bearing his name. He also made the following contributions in the field of education: • In addition he donated 26 acres of land to the government in construction of buildings in the name of Guru Sankar Government High School. Now it has become a Higher Secondary School.                      • He has also contributed 25 acres of land and constructed buildings for basic teachers training school which is now functioning as “DIET” District Institute of Education and Training. On the social front, Shri. M G Sankar was instrumental in constructing link roads between villages. The drinking water wells were provided under rural development scheme under his leadership are still yielding. He also created vast acres of farms to encourage agriculture in the region that helped the otherwise arid region become self-reliant. Thousands of families benefitted from the employment opportunities the farms provided. Shri.Sankar virtually brought about an economical revolution in the little town of Nanguneri in Tirunelveli district and the surrounding villages though his undaunted efforts and spirit of social consciousness. Service to humanity was the sole purpose of Shri. M G Sankar’s life and this prompted him to join the Indian National Congress and he went on to become the representative of the local people. He was elected as the member of legislative assembly of the then Nanguneri Constituency thrice and worked tirelessly for the upliftment of the people and his constituency. Sankar Reddiar died on 25 December 1962 while serving his third term."

In 1941, during World War II, Montiljo and his family were imprisoned at the Sarajevo camp. Montiljo later escaped to Dalmatia, where in 1943 he was again imprisoned, but this time at the Rab concentration camp. After successful escape in September 1943, he joined the Partisans. After the war, Montiljo attended and finished the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb. For more than 30 years he worked on the protocol and consular affairs for the Socialist Republic of Croatia government. He was engaged in international public law as a consultant and assistant foreign relations. From 1990 to 1992, Montiljo worked as assistant to foreign minister of Croatia. Montiljo founded the \"Croatian-Israeli society\", choir \"Lira\", and was active member of the Jewish Community in Zagreb before he founded the Jewish community \"Bet Israel\" with Ivo and Slavko Goldstein. For his cultural contribution, Montiljo was awarded with Order of Danica Hrvatska by President of Croatia Stjepan Mesić. Montiljo died in Zagreb on December 17, 2006 and was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery."

  "text" : "Frances Nunziata is a Toronto city councillor for Ward 11 York South-Weston (representing one of the two York South—Weston wards). She is the sister of former Member of Parliament John Nunziata. An accounting clerk, she became head of the Harwood Ratepayers Association. She was first elected to office in 1985 as school board trustee for the City of York School Board. In 1988 she was elected to the York city council ousting incumbent Gary Bloor. On city council she rose to prominence as a whistleblower in the Fairbank Park affair. A deal had been made to sell part of the city park to a developer to build condominiums. Nunziata leaked material to the press illustrating irregularities in the process, leading to a police investigation of several local politicians. The affair pitted Nunziata against almost the entire York city council in a bitter debate. Nunziata took fellow councillor Nicolo Fortunato to court after he reportedly called her a \"slut\" and threatened to kill her. In the 1991 elections Nunziata was vindicated as six of the eight sitting councillors lost their reelection bids while Nunziata defeated her nearest rival by a ten to one margin. Eventually two York city councillors, one Metro Toronto councillor, and the developer were jailed over the affair. In the 1994 election Nunziata chose to challenge York mayor Fergy Brown. Nunziata was considered unlikely to defeat the incumbent, but after a spirited and often bitter campaign she emerged victorious. As mayor she ran into her own ethics issues when it was alleged she had used city money to pay a political operative. As mayor her main cause was an unsuccessful campaign to construct a subway line under Eglinton avenue. With the creation of the megacity in 1997 she was elected to Toronto city council. On city council she mostly concerned herself with law and order issues. She also was a prominent defender of Kimberley Glasco in her battle with the National Ballet of Canada. In 2010, George Berger, an executive assistant who worked for her in 2005 brought her before a human rights tribunal claiming harassment and discrimination during his employment. Berger claims that he was targeted due to a disability. Nunziata denies the claim. Berger is asking for monetary compensation and an apology. On December 7, 2010 she was nominated by Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday and elected as Speaker of Toronto City Council."

Upon his death, the Oakland City Council voted unanimously to rename City Hall Plaza in his honor as the Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. The plaza displays a bronze bust of Ogawa. A Nisei, Ogawa was born in Lodi, California and never lived in Japan. Nevertheless, as Japanese Americans, the U.S. government involuntarily relocated Ogawa's family members to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Millard County, Utah and they were detained there for the duration of World War II. Ogawa married Grace Ogawa (née Hiruma) prior to their wartime detention and they had two children—Alan and Nancy. Nancy was born in the Topaz War Relocation Center but died at age 2. After the war, Ogawa returned to Oakland where he found work as a gardener. Eventually, he borrowed and saved enough money to open his own nursery. When Ogawa died, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, in her Tribute to Frank H. Ogawa, said: \"Frank Ogawa was a remarkable person because he could take personal misfortune and turn it into a positive learning experience for himself and others. When Frank and Grace Ogawa were forced to sell their belongings and live in internment camps during World War II, they had to sleep on straw mattresses in horse stalls for six months before beingshipped to a camp in Utah to spend another 3 1/2 years in confinement. Despite this mistreatment and injustice, he never lost faith in the United States. Just the opposite--he strived to prove his loyalty to his country and became an internationally recognized champion of Asian-Americans in the process.\" She went on to say \"Having served five years on the Oakland Parks Commission, Frank Ogawa was elected to the city council in 1966, making him the first Japanese-American to hold a council seat in a major city in the continental United States. He held that position for 28 years until his passing -- the longest tenure in Oakland's history.\" Ogawa was a member of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) from 1972 to 1988, having been appointed to the Commission by the Association of Bay Area Governments. Ogawa served on the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Board of Directors from 1979 until 1992 when he had to retire from the Board because of health issues. He served as Chairman of the Board during most of 1987 and served as Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board's Executive Committee and Personnel Committee. Ogawa was a Republican. However, he never held nor was he ever a candidate for any partisan office. As a public official, Ogawa was known as kind, optimistic, and adept at building consensus. In about December 1988, Ogawa underwent successful heart surgery. Ogawa died in Oakland on July 13, 1994, of lung cancer. He was survived by his wife Grace, son Alan, and by two grandchildren, Courtney and Matthew. More than 600 people, including a representative of Oakland's sister city of Fukuoka, Japan, attended Ogawa's memorial service."

  "text" : "Georges-Casimir Dessaulles (September 29, 1827–April 19, 1930), was a Canadian businessman, statesman and senator. Dessaulles holds the record for the oldest serving politician. Appointed to the Canadian Senate representing the Province of Quebec in 1907 at age 80, Dessaulles served for 23 years before dying at age 102. Dessaulles was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Lower Canada in 1827, the son of Jean Dessaulles and a nephew of Louis-Joseph Papineau. Before becoming senator, Dessaulles was president of the Bank of Saint-Hyacinthe, and mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe. He also represented Saint-Hyacinthe in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1897 to 1900. He was a last-minute candidate for the provincial seat, having been nominated after the death of the previous candidate, his son-in-law Maurice St-Jacques. In 1857, he had married Émilie-Emma, the daughter of judge Dominique Mondelet; in 1869, he married Louise-Frances Leman after the death of his first wife. His 100th birthday was marked as a historic moment in the senate, because Dessaulles had become only the second sitting senator to reach the age of 100 (the other being David Wark). At his death in 1930, Dessaulles was the oldest sitting politician in the world. To date, no one has beaten this record. Dessaulles is also renowned for only having spoken twice while serving as a Senator. Once to deny that his appointment was part of a corrupt bargain, and a second time to thank his fellow senators for his portrait, on his 100th birthday. His daughter Henriette Dessaulles became a noted writer and journalist."

Nevertheless, he was re-elected. He opposed the amalgamation of Scarborough, Toronto, and four other municipalities in 1997, but after it occurred he ran for a seat on Toronto city council in Ward 13. The ward structure at the time was such that the two candidates who received the most votes were elected in each riding. He was elected along with Brian Ashton. Fellow Scarborough city councillor Fred Johnson came in third. He has chaired the Planning and Transportation Committee. A centrist, he was aligned with the Liberal Party.

He served as Labor's whip while the party was in Opposition during the 1990s. On 13 May 2006, The Age newspaper in Melbourne published two articles alleging Seitz had been involved in branch stacking within his electorate, using the proceeds of community bingo games and a rental apartment to pay for memberships to the Labor Party. It was alleged that Seitz used his influence within the ALP to secure 2007 pre-selection for prominent Labor Right faction leader Bill Shorten to run for Federal Parliament (Seitz is a member of the Labor Unity faction, within Labor Right), and in return a Shorten-led party administrative committee allowed Seitz to continue serving in Victorian Parliament past the usual retirement age of 65. Former Victorian Premier John Cain said of Seitz, \"His parliamentary career is eminently forgettable. I think the most I can say is that he was a backbench warrior who was out there in the local electorate doing a lot of branch-stacking and enjoying it.\" Seitz has denied The Age's allegations. He died in 2015."

  "text" : "Khwaja Ghulam Ahmad Ashai (Arabic: غولم أحمد أشي) was a Kashmiri bureaucrat and political leader. He was the grandson of Rayees-ul-Waqt Hajji Mukhthar Shah Ashai. The 'Ashai Bagh Bridge' over Nigeen Lake and Dal Lake is named after Ashai's ancestors. Before moving to suburban Srinagar, the Ashais lived at the 'Ashai Kocha' in Fateh Kadal, Srinagar. The historic Ashai mansion now hosts a Girl's high school. Ashai's hut in Raj Bagh has been converted into a hotel. Popularly known as Ashai Sahib by his colleagues, political contemporaries and subordinates, Ghulam Ahmad Ashai was the first Kashmiri Muslim to attain a bachelor's degree. In reward for his service and academic achievements, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah appointed Ghulam Ahmad Ashai as the first Registrar of the University of Kashmir, both for academic and administrative matters, from 1948 to 1953. He led the first convocation of the University of Kashmir at Sher-e-Kashmir (Lion of Kashmir) Park and was followed by a distinguished panel including the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and the Pro-Indian Sheikh Abdullah. Ashai's involvement with Kashmir University started when he was appointed as the Special Officer assigned with the responsibility of starting Kashmir's first university. Ashai spent the next two years touring universities across India building up strategic ties and relations with renowned and established universities. In the 1980 Sheikh Abdullah's National Conference government, in recognition of Ashai’s contributions as founding registrar designated the main road leading to the present university campus in Hazratbal as Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road. A commemorative plaque was installed at the entrance of the university, but it has since been removed. The family claims that illegal orders were given to have the plaque removed and the road christening annulled. However, according to official papers, the road is still legally named as \"Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road\"."

He was re-elected for Maidstone in the 1852 general election but his election was declared void on petition, and a by-election was held on 22 April 1853. He was one of the Gentlemen of Her Majesty's privy chamber from 1844. Dodd married Georgiana Sanders, daughter of Joseph Sanders. They had one son, George Ashley Dodd, born 29 Sept 1842. In 1865 Thomas Allom was commissioned to design a mausoleum for George Dodd at West Norwood Cemetery. The mausoleum is in the form of a small Gothic chapel with coloured marble, suggesting a north Italian inspiration for the design, and is now a Grade II listed building. It has been suggested that Dodd had bought sixteen houses designed by Thomas Allom in Kensington Park Gardens and wanted his mausoleum to be designed by the same architect."

He became a mining speculator on the Croydon goldfields and then set up his own forge in Tambo, Queensland to service mining operations in the local region. He became involved in local politics for the Australian Labor Party, and in 1893 he was elected to represent the electoral district of Barcoo in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and served in that post until 1909. He rose to senior positions within the party, culminating in his election as leader of the Queensland Parliamentary Labor Party in 1904 after the death of his predecessor William Henry Brown. Kerr's leadership was complicated by a split in the party in 1905 in which he and other senior Labor figures opted to form a coalition with the Liberal Party to achieve statewide reforms. Although initially he commanded the confidence of the party, a state conference of the party in 1907 rejected Kerr's leadership and the Liberal-Labor coalition, opting to go into the 1907 state election alone. Kerr continued in parliament as an independent Labor member but was challenged by official Labor candidates until his defeat in his seat in 1909. He died on 18 January 1930 in Brisbane and was buried in Toowong Cemetery."

In April 1901, Blum was elected Eau Claire County Judge and served in that capacity for 38 years. A special act of the Wisconsin State Legislature in 1927 greatly increased his powers and jurisdiction. Blum was heavily involved in the business community of the Chippewa Valley. In 1919, Judge Blum bought the Laycock and Drummond blocks of Eau Claire, Wisconsin for over $80,000 dollars. This was one of the largest real estate transfer deals in the history of the city. Blum was one of the founders of the Walter Brewing Company and Consumers Tire & Tube Company. Blum also served as director of the Union National Bank and of the Union Mortgage Loan Company until January 1, 1934. Judge Blum married Margaret D. McGillis and had two daughters and one son; Margaret, Genevieve, and George L., Jr. Blum died of heart disease in 1939."

He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly since 1990, representing the electorate of Thomastown. He served most recently as Minister for Energy and Resources and Minister for Community Development. He was Minister for Transport from 1999 to 2006. Prior to entering politics he was the state secretary of the Australian Labor Party from 1983 to 1990. Before that he worked for a time at the Furnishing Trades Union. While state secretary of the Labor Party, Batchelor was involved in a scandal surrounding the 1985 Nunawading by-election. He was accused of distributing misleading how-to-vote cards which claimed to be a vote for \"nuclear disarmament\", leading voters to conclude they were voting for the Nuclear Disarmament Party.  Unilateral nuclear disarmament was a popular cause within the Left during the 1980s. Police investigated the matter and Batchelor was not charged with any criminal offence. The biggest project undertaken in transport while Batchelor was minister was the $750 million Regional Fast Rail project. In 2000 the State Government approved funding to upgrade rail lines to provide fast rail passenger services between Melbourne and Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and Traralgon. The Victorian Auditor General noted that in spite of money spent, the \"average journey time savings for all passengers using these services are likely to be more modest than implied by the government’s target journey times\". On 7 October 2010, Batchelor announced that he would not re-contest his seat at the 2010 state election and he retired at that election. In February, 2012, Peter Batchelor was appointed President of the Community Broadcasting Foundation. The Foundation, based in Melbourne, is the independent funding body for Australian community radio and television, distributing more than $15m of federal grant monies annually."

She is a Hindi poet and social worker. Thakur was a member of 12th Lok Sabha from Ajmer constituency in Rajasthan from 1998 to 1999. In 2009, she was openly critical of the Left Front rule of the state of Bengal, saying that crimes against women have been growing in the previous 33 years of rule. In 2014, she was part of a group of women who supported an Aam Sabha for the 33% Women's Reservation Bill. She stated that the bill would help \"empower Indian women socially, economically and politically.\" Thakur has spoken out on other women's issues, calling for stricter anti-rape provisions in India. Thakur was also a supporter of laws against 'honour killings.' She has responded to comments about implementing dress codes to combat incidents of rape and has been quoted saying, \"The question is not about the dress code, but the mentality of men. What the girls should wear should be the concern of the girl, her parents and her family only. I don't think there is a need for anyone else to say anything about how a girl should behave.\" Thakur believes instead, that as more women see rapists being dealt \"justice,\" they will be more likely to file cases against assailants. She has previously spoken out about the amount of violent crime against women in Delhi."

In late 2008, Gray earned himself some bad publicity when he was accused of two separate instances of \"bullying\", both of them against elderly women. In the first instance he threaten to sue an outspoken constituent who, at a public meeting in November 2008, said she would not be voting for Gray. This was followed in December by a legal threat against a Labor member, from whom he demanded $10,000 and an apology, for criticising him in an internal party report. His behaviour was denounced by Premier Anna Bligh and Gray was forced to publicly apologise for his actions. The 2009 state election pitted Gray against Alex Douglas for the third consecutive time. On this occasion, Douglas, running under the banner of the newly formed Liberal National Party, narrowly emerged as the victor. Following his defeat, Gray angrily slammed what he perceived as negative and \"biased\" coverage of him by the Gold Coast Bulletin."

She was elected at the 1949 federal election, the second Liberal woman to be elected to the Senate. In 1955, Robertson was dropped from the Liberal Senate ticket for that year's election, with opponents citing her age; she was 73 at that election, and would be 79 at the conclusion of that term. She resigned from the Liberal Party, joined their coalition partner the Country Party, and headed their two-member Senate ticket at the election. She was re-elected after a \"vigorous\" campaign, making speeches across rural South Australia and on radio, and ultimately defeating the third Liberal candidate on preferences. She retired at the conclusion of that term in 1962. Robertson is regarded as the first woman to represent the Country (later National) Party in the Parliament of Australia."

On council, she spearheaded expansion of child care spaces, advocated that transit money to be spent on buses rather than mega-projects such as RAV (now called the Canada Line), and convinced a majority of city council to deny Wal-Mart's application to build a new store. Roberts also opposed expanded gambling in the city and the 2010 Olympics. Roberts ran for re-election in 2005 placing 19th among 36 candidates with 41,739 votes, thus losing her seat."

Before being elected to Parliament, Haermeyer worked for the Victorian ALP Head Office and for Senator Robert Ray, a senior federal cabinet minister at the time. Haermeyer's political campaigning skills were much respected after he unexpectedly won the Yan Yean seat in 1992, despite a massive landslide against Labor at that election. He served as Labor's Shadow Police Minister from 1996 and was instrumental in making law and order positive issues for his party, traditionally an area of conservative strength. He forged close ties with the Police Association, which represents police officers and was able to successfully draw attention to the then Kennett government's cutbacks on spending on the Police. In early 1999, he was instrumental in removing then Opposition Leader John Brumby and electing his successor Steve Bracks. When Labor did surprisingly well in the election later that year, it was soon able to form a government and Haermeyer was one of its more senior ministers, in the Police and Emergency Services portfolios. He presided over the hiring over 800 new Police officers. Later he became Victorian Minister for Manufacturing & Export, Minister for Small Business and Minister for Financial Services between 21 January 2005 and 1 December 2006. Haermeyer resigned from parliament on 2 June 2008. A by-election for the seat was held on 28 June"

He spent time in southern and eastern Africa as a miner and prospector before returning to Australia to farm. In 1966, he became New South Wales State Chairman of the Young Australian Country Party, holding the position until 1968 when he was appointed to the state council, serving until 1984. He was elected to Carrathool Shire Council in 1970 and remained until 1974. He was chairman of the Rankins Springs branch of the party from 1972 to 1984. In 1984, Cruickshank was selected as the National candidate for the state seat of Murrumbidgee, which was being vacated by sitting Labor member Lin Gordon. Cruickshank finished third on the primary votes behind Labor candidate Margaret Delves and independent Thomas Marriott, but with Liberal preferences pushed into second place and was elected the victor on Marriott's preferences, with a margin of 51.52%. Partly due to redistributions which greatly strengthened the National Party in Murrumbidgee, Cruickshank faced no further serious challenges and was re-elected in 1988, 1991, and 1995. He retired in 1999 and was succeeded as National MP for the seat by Adrian Piccoli. On 21 May 2010, Cruickshank died at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital from pneumonia."

He was elected to the position by the Free State Legislature on 6 May 2009, replacing Beatrice Marshoff. In April 2015 it was reported that R8 million of taxpayer's money had been spent in the 2011/12 financial year on aesthetic renovations to his official residence. In December 2015, the Free State province purchased a luxury Mercedes-Benz costing R2.3m, including a panoramic sunroof and entertainment centre. Shortly before, six luxury Mercedes costing R3.2 million had been purchased and handed over to traditional leaders. The opposition Democratic Alliance responded by claiming that Magshule was turning the province into a \"banana republic\". The House of Traditional Leaders chairperson King Lelika Moloi stated that the cars did not serve as a bribe to secure votes for the following year's local elections. Since he took office he has changed the face of the Free State province for the better. Magashule has ensured that thousands of students are awarded with bursaries to study in universities across South Africa as well as abroad."
