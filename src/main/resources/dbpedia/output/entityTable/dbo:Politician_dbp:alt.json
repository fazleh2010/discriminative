  "text" : "William John Harper (22 July 1916 – 8 September 2006) was a politician, general contractor and Royal Air Force fighter pilot who served as a Cabinet minister in Rhodesia (or Southern Rhodesia) from 1962 to 1968, and signed that country's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from Britain in 1965. Born into a prominent Anglo-Indian merchant family in Calcutta, Harper was educated in India and England and joined the RAF in 1937. He served as an officer throughout the Second World War and saw action as one of \"The Few\" in the Battle of Britain, during which he was wounded in action. Appalled by Britain's granting of independence to India in 1947, he emigrated to Rhodesia on retiring from the air force two years later. Harper contended that British rule in the subcontinent should never have ended, and took a similar stance regarding his adopted homeland, reportedly declaring that it, South Africa and the neighbouring Portuguese territories would \"be under white rule forever\". He entered politics with the Dominion Party in 1958 and became Minister of Irrigation, Roads and Road Traffic in the Rhodesian Front (RF) government in 1962. The head of a far-right group within the RF, he called for Rhodesia to abolish black representation in parliament and adopt \"a form of political apartheid\". When the Prime Minister Winston Field resigned in 1964, Harper was a front-runner to succeed him, but lost out to Ian Smith, who moved him to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Each breakdown or setback during the early years of Smith's premiership prompted press speculation that Harper might replace him. In 1966, when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Harper led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to their rejection. Harper resigned from the Rhodesian Front in 1968, soon after Smith dismissed him from the Cabinet, reportedly because Harper had had an extramarital affair with a British agent. He subsequently became a vocal critic of the Prime Minister, greeting each step Smith made towards settlement with black nationalists during the Bush War with public indignation. By the time majority rule began in Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement of the previous year, Harper had left for South Africa. He died in 2006 at the age of 90."

Like many Buffalo Democrats, including Buffalo Mayors Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, Gorski was known for being more conservative than the mainstream Democratic Party platform, and was regularly cross-endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York. As county executive, he rivaled his contemporary Buffalo Mayors and on some issues his contemporary New York State Governors in power: He succeeded in bringing the World University Games to Buffalo, and since the National Football League Buffalo Bills play in suburban Orchard Park, New York it was his responsibility to broker a deal to keep the team from leaving town. He also helped the National Hockey League Buffalo Sabres finance Marine Midland Arena (now known as First Niagara Center). During his early years he brought about economic recovery and kept the county on solid financial footing during his tenure. He has been described as the only County Executive to balance the budget. Gorski is a Vietnam War veteran and remained active in Veteran's affairs while in office. Since leaving the county executive's office, he has worked in private business in Buffalo, New York. Gorski spent his first nine years of public life working for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) and was subsequently was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo."

  "text" : "Herbert Charles Wilson (December 7, 1859 – December 17, 1909) was a Canadian politician and physician. He served as mayor of the Town of Edmonton and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories. Wilson was born in 1859 in what would become the province of Ontario. The son of a manufacturer, Wilson's family had extensive business interests in the area of Picton, Ontario. Wilson studied medicine and moved to Edmonton in 1882, one of the first physicians to settle there. He was appointed to official medical positions and, for several years, owned a drugstore in town. He served as a consultant to First Nations reserves near Edmonton and also became a director of many local corporations. He was elected to the Territorial council in 1885, and soon became its speaker. During his speakership, he helped to change the council's rules and procedures. He left territorial politics after six years, citing health reasons. He maintained a medical practice in town for many years, and went to considerable efforts to keep up with the latest practices. Wilson interested himself in civic activities in Edmonton, and eventually ran for mayor, winning election in 1895. He left office after less than two years in a dispute over town funds. He attempted a comeback in 1904, but was defeated in a run for the town council. He married in 1886, and had a son and two daughters. He died in 1909; an industrial park in the city is named for him."

He was a Member of Parliament from 1960 to 1991, being elected as a candidate of the left wing AKEL party. He was Secretary General of the Pancyprian Federation of Labour (PEO) from 1943 to 1986. His contribution to the development of labour relations and labour legislation in Cyprus has been crucial and many consider him the person with the most significant role in shaping the trade union movement on the island. Legislations such as the Social Security Law of Cyprus in 1956 (Πρώτος Νόμος Περί Κοινωνικών Ασφαλίσεων, Νόμος Αρ. 31 του 1956), the introduction of the Cost of Living Allowance, the eight-hour working day and the forty hour working week, legislation on unfair dismissal and the labour disputes tribunals, the shaping of the collective agreements in many sectors of economic activity as well as the tripartite cooperation between trade unions, employers’ organisations and government all bear his mark. He first joined the outlawed Communist Party of Cyprus in 1939 and became a member of left wing AKEL party in 1941 upon its foundation.He was Secretary General of the Pancyprian Trade Union Committee, the first coordinating body of trade unions in Cyprus and the precursor of PEO. He was accused along with all the Committee members for sedition and insurrection against the Colonial order and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment in 1946. This was a major political trial of the colonial era and his address to the court was a memorable anti-colonial statement. Andreas Ziartides participated as the Cypriot representative in the founding congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) held in 1945 in London. He served on the General Council and the Executive Committee of the WFTU for many years and was its Vice President for a while. In the early nineties he, along with others in the AKEL leadership, disagreed with the line followed by the Party and was dismissed from his leadership position. This led to his and others’ departure from AKEL and the formation of ADESOK, in Greek: ΑΔΗΣΟΚ (Ανανεωτικό Δημοκρατικό Σοσιαλιστικό Κόμμα), a reformist leftist party. ADESOK was later merged with Free Democrats Movement (founded by former President of Cyprus George Vassiliou) and formed a new party named United Democrats. A form of interview/biography of Andreas Ziartides was authored by Panikos Paionides in his book \"Ανδρέας Ζιαρτίδης: Χωρίς φόβο και πάθος\" Television interviews of Andreas Ziartides were documented by journalist Pavlos Pavlou (Greek: Παύλος Παύλου) in his book Dimosia Katathesi (Greek: Δημόσια Κατάθεση)."
