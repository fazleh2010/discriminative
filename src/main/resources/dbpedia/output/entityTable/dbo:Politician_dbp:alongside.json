There was a great depression during the mid-1860s and Bathgate had lost money to the Commercial Banking Co., and had allowed the Southland Provincial Council to overdraw well beyond the agreed limit. These events put an end to Bathgate's banking career. From June 1871 to November 1872, he served on the Executive Council of the Otago Province. He represented two Dunedin electorates in the House of Representatives, first the City of Dunedin electorate from 1871 to 1874, when he resigned to take up the offer by Premier Julius Vogel of resident magistrate in Dunedin and district judge for Otago, and the Roslyn electorate from 1881 to 1884, when he was defeated.

Taylor's family emigrated to New Zealand in 1849 and he was a sheep farmer in various parts of the South Island before finally settling on a run near Riverton in Southland, where he had his homestead 'Waldeck' built. He entered the House of Representatives for the Dunedin Country electorate through a by-election in 1858 but fell out with many of his constituents over a broken election promise, as he helped the Southland Province to break away from the Otago Province. He eventually became Southland's second Superintendent and served from 1865 to 1869, and also represented an electorate on the Southland Provincial Council for a few months. In 1865, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council and with one break in membership due to non-attendance, he remained a member until his death. He served for one year as mayor of Riverton (1872–73) but did not stand again due to poor health. Taylor had a painful illness and died in 1875."

His father's family were publishers to the University of Edinburgh. After receiving a good education, McGlashan worked in the book trade. Inspired by his brother's work as secretary for the Otago Association, he decided to emigrate and left in 1848. He went to Adelaide in South Australia, then Melbourne and finally Sydney, where he sold the books that he took with him for a good profit. There, he purchased provisions that he took with himself to Dunedin in 1850, which he could once again sell at a good profit. In 1853, he was joined in Dunedin by his older brother, John McGlashan. Edward McGlashan worked at first as a registrar at the Supreme Court under Justice Sidney Stephen. He then leased a flour mill from William Henry Valpy on the Water of Leith. He also had a store and auction room in Princes Street. From 1858 until 1862, when the Otago Gold Rush began, he was in partnership with W. Carr Young, and they traded as Young and McGlashan. McGlashan visited England in 1862. Edward McGlashan stood for election in the first Otago Provincial Council, and represented the Dunedin Country electorate from 28 September 1853 to 15 September 1855. He was unsuccessful at some later provincial elections. In 1865, he contested the superintendancy, but was beaten by Thomas Dick. He would later represent the North Harbour electorate in the 6th and 7th council, from 17 March 1871 until the abolition of the provincial governments on 31 October 1876. He represented the City of Dunedin electorate from the 1860 general election to 1862 when he resigned; and then the Roslyn electorate from the 1871 general election to 1875, when he resigned. McGlashan had various business interests later in life. He dealt in stock and farmland, and owned Mount Stokes station. He owned steamers and was milling in The Catlins. He started to manufacture paper, but was unsuccessful in making it from tussock grasses. He moved to Timaru for some years and was a director of a number of companies, including a major shareholder in the New Zealand Shipping Company. After a long visit to England from 1881, he returned to Dunedin to live in St Clair. McGlashan married twice, and his second wife was Henrietta, the daughter of George Bell; they married on 10 March 1880. McGlashan's health was poor for his last few years. He died on 31 July 1889 at his residence in St Clair, and was survived by his second wife."

Barff was born in the English county of Kent on 5 March 1833, probably at Lee (now part of Greater London), where he was baptised five months later. He first came to New Zealand to join the West Coast Gold Rush in the mid-1860s. The West Coast was initially part of the Canterbury Province and following a requisition in October 1865, he was first elected as the member of the West Coast Goldfields electorate in the following month. Barff and Evan Prosser, who was elected at the same time, were the first members from the West Coast on the Canterbury Provincial Council. In July 1866, Barff became a member for the Westland electorate. He remained a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council until December 1867. The Westland district separated from the Canterbury Province on 1 January 1868, and Barff joined the Westland County, which was the predecessor to Westland Province. During the existence of Westland County (January 1868 – November 1873), Barff represented the ridings of Westland, Ōkārito, and Arahura. He did not join the Westland Provincial Council, but stood for the first election in January 1874 as one of three candidates in the two-member Arahura electorate (incorrectly referred to as 'Waimea' in some sources). Much to his surprise, he was defeated with 120 votes by Richard Seddon and Houlahan, who were equal at 145 votes. He represented the Westland South electorate in the House of Representatives from 1868 to 1870, when he was defeated for Hokitika by John White. He then represented the Hokitika electorate from 1876 to 1879, when he was again defeated. Barff died in Kumara in 1882; he had never married."

He relocated to Auckland in 1841, where he became a member of the New Zealand Parliament. Biography Porter was born in London in 1784. He married Alice Roper in Liverpool (c. 1811), with whom he had four children. Porter became a prominent sea captain, operating a small fleet out of his own yard at Liverpool. He and other members of the Porter family sailed for the British East India Company (e.g. his cousin, George Porter). In the late 1830s he suffered substantial losses at sea, which his son said were behind his decision to migrate. Porter sold his shipyard in Liverpool and took two of his ships, Porter, and Dorset, provisioned with livestock and a range of personnel (including a doctor, tutors and servants), so that he could set up a relatively self-sufficient farming station at Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula. Porter himself captained his namesake, the Porter (a 252-ton brig), which he had built in 1824 and which had been strengthened so that it would be fit for the hazardous voyage. Upon arrival, he used this vessel to set up a shipping service from Port Lincoln and Adelaide to and from other Australian and New Zealand ports. Porter also built the Dorset (95 tons) in 1838, specifically as a back-up ship for the journey to Australia. This was sold upon arrival. Porter’s expedition arrived at Port Lincoln in early 1839. The party was just one of three to arrive with settlers for the district in the 1830s and 1840s. It became apparent to him that Adelaide would be the main settlement in South Australia and that immediate prospects for Port Lincoln would be limited. Impatient for success, he decided to forego the significant investment and effort he had made in the fledgling settlement (e.g. building two houses, establishing a bank and helping build the first Church of England). He abandoned the settlement in 1840. Although Porter’s tenure in Port Lincoln only lasted 18 months, he had, nevertheless, been appointed the first Magistrate of the Eyre Peninsular and his family left its name at ‘Porter Bay’. In May 1841, Porter arrived in New Zealand. Alice was sceptical and had returned to Liverpool with their son, William Field junior. She waited until he was properly settled, before joining him in Auckland. Porter served in the 1st New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Suburbs of Auckland electorate from 1853 to 1855, when he retired, but did not serve in any further Parliaments. He also served on the Auckland Provincial Council. Porter died on 30 March 1869 at Mangatangi, Waikato."

  "text" : "William Thorne Buckland (1819 – 17 January 1876) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament in New Zealand. Buckland was born in 1819 or 1820. His mother was Elizabeth (née Mortimore) and his father was the broker John Buckland; they were from Devon, England. The auctioneer Alfred Buckland was a younger brother. Buckland arrived in New Zealand in 1841 from South Australia, and was a butcher in Auckland, then a farmer in the Waikato. He married Susan Channing on 13 April 1843 at St Paul's Church in Auckland. Buckland was appointed to the Auckland Executive Council of the Auckland Province in November 1856 (the source does not state and end date), and was again appointed from February to July 1857. He was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council for the Raglan electorate in November 1861 and served until 1869. From 1869 to 1873, he represented the Franklin electorate. He had no intention of standing for the Provincial Council again but happened to ride past the nomination meeting in Newmarket for the Eden electorate. There was only one nomination thus far for the two available positions, and Buckland was talked into being nominated. As the number of nominations matched the number of available positions, he was declared elected unopposed, and served until his death. He represented two South Auckland electorates; first the Raglan electorate from 1865 to 1866, when he retired. He then represented the Franklin electorate from 1871 to 1875. He was nominated for the 1876 election and gave a speech at the nomination meeting on 10 January 1876, but withdrew his nomination before the end of the proceedings. The Auckland Star suggested that the sole purpose of his nomination was that he could make a speech in opposition to Sir George Grey. Buckland left for the Waikato immediately afterwards to support Alfred Cox in his candidacy in the Waipa electorate. However, he became ill with symptoms of heat stroke and returned to his home in Remuera. He died at his home in Remuera, Auckland aged 56 years after that brief illness. He was buried at St Stephen's Cemetery in Parnell. His wife had died in September 1871; she had committed suicide after having become depressed. Their sons Frank and John Channing Buckland were both elected to the parliament in the 1884 election. Jessie Buckland was his son John's daughter."

He spent three years in New Zealand as a runholder and during that time, he represented the Christchurch Country electorate in the New Zealand House of Representatives for one term. Brittin was born in Huntingdonshire, England in 1823. He received an education as a solicitor, but during his time in New Zealand, he did not practice in that profession. Brittin came out to New Zealand on the Minerva in 1853, together with his wife, and his brother John Danns Brittin, his wife and son. The Minerva, one of the ships chartered by the Canterbury Association, had left London on 29 September and Plymouth on 12 October 1852, and arrived in Lyttelton on 2 February 1853. Other notable passengers on the ship were Henry Sewell, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, Jane and John Deans, Thomas Rowley, John Cuff, and Elizabeth Torlesse. The Brittin brothers took up run 105 at the mouth of the Rakaia River. They sold their land in 1854, and took land in the Port Hills. In the 1855 election, Brittin was one of four candidates in the two-member Christchurch Country electorate. He came second and represented the electorate in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament in 1856, but resigned during the 1856 session before the end of his term; the Speaker read out his letter of resignation on 31 July, two weeks before the session finished. He had to return to England on 'urgent business' in 1856 and feared that he may not be back in time for the start of the 1857 parliamentary session. In fact, he did not return to New Zealand, and historian George Macdonald noted that he \"was not heard of again\" in Canterbury. The resulting by-election was won by John Ollivier, who beat Crosbie Ward. Brittin died in 1881 and is buried at All Saints, the Parish Church of St Ives. His wife Anna Maria Brittin, who died in 1902, is buried next to him."

He married Elizabeth, a daughter of the late Caleb Coffin of New York on 11 July 1895. They had 3 children, John (1898), Marjorie (1901) and Barbara (1903). Franklin contested the Westhoughton Parliamentary division in 1900, and Stretford in 1901, but on both occasions he was unsuccessful. He became Liberal MP for Leicester at a by-election in 1906, however, sharing the representation of the double-member constituency with Ramsay MacDonald. He retired at the January 1910 election. In 1906, Thomasson ventured on a bold but disastrous experiment in newspaper production by founding the Tribune (1906–1908). He played a large part in local political life before he left Bolton for London. During World War I he commanded the 2-5th Battalion Loyal North Lancashire Regiment. His wife Elizabeth died in 1927 and he then married Gertrude Prescott. They had three children, Margaret (1930), Christopher (1932) and Jenny (1937). Franklin died of cancer on 29 October 1941 aged 68 and was buried at Lyndhurst, Hampshire."

Kay was born in the Sydney suburb of Petersham, New South Wales and educated at Petersham and Stanmore public schools. He worked in a wholesale warehouse and in 1913 married Mary Elizabeth Clasby, a 52-year-old widow with five children (one of her sons, John Clasby, was briefly a federal MP). He was given a state funeral. Alick became a clerk with New South Wales Government Railways and joined the army in 1915. Kay ran unsuccessfully for the federal seat of South Sydney for the Nationalist Party in 1917. In 1918 he left the Nationalists and started appearing regularly as an anti-Communist speaker at Sydney Domain. He also travelled regularly to Melbourne to orate next to the Yarra. In 1925, he won one of the five seats of North Shore under proportional representation in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as an independent. In parliament, he regularly voted with Labor to the horror of his former supporters. Under the electoral system, the Australian Labor Party automatically won his position if he resigned, so Jack Lang offered him a position on the Metropolitan Meat Board in 1926 as a consumers' representative. The Thomas Bavin government passed legislation in 1927 to remove him from the board. After Lang's return to power in 1930, he was reappointed to the board, but was sacked again by the Bertram Stevens government. In 1933, Kay travelled to England. His wife had died and he married Dorothy Edith Gamson at Islington in June 1943. He later claimed to have worked for the British Department of Information during World War II. In 1951, he returned to Sydney, and resumed speaking at the Domain on Sundays. He died in the Sydney suburb of Mosman, survived by his wife."

  "text" : "Arthur James Tyler (26 December 1883 – 20 July 1972) was an Australian politician. He was born in Newcastle, New South Wales. In 1943 he was elected to the Tasmanian Legislative Council as the Labor member for Hobart. His victory had been by only three votes and was declared void by the Supreme Court on a challenge; Tyler won the resulting by-election in January 1944. He was, however, defeated in 1945. He died in Hobart in 1972."
