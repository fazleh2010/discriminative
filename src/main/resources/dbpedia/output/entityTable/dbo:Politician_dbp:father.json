  "text" : "Sir John Lawson Ormrod Andrews KBE DL PC (15 July 1903 – 12 January 1986) was a member of both the Northern Ireland House of Commons and the Senate of Northern Ireland. Son of Prime Minister John Miller Andrews, he was educated at Moure Grange Preparatory School, County Down, and Shrewsbury School. Andrews entered Parliament as MP for Mid Down in 1953 (replacing his father), a seat which he represented until his resignation in 1964, when he was elected to the Senate where he sat until the Parliament was prorogued in 1972. His election to the senate was following a cabinet reshuffle, in which Andrews accepted demotion to the politically unimportant position of Government Minister in the Senate. He held several Cabinet positions, including Minister in the Senate from 1964 and Deputy Prime Minister from May 1969. He was a contender for the position of Prime Minister on the retirement of Lord Brookeborough, but when it became clear that Terence O'Neill had a comfortable lead over both Andrews and Brian Faulkner in the parliamentary party, no contest was held. In 1969 he was approached by O'Neill to succeed him, but he refused and James Chichester-Clark was elected During the 1970 Bannside and South Antrim by-elections, Andrews was at the centre of the UUP's pluralist campaign against Ian Paisley's Protestant Unionist Party, declaring \"What does Protestant Unionism mean? Does it mean that you have to put a sign over the door of the Unionist Party saying Protestants only?\" Andrews was knighted in 1973. In retirement, he served as President of the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland."

  "text" : "Thomas Livingstone Learmonth (1818-1903) was an early Victorian settler who established land around Ballarat, Victoria. Learmonth was the son of Thomas Learmonth, a well-known settler in Tasmania, and was born in 1818. Having been attracted to the new settlement at Port Phillip, he started with a pioneering party from the shores of Corio Bay, in August 1837, to explore the unknown country to the north-west, directing their course, in the first instance, to Mount Buninyong, near to which, in conjunction with his brother, Somerville Livingstone Learmonth, Mr. T. L. Learmonth subsequently entered on pastoral pursuits on the fine country the party then discovered farther to the north-west. In the following year the two brothers and some friends explored the course of the Loddon, and reached a prominent peak, which they afterwards called Ercildoune, from an old keep on the Scottish border associated with their ancestral history. Here the brothers established a second station. After many years of prosperity the Messrs. Learmonth disposed of their Buninyong property, and subsequently sold the famous Ercildoune estate to Sir Samuel Wilson. Mr. Learmonth was for some time a member of the Upper House in Victoria, and finally left for England in 1868. Mr. Learmonth, later lived at Park Hall, Polmont, N.B., and was a J. P. for Stirlingshire, married, firstly, in 1857, Louisa, daughter of Major-General Sir Thomas Valiant, who died in 1878; and, secondly, in 1879, Jane Florence Harriett, daughter of Lestock Reid, of the Bombay Civil Service. He died in 1903."

On 6 October 2011, he staged a walkout and strike outside the Pakistani parliament in Islamabad while boycotting a session to protest the PPP-led government's apparent inability in curbing continuous sectarian attacks on Hazara people in Balochistan. Later, he was also joined in solidarity by members of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League (N). He held talks with Rehman Malik in which he demanded a solid plan to end sectarian killings in Quetta and also called for a complete dissolution of the Government of Balochistan which, according to him, had completely failed to maintain law and order in the province. His father Haji Syed Hussain Hazara was also a politician and leader."
