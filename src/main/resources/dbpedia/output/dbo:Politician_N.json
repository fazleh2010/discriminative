  "text" : "Norman Edward Fawcett (July 29, 1910 – January 26, 1997) was a Canadian politician, who represented the riding of Nickel Belt in the Canadian House of Commons from 1965 to 1968. He was a member of the New Democratic Party of Canada. He was born in Adanac, Saskatchewan. He later settled in Capreol, Ontario, where he worked as a railway conductor and a union activist before entering municipal politics, serving as a municipal councillor and deputy mayor beginning in 1962. Fawcett won a 1965 by-election brought on by the resignation of Osias Godin. He represented Nickel Belt for three years, and was defeated by Liberal candidate Gaetan Serré in the 1968 election. Following his defeat, he was re-elected to Capreol's town council as mayor in 1969, serving four years. After two years out of office, he was reelected to town council in 1975, serving as councillor and deputy mayor until his retirement from politics in 1991. Following his death in 1997, statements of tribute were delivered in the House of Commons by Raymond Bonin, John Williams, Elsie Wayne, Bill Blaikie and René Laurin. Fawcett's daughter is married to Elie Martel, who was the Member of Provincial Parliament for Sudbury East from 1967 to 1987. Shelley Martel, Elie Martel's daughter and Fawcett's granddaughter, won election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario upon Elie Martel's retirement, and continued to represent the riding of Nickel Belt until her own retirement from politics in 2007. She is married to former Ontario New Democratic Party leader Howard Hampton."

He was also the deputy mayor of Toronto, succeeding Doug Holyday in 2013 after the latter resigned from Council to contest a by-election for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Following the controversy surrounding Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's admitted substance abuse and further allegations of inappropriate conduct, the Toronto City Council voted on November 15, 2013 and November 18, 2013 to remove the non-statutory mayoral powers from Ford and grant them to Kelly for the remainder of Ford's term. On May 1, 2014, Kelly took over the remainder of Ford's duties when Ford entered drug rehabilitation and started a leave of absence from Toronto City Council. These powers were returned when Ford returned to his job on July 1. Even though Kelly had all the powers of the mayoral office for 3 months, Ford still technically held the title of Mayor, while Kelly was still referred to as the Deputy Mayor."

  "text" : "John Nicholas Udall usually called Nick Udall (July 23, 1913 – June 15, 2005) was mayor of Phoenix, Arizona from 1948–52. He was a member of the Udall political family and was also a nephew of Spencer W. Kimball, the 12th President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Udall was born and raised in Arizona. His parents John Hunt Udall and Ruth Kimball were in the same English literature class at the St. Joseph Stake Academy (now Eastern Arizona College), and when learning about playwright Nicholas Udall, they joked that if they ever got married, that they would name their son Nick, which they did. Udall attended Brigham Young University and the University of Arizona before enrolling in The George Washington University Law School, graduating in 1943. After graduation, he returned home to Arizona, where he began his law practice. He followed in his father's footsteps, and served as mayor of Phoenix from 1948 to 1952. He served with then-City Councilman Barry Goldwater. From 1952 to 1956 he served as judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court. Nick left the bench to return to private legal practice at Jennings, Strouss, Salmon & Trask in Phoenix, where he practiced law until retiring in 1992. A lifelong member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Nick served in various church positions, including service as a full-time missionary in the Eastern Central States mission from 1934 to 1936, as Bishop of the Phoenix Third Ward from 1970 to 1975 (\"the most satisfying calling that a worthy priesthood holder can have\" because \"he is continually helping people\"), and as Patriarch of the Phoenix Arizona Stake from 1975 to 1991. Nick and his wife, Sybil Elizabeth Webb, are the parents of seven children. They are buried alongside each other in Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary & Cemetery in Phoenix, Arizona. Following Sybil's death in 1998, Nick married Joan Romney in 2001. His autobiography, \"The Wonder of It All,\" was published by FCP Publishing in 2006."

Shakespeare was born in Staffordshire, England, arriving in Victoria, British Columbia in 1863. Shakespeare was involved in the photography business, running a gallery and acting as an agent for others. He made an early run for office as an independent candidate in the second British Columbia election in 1875, coming fourth in a two-member district. Shakespeare was a leader in the anti-Chinese movement in the city. He became president of the Workingmen’s Protective Association in 1878. The short-lived organization was established to lobby for restrictions on Chinese immigration during the 1878 election. Shakespeare’s politics were popular in the Victoria of his day. He was elected mayor in 1882. He was also elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament that year, defeating former B.C. Premier Amor De Cosmos in the Victoria district. Shakespeare was re-elected in 1887 but resigned his seat only three months later to become Postmaster for Victoria."

Spearing then returned to parliament a few weeks later after winning the Newham South by-election (caused by the constituency's MP, Elwyn Jones, being made a life peer in order to take on the role of Lord Chancellor) with a majority of 9,321. This was the only by-election held in the February–October 1974 Parliament. Spearing was then re-elected at the October 1974 general election, and held the Newham South seat until 1997, when he was deselected in favour of Jim Fitzpatrick.

He starting Basic Education school with help of Birla Trust in every village of Luharu- Jind state now district Bhiwani. Having served as a minister in the government of Jind, Takshak was involved in the wrangling that resulted from the formation in 1948 of the short-lived state known as the Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU). There were three organisations vying to hold the reins of power, being the Akali Dal, Lok Sewak Dal and the Praja Mandal. The latter suffered from internal rivalries and Takshak – along with Zail Singh, Seth Ram Nath and Harcharan Singh – were encouraged to split from it by forming the Pepsu Pradesh Congress Committee. They entered the government of Gian Singh Rarewala, which was sworn in on 13 January 1949. He became Education and Finance minister for the new state. Later, in 1953, he was among a group of MLAs who rebelled against the Indian National Congress government of Raghbir Singh, causing it to collapse and Rarewala once again to assume power. The Hindu has said that he was the first example of a politician changing allegiance in India. The action was later to stigmatise him. He founded Birhi teacher training school and Art craft teacher training in Arya Hindi Maha Vidyalaya Charkhi Dadri. A statue in his honour was unveiled at Bhagwi in 2007."

He served as the Speaker of the Madras Legislative Assembly from 1955 to 1956. Soon after the untimely death of his father (Ulanat Mootha Pannicker, a chieftain of the Zamorin of Calicut), Gopal’s mother with her six small children moved to Madras (the erstwhile Madras Presidency ). Gopal did his schooling and higher studies in the Madras Christian College High School and graduate studies at Madras Christian College and the Law College, Madras. After qualifying in Law he joined the Legal firm of Sir Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu who became his mentor. Sir KV Reddy, was the first Indian to be appointed Governor of a Presidency, when he became the Governor of the Madras Presidency in June 1936. Gopala Menon set up his private law practice in Madras in the early 1920s, getting a good start from the extensive practice of Sir Reddy, a part of which was turned over to him. Always a person who was sympathetic to the conditions of the under-privileged, Gopala Menon devoted his legal practice to the requirements of the needy. He virtually adopted a large cluster of poor households in Vepery and Choolai districts for whom he provided free legal service. He represented this Municipal constituency in the Madras Corporation for nearly twenty years from the early 1930s. During his Membership of the Madras Corporation he was for many terms the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance and other important Committees, and was elected the Deputy Mayor for a term. He was elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly in 1952, (see Madras Legislative Assembly election, 1952) from the Ponnani constituency in the South Malabar district of Madras Presidency . This was a landmark victory as in these elections, the Communist Party of India and the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party had made a strong showing and his was one of only 5 victories for the INC out of 31 constituencies in what later became Kerala state. In September 1955 he was elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Madras State (see List of Speakers of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly), the precursor of the present Tamil Nadu state. He was only the second person to occupy this office, following the first ever Speaker of the newly created Madras State J. Shivashanmugam Pillai who served from May 1952 to August 1955. He published a book on Parliamentary Practices, which served as a handbook for newly elected law makers, who were unfamiliar with the subject."

  "text" : "Norm Letnick (born 1957 or 1958) is a Canadian politician who was first elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the 2009 provincial election and re-elected in 2013. He was elected as a member of the BC Liberal Party in the riding of Kelowna-Lake Country. While his party formed a majority government in the 39th Parliament, Letnick was not initially included in the cabinet but was appointed to several committees, including the Select Standing Committee on Health where he was chair and tasked to report on the impacts of baby boomers and alternative strategies on the health care system. As a private member Letnick also introduced one piece of legislation, the Emergency Intervention Disclosure Act, which was adopted by government. This was the first time in six years that a private member was successful in introducing and getting legislation passed in the legislature. Prior to his election to the legislature, he was a business professor at the Okanagan School of Business. He graduated from Heriot-Watt University with a Master of Business Administration and achieved candidacy status toward a Doctorate in Health Economics with the University of British Columbia before setting the PhD aside to focus on his public duties as minister of agriculture. He served as a municipal councillor in the Town of Banff in the 1990s and in the City of Kelowna between 2005 and 2009."

  "text" : "Naomi Yamamoto (born 1960 or 1961) is a Canadian politician who was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the 2009 provincial election. She was elected as a member of the BC Liberal Party in the riding of North Vancouver-Lonsdale. Yamamoto's party formed a majority government in the 39th Parliament and Premier Gordon Campbell included her in his cabinet, between June 2009 and October 2010, as Minister of State for Intergovernmental Relations, and then as Minister of State for Building Code Renewal between October 2010 and March 2011. Following the 2011 BC Liberal leadership election, in which Yamamoto endorsed George Abbott, the new Premier, Christy Clark, promoted Yamamoto to Minister of Advanced Education. Yamamoto has introduced one piece of legislation, the Advanced Education Statutes Amendment Act, 2011, which sought to implement several measures, including expanding the Personal Education Number system which tracks students in the BC educational system to also include private educational institutions, specifying that board members of colleges and universities are to act in the best interests of the institution, and updating the Architectural Institute of BC's dispute resolution process. The bill was introduced on November 3, 2011, but was not adopted before the winter break. Prior to her election to the legislature, Yamamoto owned and operated a business that started as a specialty shop for laser printing but evolved to focus on design and had created props for the television and film industry. She spent time on the governing boards of Capilano College, the North Shore Credit Union, the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, and the Gordon and Marion Smith Foundation. She completed one term as president of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce and worked as the president and general manager of the North Vancouver Chamber of Commerce from 2007 until she was elected as MLA."

Murphy was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and received his VCE from Parade College in Bundoora. He later qualified for a Bachelor of Arts at La Trobe University. In 2000 he was National Welfare Officer for the National Union of Students as a member of the Australian Labor Students, and in 2001 became an electorate officer for federal Labor MP Lindsay Tanner, transferring to Senator Gavin Marshall in 2002. In 2004 he became a state organiser with the Victorian Labor Party, and in 2007 moved to the Plumbing Trades Employees Union as a community organiser, a position he held until his appointment to the Legislative Council in 2010. Murphy was involved in the controversial round of ALP preselections in 2006 in Victoria, where he challenged sitting member and future Speaker of the House Harry Jenkins for the safe Labor Division of Scullin. One journalist wrote that \"the choice of Murphy was so wrong-headed that even some of the Labor Unity people who negotiated the deal were embarrassed by it.\" In the lead up to the 2010 Victorian Election, Murphy held a $500 a head fundraiser at a Melbourne apartment. The event gained media attention when the apartment was subsequently found decrepit and soiled. Murphy lost his Legislative Council position at the election."

Nicholas was the eldest son of Henry, 2nd Viscount Barnewall, by Lady Mary Nugent, daughter of Richard Nugent, 2nd Earl of Westmeath. Before Nicholas was of age he married Mary Hamilton, daughter of George, Count Hamilton (son of Sir George Hamilton, 1st Baronet, of Donalong), by his wife, Frances Jennings (afterwards married to the Earl of Tyrconnel). They had three children: Henry, 4th Viscount Barnewall; George, father of the 5th Viscount; and Frances, who married her distant cousin Richard Barnewall and was the mother of the 14th Baron Trimlestown. In 1688 he entered King James's Irish army as captain in the Earl of Limerick's Dragoons. After the defeat of the Boyne he was moved to Limerick; and being in that city at the time of its surrender, was included in the articles and secured his estates. In the first Irish Parliament of William III he took the oath of allegiance, but upon declining to subscribe the declaration according to the English Act of 1689, as contrary to his conscience, he was obliged to withdraw with the other Catholic lords. In February 1703, he joined with many Irish Catholics in an unavailing petition against the infraction of the Treaty of Limerick. Lord Barnewall died 14 June 1725, and was buried at Lusk."

  "text" : "Nicolas Hyeronimus (1 January 1808 – 27 June 1860) was a pioneering innkeeper, merchant, pastoralist and politician in colonial New South Wales, Australia. Born in Wallonia, Hyeronimus arrived in New South Wales in about 1840. In 1842, he established the Lion of Waterloo, the first inn at Montefiores, near present-day Wellington, in the central west of New South Wales. He later built the first house in Wellington, and established the Carriers Arms, the first inn at the present site of Dubbo, New South Wales. In about 1854, Hyeronimus built the homestead The Meeting of the Waters (now named Glenrock), on land west of the Bell River near Wellington. By 1859, he was the proprietor of Goonoo (now Goonoo Goonoo), a pastoral run of 30,000 acres (120 km2) in Wellington County, and also three other pastoral runs totalling 61,480 acres (248.8 km2) in Bligh County. On 15 June 1859, Hyeronimus was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the inaugural member for the electoral district of Wellington. However, he died in Sydney in 1860, after serving only just over one year in office."

Nasarudin Hashim (born 20 July 1950) is a Malaysian politician. A member of the Perak State Legislative Assembly, he is known for his key role in the constitutional crisis in the state in 2009. His defection from the People's Justice Party (PKR) to the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO)—days after he had defected the other way—helped cause the collapse of the Pakatan Rakyat government of which PKR was a component party. Nasarudin was first elected to the assembly in 2004, as an UMNO member representing the seat of Parit. He was re-elected to the assembly in 2008, albeit for a different seat, Bota. In the 2008 election, the Pakatan Rakyat coalition took power in Perak, consigning Nasarudin's UMNO to opposition for the first time in the state's history. On 25 January 2009, Nasarudin announced his defection to PKR, thus boosting the Pakatan Rakyat's narrow majority in the assembly. He claimed it was a \"brave\" decision that had the support of his constituents. His move was followed by the defection of eight UMNO branches in his constituency. However, in early February, Nasarudin defected back to UMNO. Joined by three other Pakatan Rakyat MPs, the defection gave the UMNO-led Barisan Nasional coalition the numbers to return to government. Nasarudin said his reversal was to ensure the \"stability\" of government in Perak."

Black was born at Kilbridemore, Cowal, Argyleshire, Scotland, the son of Archibald Black (died 1808), a farmer, and his wife Janet, née Macchananaich (Buchanan). Black emigrated to Australia in 1839, and went to the Camperdown district, where, as the representative partner of Mr. Finlay, of Castle Toward, Argyleshire, Mr. Stuart Gladstone, of Capenock, and Mr. Stewart, of Glenormiston, Perthshire, Scotland, he purchased the Glenormiston property. The partnership, which was highly remunerative after 1846, continued until 1868, when the property was divided. Black bought Gladstone's portion, now known as Mount Noorat, and resided on it until his death on 15 May 1880. Black, who married Miss Grace Greenshiels Leadbetter, represented the Western Province from February 1859 to May 1880 in the Legislative Council, and was also a magistrate for the southern bailiwick. As a politician he was a staunch Conservative, and opposed the introduction of free education."

Whitney was born in Prince Edward County, Ontario, the son of David Henry Whitney and Ida May Wycott. Originally elected in the general election in 1951, he was re-elected in the general elections in 1955, 1959, 1963 and 1967, becoming the longest-serving MPP in that riding. During his four terms in office, Whitney was never appointed to Cabinet, but did sit on an average of ten Standing Committees during each term. Prior to being elected, Whitney was a sheep farmer in Prince Edward County. In 1980, Whitney died in a fire which destroyed his farm operation. In 1982, a new arch bridge constructed to connect the east end of Prince Edward County to Belleville (provincial Highway 62) was named the Norris Whitney Bridge, in tribute to his lengthy public service. Whitney is buried at the Albury Church Cemetery, Prince Edward County, Ontario."

  "text" : "Nancie Peacocke Fadeley (born July 11, 1930) is a former member of the Oregon House of Representatives, representing portions of Springfield and Eugene, in Lane County, Oregon, United States, from 1971 to January 1981. Elected in November 1970, she first took office in January 1971, holding one of five seats (Position 1) in House District 13 (mostly in Lane County). With the implementation in 1972 of a reapportionment plan that replaced all existing Oregon House districts with new single-member districts, Fadeley represented new District 42 starting with the 1973 legislative session. In 1971 and 1973, she chaired the House Environment and Land Use Committee. During her tenure as the chair, the committee oversaw the passage of Senate Bill 100, Oregon’s pioneering, statewide land-use planning legislation, as well as the Oregon Bottle Bill. The passage of SB 100 prompted the formation of 1000 Friends of Oregon, a watchdog organization committed to the defense of, and advocacy for, the state's land-use program. Later she became a charter member and a national board member of the Older Women's League (OWL), a grassroots organization that advocates for women as they age. After her service in the Oregon Legislative Assembly, Fadeley began a career at the University of Oregon, where she was assistant vice provost. Fadeley was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She was married to Edward Fadeley for about 30 years, ending in 1984. During the 1970s, the couple both served in theOregon Legislature — Nancie in the House and Ed in the Senate. The mother of two children, Fadeley is now a freelance journalist who writes about Oregon history, environmental issues, and concerns of older women."
