  "text" : "Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon PC SL KC (5 October 1732 – 4 April 1802) was a British politician and barrister, who served as Attorney General, Master of the Rolls and Lord Chief Justice. Born to a country gentleman, he was initially educated in Hanmer before moving to Ruthin School aged 12. Rather than going to university he instead worked as a clerk to an attorney, joining the Middle Temple in 1750 and being called to the Bar in 1756. Initially almost unemployed due to the lack of education and contacts which a university education would have provided, his business increased thanks to his friendships with John Dunning, who, overwhelmed with cases, allowed Kenyon to work many, and Lord Thurlow who secured for him the Chief Justiceship of Chester in 1780. He was returned as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hindon the same year, serving repeatedly as Attorney General under William Pitt the Younger. He effectively sacrificed his political career in 1784 to challenge the ballot of Charles James Fox, and was rewarded with a baronetcy; from then on he did not speak in the House of Commons, despite remaining an MP. On 27 March 1784 he was appointed Master of the Rolls, a job to which he dedicated himself once he ceased to act as an MP. He had previously practised in the Court of Chancery, and although unfamiliar with Roman law was highly efficient; Lord Eldon said \"I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than any of my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beat us all\". On 9 June 1788, Kenyon succeeded Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice, and was granted a barony. Although not rated as highly as his predecessor, his work \"restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law\". He remained Lord Chief Justice until his death in 1802."

Justus was born in Hendersonville and educated at Dana High School. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, he served in the United States Air Force, where he reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He was first appointed to the State Assembly in 1985 to fill the 50th District seat vacated by Charles Hughes' resignation. He served nine terms and was seeking re-election for a tenth (to the newly established 117th District) when he died in late October 2002. Because his name remained on the ballot and he received a majority of votes cast, the local Republican party named his widow, Carolyn K. Justus, to fill his seat. The western campus of the North Carolina Justice Academy was named the Larry T. Justus Western Justice Academy in his honor in 2004."

  "text" : "Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Edward Cavendish (28 January 1838 – 18 May 1891) was a 19th-century British politician. Born in Marylebone, Cavendish was the third son of William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, by his wife, Lady Blanche Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (a daughter of the 6th Earl of Carlisle and a niece of the 6th Duke of Devonshire). His father and his two surviving brothers were all Members of Parliament (MPs): his eldest brother Spencer, MP for North Lancashire 1857–91 and later 8th Duke of Devonshire, led the Liberal Party and was asked three times to be Prime Minister by Queen Victoria; the middle brother, Frederick was MP for the West Riding and Chief Secretary for Ireland and was assassinated in 1882. Cavendish was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade. On retirement from the regular army he joined the 2nd Derbyshire Militia (later the Sherwood Foresters), but transferred to the King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment in 1888. Cavendish served as MP for West Derbyshire from the creation of the constituency until his death. Like his eldest brother, he became a Liberal Unionist in reaction to the Liberal Party's policy on Irish Home Rule. Upon his death in Marylebone aged 53, his son, Victor, was elected unopposed to replace him, later becoming the 9th Duke of Devonshire. Cavendish married his cousin Emma Lascelles, a daughter of the Rt. Hon. William Lascelles, on 3 August 1865. They had three sons:"

Mayencourt was first elected in the 2001 provincial election, defeating New Democrat opponent Tim Stevenson. He was previously the founder and, for its first five years, executive director of the Vancouver Friends for Life Society, which supports people living with AIDS, cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. He is the founder of the BC New Hope Recovery Society and Baldy Hughes Therapeutic Community in North Central BC which supports addicts in a long-term recovery community. In the 2005 election, conflicting results throughout the night had both Mayencourt and Stevenson declared the victor in Vancouver-Burrard, and the uncertainty continued for several weeks. In the final count of regular ballots, Stevenson was declared the winner by 17 votes; however, when absentee ballots were counted on May 30, Mayencourt was declared the winner by a margin of 18 votes. After a judicial recount, Mayencourt was declared the victor by 11 votes. He is known for his Private Member's Bill called the Safe Streets Act (2004), which aimed to deter aggressive panhandling. He chaired the provincial Safe Schools Task Force (2003) and introduced the Safe Schools Act (2005) to combat bullying in the school system based on racism, sexism and homophobia. He introduced the Apology Act to facilitate sincere and timely reconciliation between government, business and citizens. Mayencourt announced that he would not run in the 2009 provincial election, and resigned early to run as the Conservative Party of Canada's candidate in Vancouver Centre for the 2008 general election. He lost to incumbent Liberal MP Hedy Fry. Mayencourt announced that he would seek the BC Liberal Party nomination in the riding of Vancouver-False Creek for the British Columbia general election, 2013 after the current incumbent Mary McNeil announced she would not be seeking another term. His main competition is Sam Sullivan. Mayencourt currently lives in Vancouver, B.C."

Born and raised in Arizona, he was the son of David King Udall, a politician, and Eliza Stewart Udall, the first telegraph operator in the Arizona Territory. He was named after his grandfather, Levi Stewart. He was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 1914 he married Louisa Lee, a granddaughter of John D. Lee and Jacob Hamblin. They would later have six children. He passed the Arizona Bar exam in 1922, and was admitted to the bar, without having earned a law degree (a common practice in those days). Later that year he succeeded his father as stake president of the St. Johns Stake, a position he held until 1945. In 1922, he lost a bid to be elected as clerk to the Arizona Superior Court. He was defeated by his older brother John Hunt Udall. In 1946 he was elected to the Arizona Supreme Court, and remained a Justice of that court from 1947 until his death. In 1948 Udall wrote the majority opinion of the Arizona State Supreme Court granting Native Americans living on reservations the right to vote. From 1951-1952 and 1957-1958 he served as the Chief Justice of that court. In 1960 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Arizona. He died on May 30 of that year."

  "text" : "Lord Arthur John Edward Russell (14 June 1825 – 4 April 1892) was a British Liberal Party politician. He was born in London on 14 June 1825, the second of three sons of Major-General Lord George William Russell and Elizabeth Anne Rawdon, daughter of the Hon. John Theophilus Rawdon, himself second son of the 1st Earl of Moira. His elder brother was Francis, later 9th Duke of Bedford and his younger brother was Odo, later 1st Baron Ampthill. He was educated in Germany and from 1849 to 1854 he was private Secretary to his uncle, the Liberal Prime Minister Lord John Russell. Between 1857 and 1885, he sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tavistock. He only spoke rarely in the Commons, once in reply to an attack on his brother Odo. On 25 September 1865, Russell married Laura de Peyronnet, daughter of Paul Louis Jules, Vicomte de Peyronnet. They had six children, Harold Russell, Flora Russell, the diplomat Sir Claud Russell, Caroline Russell, Major Gilbert Russell and Conrad Russell. He was raised to the rank of a Duke's son on 25 June 1872 and was then known as Lord Arthur Russell. He was a great clubman and belonged to Brooks's, the Athenaeum, the Cosmopolitan, Grillion's, THE CLUB, and the Metaphysical Society. He was involved in the Senate of the University of London, serving on this body from 1875 to his death. Russell died on 4 April 1892 at 2 Audley Square, London, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. There is a memorial to him in the 'Bedford Chapel' at St. Michael’s Church, Chenies. The ideological gulf between Britain and the new German Empire was stressed by Lord Russell in 1872: Prussia now represents all that is most antagonistic to the liberal and democratic ideas of the age; military despotism, the rule of the sword, contempt for sentimental talk, indifference to human suffering, imprisonment of independent opinion, transfer by force of unwilling populations to a hateful yoke, disregard of European opinion, total want of greatness and generosity, etc., etc.\""

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Northwest Territories in 1995 and served until Nunavut was created in 1999. Barnabas served as the first Speaker in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut. In 1999 he was elected to the 1st Legislative Assembly of Nunavut but had to resign in August 2000 after being convicted of sexual assault. The conviction came at the same time as James Arvaluk was charged with assault against his girl friend. He pleaded guilty and resigned. The two scandals rocked the new government, and caused a substantial drop in positive public opinion. The resignation led to the first by-election in Nunavut history. Barnabas ran in the December 2000 by-election but was defeated by Rebekah Williams. He ran again in the 2004 Nunavut election in a hotly contested race and defeated Williams by doubling her vote count."

In an e-mail message dated January 21, 2009, Taparadjuk wrote: \"Often, in cases of domestic disputes, both parties share the blame, but according to the criminal code, the person who gets physical is charged, even though the other party may have initiated the conflict. Often the male is charged even though the conflict may have been initiated by the female partner.\" Three days after Taparadjuk's e-mail was sent, Premier Eva Aariak removed him as Minister of Justice, saying, \"This government does not condone violence against women or men in any way, for any reason, which the line seems to imply.\" Source: 1 and 2"

Landreville, a native of Ottawa, practiced law in Sudbury in the 1940s and 1950s before becoming the city's mayor. During his mayoral term, he was offered an option on 10,000 shares of stock in Northern Ontario Natural Gas, a company run by Ralph K. Farris that was seeking a municipal agreement on the construction of a natural gas pipeline through Northern Ontario. When the NONG contract was approved by city council, Farris purchased the shares at the original price offered to Landreville, sold 2,500 shares to reimburse the company, and delivered the 7,500 remaining shares to Landreville at no cost. Following his appointment to the Supreme Court, Landreville sold the shares for a profit of $117,000. After an Ontario Securities Commission investigation into NONG's stock distributions, it was ultimately revealed that many of Northern Ontario's mayors, as well as some members of Premier Leslie Frost's cabinet, had received low-cost shares. After a second investigation, Landreville was charged with municipal corruption and conspiracy, and was acquitted as there was no evidence that he had exerted any influence on Sudbury's city council to approve the NONG contract. In response, however, the Law Society of Upper Canada held a secret hearing in which it determined that despite the acquittal, Landreville's conduct had fallen below the \"standards of probity\" demanded of a judge, and called for his resignation. In 1966, Prime Minister Lester Pearson appointed a Royal Commission, chaired by Ivan Rand, to investigate the case. Controversially, the Law Society report was admitted into the proceedings, but the original judgement acquitting Landreville of misconduct was not. Landreville was also never given an opportunity, as required under law, to respond to the royal commission's report. Landreville initially refused to resign from the bench, leading Pearson's government to announce, on June 6, 1967, an unusual joint address of the House of Commons and the Senate to have him removed from the bench. He was then convinced to resign voluntarily with the promise of a partial pension. Pierre Trudeau, then Justice Minister, later wrote to advise Landreville that the federal cabinet had decided not to offer Landreville the pension, although subsequent Access to Information requests revealed that the cabinet had made no such decision. Landreville waged a ten-year legal battle to have the pension offer honoured, and was finally offered $250,000. Landreville subsequently returned to practicing law."

At the 1931 general election, Mallalieu was elected as the Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Colne Valley. His win was notable as it was a gain from Labour despite the presence of a Conservative candidate, unusual for 1931. His predecessor was the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden, who had decided to stand down. His father Frederick Mallalieu had been MP for the same seat from 1916 to 1922. Mallalieu was a member of the main Liberal group in parliament led by Sir Herbert Samuel. He followed his leader into opposition in 1933. He served until the 1935 general election, when he lost his seat to Labour's Ernest Marklew. After joining the Labour Party, he returned to the House of Commons in 1948, at a by-election on 24 March in the Brigg constituency, where he served as MP until he retired in 1974. He was a Deputy Speaker of the Commons from 1971 to 1974."

  "text" : "Lyle Dean MacWilliam (born 31 July 1949) was a member of the Canadian House of Commons from 1988 to 1993. His background included martial arts instruction, plus market research and its related education. Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, the son of John Michael MacWilliam and Doris Louise Coghill, MacWilliam studied at Simon Fraser University. In 1971, he married Arlene Leslie Sundvick. MacWilliam ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1983. He was elected to represent Okanagan North in the assembly as a New Democratic Party member in a 1984 by-election held following the death of Donald James Campbell, but he was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1986. He entered federal politics after winning the 1988 federal election at the Okanagan—Shuswap electoral district for the New Democratic Party. He served in the 34th Canadian Parliament but lost to Darrel Stinson of the Reform Party in the 1993 federal election. He then joined the Liberal Party under which he campaigned at Okanagan—Shuswap in the 1997 federal election. He was again defeated by Stinson, placing second."

Under the federal constitution of the Liberal Democrats the leader is required to be a member of the House of Commons. Before the election of the first federal leader of the party (the Liberal Democrats having a federal structure in their internal party organisation), the leaders of the two parties which merged to form the Liberal Democrats, the Liberal Party and the SDP, served as joint interim leaders. In the event that the leader dies, resigns or loses his or her seat in Parliament, the deputy leader serves as interim leader until a leadership election takes place. This has occurred twice, with Menzies Campbell serving as interim leader following the resignation of Charles Kennedy (Campbell was elected leader in the ensuing election) and Vince Cable serving as interim leader following Campbell's resignation."

As majority leader, he was chair of the Senate Rules Committee and its subcommittees, and also served on the Senate Tax Committee. Pogemiller was born in Minneapolis and graduated from DeLaSalle High School in 1969. He was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1980, serving as the representative of District 55A from 1981 to 1983. After serving one term, he was elected to the Senate in 1982, serving the old District 58 prior to the 1992 redistricting and, thereafter, District 59. He was re-elected in every general election. He was appointed Director of the Higher Education office in October 2011 by Governor of Minnesota Mark Dayton. Pogemiller is known for his outspoken, assertive leadership style and his strategic thinking. Reporter Tom Scheck of Minnesota Public Radio called him \"a brilliant and combative political tactician who often speaks his mind\". Former Minnesota House Speaker Steve Sviggum called him \"a very frustrating individual as he runs the clock past midnight all the time.\" Pogemiller had a rocky relationship with former Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty."

Campbell (born July 31, 1931) a Republican politician from the U.S. state of Oregon, served as Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives in the early 1990s, representing Eugene. Larry Campbell began his career in the army and was honorably discharged as a Sergeant First Class. Campbell served as the Republic leader from 1982-1990. Campbell is credited with engineering his party's 1990 takeover of the state legislature, which lasted 16 years. He began working as a lobbyist in 1995, immediately after the end of his legislative term. He was criticized for pre-filing a bill that benefitted a client, with whom he had signed a contract while still a legislator. In 1999, he was considered the most powerful man in Salem. He started the Oregon Victory PAC, which quickly became the biggest lobbying group in the state outside the major parties; it contributed over $750,000 to Oregon politicians in the 1990s. He drew criticism for campaigning on behalf of Republican control of the legislature during the 2007 legislative session."

Lucy Middleton was an active member of Wimbledon Labour Party when the idea of publishing a book on the contribution of women to the labour movement was put forward as a way to celebrate International Women's Year. The Labour Party agreed to publish the book, and Lucy Middleton edited the essays of the 9 younger women she had invited to contribute. When finished the Labour Party General Secretary decided there was no money to publish the book, but Croom Helm agreed to publish it as \"Women in the Labour Movement, the British experience\" in 1977."

When the First Dáil established a separatist Irish Republic in 1919, the younger Robbins worked in the Dáil government's Department of Finance. He was nominated as a Sinn Féin candidate in the Longford–Westmeath constituency in the 1921 general election. Arthur Griffith suggested that, if elected, he be excused attendance at the Dáil in order to continue working for the Department of Finance; Michael Collins overruled Griffith. Robbins and the other Sinn Féin candidates were returned unopposed as TDs to the Second Dáil. On 7 January 1922, he voted in favour of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. On 11 January he was appointed Assistant Minister for Local Government in the post-Treaty Dáil government, although this appointment was never ratified by the Dáil. He lost his Dáil seat at the 1922 general election, although he remained an Assistant Minister until the Dáil government was merged with the Provisional Government in September."

He was re-elected in 2004 and served as Deputy Mayor of the Halifax Regional Municipality. He entered provincial politics in the 2006 election, defeating Liberal leader Francis MacKenzie in the Bedford riding. In June 2006, Goucher was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Tourism, Culture and Heritage. In October 2007, Goucher was shuffled to Minister of Immigration. In January 2009, Goucher was given two additional roles in cabinet, becoming Minister of the Public Service Commission, and Minister of Seniors. In the 2009 election, Goucher was defeated by Liberal Kelly Regan. In February 2010, he became embroiled in a spending scandal involving inappropriate expenses charged to the public by a number of Nova Scotia MLAs. Goucher was singled out by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation when they highlighted Nova Scotian politicians for their \"outrageous\" expense claims, naming him the all-star of the scandal and giving him the nickname Len \"the master of multi-tasking\" Goucher. On February 14, 2011 the RCMP released its long awaited investigation results and Goucher was cleared of any wrongdoing."

Since 2005, Simms has been chairman and chief executive officer of the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation, a provincial crown corporation. He served as Speaker of the House of Assembly from 1979 to 1982 when he was appointed to the provincial cabinet of Premier Brian Peckford. Simms served in the portfolios of Culture, Recreation and Youth, Forest Resources and Lands, President of Treasury Board and President of Executive Council. Simms ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1989 but lost to Tom Rideout who subsequently appointed him Development Minister in his Cabinet. The Tory government was defeated in the 1989 general election and Simms moved to the Opposition benches. He succeeded Rideout in 1991 to become Leader of the Opposition and party leader. The party lost the 1993 general election and Simms resigned as party leader two years later. He was appointed head of the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation by Premier Danny Williams in 2005. In 2007 he stepped down in order to take a senior role in Williams' 2007 re-election campaign and was immediately re-appointed to the $130,000 a year housing corporation position following the election leading to complaints of \"blatant patronage\" from the Opposition."

He was also House Speaker from 1963–1971 and Minority Leader from 1959–1963. Duxbury was first elected to the House in 1950 at a time when candidates, representatives and leadership positions were officially non-partisan. He allied with the House's Conservative Caucus, and was known to be a Republican. He was re-elected nine times. When the Conservative Caucus gained a majority in 1963, he became Speaker by one vote over Aubrey Dirlam, and held the position until his retirement from the House in 1971, when he was succeeded by Dirlam. Duxbury was offered the position of United States Attorney for Minnesota by President Richard Nixon in 1969, but declined. After leaving the Legislature, he became a lobbyist for and vice president of Burlington Northern Railroad. Duxbury died in 2002."

  "text" : "Alexander James Douglas \"Lex\" Bell OAM (born 13 July 1945) is an Australian politician. Born in Brisbane, he received a Master of Laws from Bond University and a Bachelor of Law from the University of Queensland before becoming a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Queensland. He was also on Gold Coast City Council from 1985–2001, including a period as mayor 1988–1994. He was also a chancellor with the Anglican Catholic Church. On 20 March 2001, former National Party Premier and member for Surfers Paradise Rob Borbidge resigned from the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. Bell contested the resulting by-election as an independent. Due to voter anger at going back to the polls for the second time in three months, the National vote collapsed to eight percent, and Bell was elected with 58 percent of the two-candidate preferred vote. He held the seat until the 2004 state election, when he finished third on the primary vote, allowing his Liberal challenger in 2001, John-Paul Langbroek, to win the seat.Mr Bell announced in late 2011 he would contest his former council seat of Division 7 in Surfers Paradise which he regained on 28 April 2012."

She is a member of the Yukon New Democratic Party. She was born in Oshawa, Ontario, and grew up in Whitby, Ontario. She studied history at Trent University in Peterborough where she completed a bachelor's decree before moving to the Yukon. Prior to becoming a politician, Moorcroft served as a librarian at Yukon College's Whitehorse campus. She also served on the Yukon Employment Standards Board, the Yukon Electoral District Boundaries Commission and has held positions on the boards of the Yukon College Employees Union and the Yukon Federation of Labour. In the 1992 Yukon election, Moorcroft was successful in her attempt to enter politics in the seat of Mount Lorne. A strong feminist activist, her campaign platform was built on pay equality for women and fighting against violations of the Canadian Human Rights Act. After a term in government, Moorcroft sought reelection in the 1996 Yukon election, gaining 33.2% of the votes, compared with Liberal Party candidate Ken Taylor, with 20.5%. During her second term, Moorcroft managed to obtain the positions of Minister for Justice, Education and the Women's Directorate. In the 2000 Yukon provincial election, Moorcroft again contested the seat of Mount Lorne but lost it to Liberal Party candidate Cynthia Tucker, 36% to 27%. Tucker served for one term in Mount Lorne until she was replaced in 2002 by Steve Cardiff. She continues to advocate for women and First Nations rights. In April 2006 Moorcroft was appointed to the Yukon Human Rights Commission. In June 2011 she announced that she was running as the NDP candidate in the Copperbelt South riding in the 2011 election. She won on election night by a margin of just three votes over Yukon Party candidate Valerie Boxall; her victory was confirmed in a recount."

He was defeated in his quest for a third term on November 6, 1917, and returned to his meat packing business. In 1917, he was elected president of the Buffalo Baseball and Amusement Company and, in 1922, appointed a member of the Buffalo Board of Education.

Born in Hubbards, Nova Scotia, he moved west during one of the British Columbia gold rushes where he and his brother, Walter Tyrrel Shatford, ran a general store in the gold mining town of Fairview near what is now Oliver. They also owned the Shatford Mercantile Store in Hedley which was one of the town's first permanent structures. In 1905, the brothers established the Southern Okanagan Land Company. They proceeded to purchase and subdivide land north of the Canada/US border and installed in irrigation system in the area of Vaseux Lake. In 1918, they sold 22,000 acres (89 km2) to the government of British Columbia for $300,000 in order to settle demobilized Canadian soldiers following World War I. Shatford was elected to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly in the 1903 provincial election as a Conservative representing the riding of Similkameen. He remained in the legislature until 1917 when he was appointed to the Canadian Senate by Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden. He died in office in 1920. He was the second president of the BC and Yukon Chamber of Mines, founded in 1912. The first president was Robert Hedley. Shatford was elected at the organization's first annual general meeting in 1913. The Shatford School, now part of Penticton Secondary School in Penticton, British Columbia was named in his honour."

He then represented the Avon electorate from 1884 to 1887, when he again resigned. He bought Ilam homestead, once the largest residential building in Christchurch, and was for some years co-owner of Risingholme, which was bought from the estate of William Reeves. Harper left New Zealand in July 1891. It only emerged later that his law firm was bankrupt, and that NZ£200,000 had been embezzled. He later lived on Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, where he died in 1915. Arthur Paul Harper was his son."

  "text" : "Alan Robert Lindsay \"Lin\" Gordon (19 January 1917 – 16 June 2011) was an Australian politician. He was the Labor member for Murrumbidgee in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1970 to 1984. He was Minister for Conservation and Water Resources from 1976 to 1981 (with Conservation replaced by Lands and Forests in 1980), Minister for Local Government and Lands from 1981 to 1984, and Minister for Lands and Ports for a few months in 1984. Gordon was born in Cessnock to baker David Irvine Gordon and Mary Mildred Cleary. He was educated at government schools in Cessnock and after graduating was apprenticed to a pharmacy. He attended the University of Sydney, graduating in 1945. On 6 November 1943 he married Valerie Merle Webber, with whom he had five children. He subsequently owned a pharmacy, and also a trotting stud near Leeton. A Roman Catholic, he joined the Australian Labor Party in 1962. In 1965, he was elected to Leeton Shire Council, where he served until 1970 (including a year as President, 1969–1970). When Al Grassby, Labor member for Murrumbidgee, resigned in 1969 to contest the federal seat of Riverina, Gordon was selected as the Labor candidate for the resulting by-election, which took place early in 1970. He easily defeated his Liberal and Country Party opponents. In 1976, he was appointed to the ministry, holding the Conservation and Water Resources portfolios. He briefly served as Acting Minister for Health in 1977, for Local Government in 1978 and for Corrective Services in 1979. In 1980 the Conservation portfolio was split into Lands and Forests, both of which were retained by Gordon. In 1981 his Forests and Water Resources portfolios were exchanged for Local Government, which in turn was exchanged for Ports in 1984. Gordon retired in 1984; his seat was won by National Party candidate Adrian Cruickshank in his absence. Gordon died at his Wagga Wagga home on 16 June 2011."

He was a J.P. and Deputy Lieutenant for Cardiganshire. At the 1880 general election Pugh was elected Member of Parliament for Cardiganshire. He held the seat until 1885. Pugh had a distinguished career as a lawyer in India, becoming Attorney General of Bengal. In 1905, he had the house built at Cymerau. He died at the age of 70. Pugh married Veronica Harriet Hills, daughter of James Hills of Neechindepore, Bengal in 1864. Veronica was the sister of James Hills who won the Victoria Cross in the Indian Mutiny. Family history says her younger brother Charles Hills (1847-1935) was the real father of Hollywood actress Merle Oberon (see Mile MacNair's book)."

One of his notable accomplishments was the invention and widespread use of \"single wire earth-return\" (SWER) grids for rural electrification in New Zealand. This form of grid uses only a single wire, and made rural electrification dramatically more affordable and commonplace. It improves the standard of living of rural families. SWER is now used in many countries, including Australia, Canada, Brazil and some parts of the United States. In New Zealand, SWER is sometimes called \"Mandeno's clothesline.\" In a history of WEL Networks, Mandeno, who was Chief Electrical Engineer at Frankton Power Station from 1913 to 1916, was described as having a distinguished career designing and building hydro power stations. In the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours, Mandeno was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to engineering."

As part of an investigation into fraudulent use of communications allowances by Progressive Conservative members of the Saskatchewan legislature, Kopelchuk was charged with using a false expense claim to pay $1,568 for an electronic public address system. This expense could have legitimately been claimed against his constituency office allowance. In addition, the actual cost of the system was $1,005; the balance went to John Scraba, communications director for the Saskatchewan Progressive Conservative party. The judge acquitted him, deciding that there was no evidence that Kopelchuk was aware of the misleading invoice. As of 2010, Kopelchuk was living in Canora."

He served in the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Labour and Minister of Fisheries. He was Minister of Labour at the time of the Westray Mine disaster. His department was responsible for safety at the mine, and Legere faced criticism over his handling of the disaster. He was removed as Minister of Labour in November 1992, but kept the fisheries portfolio. In the 1993 election, he was defeated by Liberal Richie Hubbard. Following his defeat, he returned to the education field, and served as one of the two directors of schools for the SouthwestRegional School Board. In June 2000, the Government of Nova Scotia divided the Southwest Regional School Board into two district boards, and Legere was named the chief executive officer for both the new Tri-County District School Board and the new South Shore District School Board. He also served as Regional Education Officer for the Nova Scotia Department of Education. In April 2013, Legere was appointed to the federal government's Social Security Tribunal, which handles all EI, Social Security and Canada Pension Plan appeals."
