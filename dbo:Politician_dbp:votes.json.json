  "text" : "Jack C. Voight (born December 17, 1945) is a Wisconsin insurance agent and a former State Treasurer of Wisconsin. He is a member of the Republican Party. Born and raised in New London, Wisconsin, Voight received his Bachelor of Science from the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh in 1971. After serving as an Army sergeant from 1968–70, he moved to Appleton, Wisconsin, where he established an insurance agency. Voight served on the Appleton City Council from 1983–1993, holding the position of council president from 1992 - 1993. When incumbent Treasurer Cathy Zeuske ran in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in 1994, Voight ran as the Republican nominee to replace her. He was elected that year, and re-elected in 1998 and 2002. He was defeated for re-election on November 7, 2006, by Democrat Dawn Marie Sass, a former parole officer and AFSCME union activist, now working as a clerk at the department store Boston Store, in what was considered an upset. Voight had defeated Sass in both 1998 and 2002, and Sass said she spent less than $4000 on the race, most out of her own pocket. Voight held the position of president of the National Association of State Treasurers in 1997. In May 2009, Voight announced his interest in seeking the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin in 2010, but instead, the following June Voight announced he was going to run to replace retiring Outagamie County Executive Toby Paltzer. On April 5, 2011, he was defeated by former Assemblyman and unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor Tom Nelson, by roughly 52% - 48%. Voight blamed the political unrest stemming from Governor Scott Walker's policy drive to eliminate public workers' collective bargaining powers, saying \"The labor movement has not only energized the Democratic Party base but a lot of the independents.\""

Mallet was returned to Parliament for Plymouth in 1906. In 1908 he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Walter Runciman who was President of the Board of Education. In February 1910 Asquith was considering him as a possible Chief Whip but was dissuaded by the outgoing Chief Whip Jack Pease who felt he was out of sympathy with many leading Liberals over the Lords. In March 1910 Prime Minister H. H. Asquith appointed him Financial Secretary to the War Office, a position he held until he was defeated in the December general election of the same year. He sought a return to parliament at the Salford North by-election, 1917 as a Coalition Liberal candidate but was defeated by an Independent Labour candidate. He did not contest the 1918 General Election. He was Honorary Secretary of the Free Trade Union. He became a supporter of the official Liberal party that opposed the Coalition Government. He sought to make a return to parliament standing as Liberal candidate for South Aberdeen, in 1922 without success. He tried again in 1923 without success. He had published two works on Liberal politicians; Mr Lloyd George, a Study (1930) and Herbert Gladstone, a Memoir (1932). His book on Lloyd George was entirely devoted to the shortcomings of the Liberal Leader."

Having been selected as the Liberal Party candidate, he received the \"coalition coupon\" and there was no Unionist Party candidate opposing him. He won the seat with a majority of 8% of the votes over his Labour Party opponent. However, for the 1922 election, when he stood as a National Liberal, the local Liberal association has not only decided to run an anti-coalition candidate against him but had attracted former Liberal cabinet minister, Charles Masterman as their candidate. Masterman polled nearly twice as many votes as Broad. With the Liberal vote split, the Labour candidate was able to take the seat. At the 1923 general election, with the two factions of the Liberal Party reunited, Broad stood in the Leyton East, but came third with only 28% of the votes. He did not stand for Parliament again."

Samuel was the elder brother of Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel. He attended the Liverpool Institute and University College School, Hampstead, London. He served as Justice of the Peace for the county of London. In 1889 he stood as a candidate for the newly formed London County Council for the Progressive Party, the municipal wing of the Liberal Party. He contested Whitechapel, and was elected with 1,523 votes, along with his running mate, Charles Tarling, who polled 1,477 votes. He served for one term, before standing down in 1892. Samuel was selected as Liberal candidate for Whitechapel in 1900, in succession to his uncle Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling, who had been the MP. He knew the constituency well, having represented it on the LCC. He held the seat for the Liberals with an increased majority. When the Liberal Party won the 1906 election with a landslide, he was again returned at Whitechapel. The Liberal Party faced the elections in 1910 against a resurgent Conservative Party. Despite this challenge, Samuel was re-elected with an increased majority, at both 1910 elections. Over the course of four general election campaigns in Whitechapel, Samuel had increased the Liberal share of the vote each time, taking it from 50.4% to 59.2%, changing the constituency from a marginal to a safe seat. In 1912 he was created Sir Stuart Samuel, Baronet of Chelwood Vetchery. In April 1913 he undertook a contract for the Government, which required him to resign his seat and face re-election at a by-election. His Conservative opponent from 1910 ran against him in the by-election. He was re-elected with a reduced majority. Samuel retired from politics in 1916."

He was defeated at the January 1910 general election; He was unsuccessful when he stood again in December 1910. Boulton did not stand again until the 1923 general election, when he fought the Conservative-held New Forest and Christchurch division of Hampshire. The seat had not been contested in either 1918 or 1922, and in a straight contest with the sitting Conservative MP, Boulton won 46% of the votes. Boulton stood again at the 1924 general election, when a Labour candidate also contested the seat. The Conservative vote increased, and Boulton's second-placed vote was less than half the Tory total. He did not stand for Parliament again."
