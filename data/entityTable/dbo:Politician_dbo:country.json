  "text" : "Albert Arthur Purcell (3 November 1872 – 24 December 1935) was a British trade unionist and Labour Party politician. He was President of the International Federation of Trade Unions from 1924 to 1928, and sat in the House of Commons in two separate periods between 1923 and 1929. Purcell joined a forerunner of the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association in 1891. About the same time, he also joined the Social Democratic Federation. He was elected to Salford Borough Council, serving for six years, then in 1911 became Assistant General Secretary of the union, followed in 1917 by election as General Secretary. Alongside this, he served as Treasurer of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades for three years, then as President. He was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in 1921, becoming President of the TUC in 1924. In 1925, he chaired a TUC delegation to the Soviet Union. Purcell was elected at the December 1923 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the city of Coventry, defeating the sitting Conservative MP Sir Edward Manville. However, at the next general election, in October 1924, he was defeated by the Conservative candidate from the 1923 general election. However, Purcell was out of Parliament for only 9 months. James Wignall, the Labour MP for the Forest of Dean division of Gloucestershire, died in June 1925, and at the resulting by-election on 14 July, Purcell won the seat. He did not defend that seat at the 1929 general election, but stood instead in Manchester Moss Side, where he was defeated by the sitting Conservative MP Sir Gerald Berkeley Hurst."

  "text" : "Albert Ernest Stubbs (1877–4 January 1962) was an English trade union official and politician. Stubbs was born in Yorkshire, but moved to Cambridge in March 1914. By trade he was a printing machinist, although he took a great interest in the plight of agricultural workers. In 1919 he became full-time District Officer of the Workers' Union for Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely, largely representing agricultural workers. When the Workers' Union amalgamated with the Transport and General Workers' Union in 1929 he became Cambridge and District Officer for the TGWU. A member of Cambridgeshire County Council from 1931 to his death and Cambridge Borough Council from 1923 to 1949 (and an alderman of both from 1942), he served as Labour Member of Parliament for Cambridgeshire from 1945 to 1950, when he lost his seat to the Conservatives (he had lost the general election for Cambridge in 1922 by only 679 votes). He is the only Labour MP to have ever sat for a Cambridgeshire constituency outside the city of Cambridge itself (although  Peterborough, which was during his lifetime outside the county, has been represented by Labour MPs). He retired from the TGWU in 1944."

  "text" : "Abel Buckley (1835 – 23 December 1908) was a British cotton manufacturer and Liberal politician of Irish descent. He was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, the younger son of Abel Buckley and Mary Keehan of Alderdale Lodge. He was educated at Mill Hill School and Owen's College. In 1875 he married Hannah Summers (who died in 1897) and they had one son, also Abel, born in 1876. The Buckley family owned two cotton mills in Ashton: Ryecroft and Oxford Road, and Abel became involved in the business. At his death he was described as \"one of the old cotton lords of Lancashire\". In 1885 Buckley inherited Ryecroft Hall, Audenshaw, from his uncle, James Smith Buckley, and was to live there for the rest of his life. He subsequently inherited Galtee Castle, near Mitchelstown, County Cork. The estate had been purchased by his uncle, Nathaniel Buckley, MP for Stalybridge in 1873. In 1885 Abel Buckley was elected Liberal MP for the newly created Prestwich constituency. In the general election of the following year, however, he was defeated. Apart from his interests in the cotton industry, Buckley was a director and chairman of the Manchester and Liverpool District Banking Company and a justice of the peace. He was a collector of fine art, and a racehorse breeder. He died at Ryecroft Hall on 23 December 1908, aged 73."

From 1917 to 1927 he was a member of the War Pensions Appeal Tribunal. He made his home at Stockport, Cheshire, where he was president of the local Trades Council and Labour Party, as well serving as a magistrate. He stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party at Wakefield at the 1918 and 1922 general elections. He eventually entered the Commons when he was elected member of parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne at a by-election in October 1928, after the sitting Conservative MP Cornelius Homan was disqualified when he was declared bankrupt. Bellamy was re-elected at the 1929 general election. Following the election, the Second Labour Government was formed, and he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to F O Roberts, Minister of Pensions. Soon after entering government, Bellamy became ill and died, at Wandsworth, in March 1931, aged 60. The by-election for his seat was won by the Conservative candidate John Broadbent."

He was defeated at the January 1910 general election; He was unsuccessful when he stood again in December 1910. Boulton did not stand again until the 1923 general election, when he fought the Conservative-held New Forest and Christchurch division of Hampshire. The seat had not been contested in either 1918 or 1922, and in a straight contest with the sitting Conservative MP, Boulton won 46% of the votes. Boulton stood again at the 1924 general election, when a Labour candidate also contested the seat. The Conservative vote increased, and Boulton's second-placed vote was less than half the Tory total. He did not stand for Parliament again."

  "text" : "Alexander Crum (1828 – 23 August 1893) was a Scottish printer and Liberal Party politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1880 to 1885. Crum was the eldest son of Walter Crum FRS of Thornliebank and his wife Jesse Graham, daughter of William Graham of Burntshiel, Renfrewshire. The Crum family were associated with the printworks which had been founded in Thornliebank in 1778. Crum's father Walter Crum was a chemist and businessman, who replaced the spinning and weaving business by calico printing. Crum ran the printworks, which was the main employment in the village, and he was also a major benefactor supporting housing, education, and leisure facilities in the village. He also provided funds for the village club and Thornliebank Parish Church. He was also a J.P. and Deputy Lieutenant of Renfrewshire. Crum was elected unopposed as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Renfrewshire at a by-election in November 1880. He held the seat until the constituency was divided at the 1885 general election, when he did not stand again. Crum died at the age of 65 and was commemorated by the library in Thormliebank, opened in 1897. Crum married in 1863, Margaret Nina Ewing, daughter of Rt Rev Alexander Ewing, Bishop of Argyll. Their daughter Margaret married Lord Kelvin. Kelvin, said of Crum \"Alexander never tired of doing good. He laboured incessantly - They had only to look round the village and the works.\""

Raphael succeeded in entering the House of Commons as a Catholic Tory from St Albans in 1847 and retained the seat until his death. Prior to serving in Parliament, he had been Sheriff of London for 1834, where he lost the tip of his left index finger in a fight with a criminal. His father was Edward Raphael who was one of the founders of the Carniac Bank in Madras, India, which opened its doors in 1788. His legacy is the Church of Saint Raphael in Surbiton, London, which he financed and had built as a family chapel. Completed in 1848, only two years before his death, it was later opened to the public as a Roman Catholic church by his nephew, Edward."

  "text" : "Alexander Ure, 1st Baron Strathclyde GBE PC QC (22 February 1853 – 2 October 1928) was a Scottish politician, judge, and georgist land value tax activist. Educated at the University of Glasgow he was admitted to membership of the Faculty of Advocates in 1878. He was Liberal Member of Parliament for Linlithgowshire from 1895 to 1913. He became a Queen's Counsel in 1897. He served as Solicitor General for Scotland from December 1905to 1909, and as Lord Advocate from February 1909 to 1913. He was an enthusiastic supporter of Lloyd George's 1909–10 budget. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1909. In 1909, he conducted the prosecution of Oscar Slater for murder; the conviction was later quashed on appeal. He lived in a huge Georgian townhouse, 31 Heriot Row, in Edinburgh's Second New Town. On leaving Parliament he was raised to the bench as Lord Strathclyde and appointed Lord Justice General, a post he held until 1920. He was raised to the Peerage as Baron Strathclyde, of Sandyford in the County of Lanark, in 1914. In 1917, he was appointed to the Order of the British Empire as a Knight Grand Cross. He is said to have been skilled in cross-examination, and was more suited to life as an advocate than as a judge. The peerage became extinct on his death."

  "text" : "Sir Alfred Hopkinson (28 June 1851 – 11 November 1939) was an English lawyer, academic and politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for two three-year periods, separated by nearly thirty years. He was the son of John Hopkinson, a mechanical engineer, and among his brothers were John Hopkinson, a physicist and electrical engineer, and Edward Hopkinson, an electrical engineer and MP. He first stood for election to the House of Commons at the 1885 general election, when he was the unsuccessful Liberal Party candidate in Manchester East. He was unsuccessful again as a Liberal Unionist candidate at the 1892 general election, when he stood in Manchester South-West. Hopkinson finally won a seat at the 1895 general election, when he was elected as MP for Cricklade in Wiltshire. He resigned from Parliament in February 1898, by the procedural device of accepting appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. Hopkinson was Vice-Chancellor of the Victoria University from 1901 to 15 July 1903 and then of the Victoria University of Manchester until 1913. In December 1914 he was appointed to the Committee on Alleged German Outrages, which in May 1915 reported on German war crimes against civilians during the invasion of Belgium in the opening months of World War I. He received the honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901. He returned to Parliament in March 1926, when he won a by-election for the Combined English Universities. He did not contest the 1929 general election. A sculpture of him by John Cassidy was exhibited at Manchester in 1912. His son Austin Hopkinson also became a Member of Parliament. One of his daughters married Sir Gerald Hurst M.P."

He was educated at Huddersfield College and entered the family worsted spinning business of D Illingworth & Sons at the age of 16. In 1865, with his brother Henry, he established the Whetley Mills, one of the largest factories in Bradford. He was also a director of the Bradford District Bank. He had strong non-conformist and free trade views and entered into politics. At the 1868 general election, Illingworth was elected MP for Knaresborough, but lost the seat in 1874. He was then elected at Bradford at the 1880 general election until the constituency was reorganised under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. At the 1885 general election he was elected for Bradford West and held the seat until 1895. Illingworth married Margaret Holden, daughter of Sir Isaac Holden, 1st Baronet in 1863 and his brother Henry married another daughter of Holden creating a strong alliance of two of the dominant Bradford families of the time. Henry was the father of Percy Illingworth and Albert Illingworth who were also active in politics in Yorkshire."

He became a national organiser of the Co-operative Party, serving until 1945.

He subsequently transferred to a union branch in Brixton, London. He was elected to the union's general council and was chairman from 1924 to 1926. He was nominated as the Labour Party candidate for the Manchester constituency of Hulme with the support of the woodworkers' union, but failed to win the seat at the 1924 general election. In 1925 he was chairman of the Dumbarton and Clydebank Labour Party, and gave evidence to an enquiry into the Clydebank Rents Strike. McElwee again stood at Hulme at the 1929 general election, and was elected. However, he became involved in a dispute with his sponsoring union, who refused to support him at the ensuing election in 1931. The Divisional Labour Party asked him to stand down as candidate, but he refused to do, and after a search for a replacement candidate he received the Labour nomination. He was defeated, with the Conservative Party regaining the constituency. In February 1932 the executive council and a number of officials of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers issued summonses alleging criminal libel against the former MP. The allegations centred on statements made in four letters written by McElwee about the union. The letters accused identifiable officials of corruption and of misappropriation of expenses. In May 1932 he entered a plea of guilty to the charges and was bound over to keep the peace on his personal recognisance of £100."

Angus was the son of William Sutherland, a crofter whose parents had suffered eviction as a consequence of the Highland Clearances. He grew up in Helmsdale and was educated at the parish school. He went on to Edinburgh Training College and Glasgow University. He taught in Aberfeldy and later became tutor to John Sinclair who was later to become Secretary for Scotland from 1905 to 1912. In 1885 he stood as crofter’s candidate for the parliamentary seat of Sutherland against the incumbent member, the Marquess of Stafford, who was eldest son of the Duke of Sutherland. Although he was unsuccessful, when there was a further election in 1886, the Marquess chose not to stand, and Sutherland was elected as an MP. After nine years as an MP, in 1894 he resigned his post and became Chairman of the Fishery Board. In this role he chaired the Scottish Departmental Committee on the North Sea Fishing Industry He was also a Member of Royal Commission on Highlands and Islands of Scotland, of the Congested Districts Board for Scotland and of the Royal Commission on Congestion in Ireland. He was appointed a Companion of the Bath in 1907."

  "text" : "Arthur Acland Allen (11 August 1868 – 20 May 1939) was a British Liberal Party politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) between 1906 and 1918. Allen was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1906 general election as MP for Christchurch in Hampshire. It was his third attempt to enter the House of Commons, having stood unsuccessfully in Thornbury in 1895 and in the Eastern Division of Dorset in 1900 general election (losing in 1900 by only 96 votes). Christchurch had been held by the Conservative Party since 1885, and at the general election in January 1910, Allen lost his seat to a Conservative. At the next general election, in December 1910, he stood instead in the Scottish constituency of Dunbartonshire, where he won the seat. However, at the 1918 general election he was not one of the 159 Liberal candidates to receive the \"coalition coupon\", and was overwhelmingly defeated by the Coalition Conservative candidate Sir William Raeburn; Allen was pushed into a poor third place behind the Labour Party candidate, winning a meagre 13% of the votes. After his defeat in 1918, he did not stand for Parliament again."

  "text" : "Arthur Anderson (* 19. Februar 1791 in Böd of Gremista, Lerwick, Shetlandinseln; † 28. Februar 1868 in Norwood, London Borough of Lambeth) war ein englischer Unternehmer und Politiker. Arthur Anderson trat zuerst in die Marine ein, die er jedoch 1815 wegen mangelnder Aussicht auf Beförderung wieder verließ, und widmete sich dem Handelswesen. Seine erste größere Unternehmung war die Beteiligung an der Ausrüstung der Expedition Dom Pedros gegen die Herrschaft Dom Miguels in Portugal. Eine hervorragende Rolle spielte er dann in der Anti-Korngesetz-Bewegung als Mitglied der League, durch Wort und Schrift für den Freihandel kämpfend. Im Jahr 1847 zum Parlamentsmitglied für die Inseln Orkney and Shetland gewählt, trat er für die Aufhebung der Navigationsakte und anderer die Entwicklung des Handels hemmender Gesetze energisch in die Schranken. Anderson war 1834 zusammen mit Brodie McGhie Willcox Gründer der Peninsular Steam Navigation Company und seit 1867 Hauptdirektor der nunmehrigen Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (\"P&O\"), welche bis in die 1950er Jahre fast den ganzen Post- und Passagierverkehr zwischen England, der iberischen Halbinsel und ab 1852 den östlichen englischen Kolonien betrieb. Anderson gründete außerdem aus seinen eignen bedeutenden Mitteln eine Bildungsanstalt für Handwerker in Norwood, eine andre in Lerwick für arme Kinder der Insel Shetland und Anstalten zur Erziehung der Kinder von Seeleuten, Handwerkern und Angehörigen der genannten Dampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft. Anderson starb am 28. Februar 1868 in Norwood bei London und fand auf dem West Norwood Cemetery (London Brough of Lambeth) seine letzte Ruhestätte.

He held a number of other positions, including Chairman of the Governors of Manchester Grammar School, treasurer of Mansfield College, Oxford and chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. He also served as a major in the 1st Volunteer Battalion, The Cheshire Regiment. At the 1906 general election he was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament for Manchester South, and was created a baronet, of Dunham Massey in the County of Chester, in 1911. In February 1912 he was appointed a Junior Lord of the Treasury by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. However, when he sought re-election to Parliament following this appointment he was defeated by the Unionist candidate Philip Glazebrook. He was a Liberal candidate at the next general election in 1918 in the Manchester Exchange constituency but did not receive the coupon and failed to be elected. Haworth married Lily Rigby in 1891 and they had three children. Haworth died at his home \"Normanby\", Altrincham, in August 1944, aged 79."

He was re-elected unopposed in 1906. He was a Unionist Free Trader and resigned from the Conservative Party in February 1906, crossing the floor to join the Liberal Party. He stood down from the House of Commons at the January 1910 general election. In June 1918, the Liberal MP for Buckrose became ill and was looking to retire. The local Liberal Association selected Taylor as their candidate to succeed him. Due to the war-time electoral truce, Taylor expected to be elected in a by-election unopposed. However, the by-election was not called and a General Election was called for December instead. A Labour candidate was chosen to contest the seat. Taylor hoped to receive endorsement from the Coalition government, but at the eleventh hour, that endorsement was given to a latecomer to the contest, who stood as a Coalition Liberal and was elected instead."

  "text" : "Benjamin Charles Spoor PC (2 June 1878 – 22 December 1928) was a British Labour Party politician. He took a particular interest in India. Born in Witton Park, County Durham, he went to Elmfield College, York, and came from a family of Primitive Methodists. An engineer by training, he later went into business as a builder's merchant. Before entering politics he was a lay preacher in the Methodist Church. At the 1918 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament for the Bishop Auckland constituency, and held the seat until his death at the age of 50. In parliament, he found himself at odds with many Labour MPs and contemplated joining the Liberals. He was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and Chief Whip in 1924, when he was made a Privy Councillor. He had suffered from poor health since contracting malaria at Salonika during World War I. On a visit to London in December 1928, he was found dead in bed at the Regent Palace Hotel. At the inquest, his son said that his father had taken to drinking heavily. His death, it was decided, was due to syncope from disease of the heart and liver, due to chronic alcoholism."

In the 1880 general election, Armitage was elected as one of two members of parliament for Salford. Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the Salford constituency was divided into three divisions, and Armitage was elected as the first MP for the new Salford West seat at the 1885 general election. A further election was held in 1886, and he was defeated by his Conservative opponent, Lees Knowles. Armitage did not re-enter parliament. In January 1899 he was awarded the freedom of the Borough of Salford. In 1856 he married Elizabeth Southam of Manchester. They made their home at Chomlea Bank, Pendleton."

He was a teacher and lecturer and a trade union branch official. O'Malley was elected Member of Parliament for Rotherham in a 1963 by-election. He served as a government whip from 1964 to 1969. He was junior Health and Social Security Minister from 1969 to 1970, and became Minister of State for that department in 1974. O'Malley's crowning achievement was obtaining cross-party support for a new State pension scheme (after two aborted attempts by previous Governments) and steering through Parliament the bill to implement what became the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. While Barbara Castle, the Secretary of State, took much of the credit, it was O'Malley who did all the hard work. In 1976, O'Malley's career was cut short by his death at the age of 46, following complications after brain surgery. Stanley Crowther was elected as his successor in the subsequent by-election."

The circumstances of his later life and premature death are cited by physicians who believe the overwhelming evidence for the biological etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome. Brynmor John had been diagnosed with the illness, and died suddenly immediately after exiting the House of Commons gym.

  "text" : "Caleb Wright (1 August 1810 – 28 April 1898) was a mill owner and Liberal politician in Lancashire, north-west England. He was one of thirteen children of William Wright, bookmaker of Tyldesley, near Manchester. At the age of nine he began work as a \"piecer\" in a local cotton mill. The only education he received was by attending night schools. At the age of fifteen he became a spinner, and rose to become manager of the mill in 1830. In 1841 he became manager of Ormerod and Hardcastles Mill, Bolton.In 1845 he established his own cotton-spinning business in partnership with Henry Barton. In 1855 the partnership was dissolved, and Caleb Wright and Company, Barnfield Mills, Tyldesley, established. Wright was a Unitarian, a member of the congregation at Chowbent Chapel where he succeeded his father as organist. Wright became involved in Liberal politics, and was chairman of Tyldesley Local Board and president of the local Mechanics' Institute. In the 1885 general election Caleb Wright was invited to stand as the candidate for the newly created Leigh division by the Liberal party. His Tory opponent was Lees Knowles who polled 3,725 votes as against 4,261 for Wright. He was elected as the first member of parliament for the new constituency of Leigh. He was re-elected at the next two general elections, before retiring from parliament in 1895. Politically Wright was an advanced radical, and supported both Home Rule for Ireland and women's suffrage. He was also a member of the Liberation Society which sought the disestablishment of the Church of England. Caleb Wright died at his home, Lower Oak, in Shakerley, Tyldesley in 1898 aged 87. He was a Unitarian and is buried at Chowbent Chapel."

  "text" : "Charles Cecil Cotes (7 April 1846 – 9 August 1898) was a British landowner and Liberal politician. Cotes was born in 1846, eldest surviving son of John Cotes of Woodcote Hall near Newport, Shropshire (himself a former MP) and his wife Lady Louisa Jenkinson, daughter of Charles Jenkinson, 3rd Earl of Liverpool, and thus nephew of the former Prime Minister, the 2nd Earl. He was educated at Eton College, then entered Christ Church, Oxford in 1864, graduating as B.A. in 1869. Cotes served in the South Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry as lieutenant before being promoted captain in 1869. This regiment amalgamated to form the unified Shropshire Yeomanry in 1872, and he continued to serve with them until he retired in 1880. Cotes first sought election to Parliament for the then two-member borough seat of Shrewsbury at a by-election following the death of William Clement in 1870 and polled 1,253 votes but was defeated by a majority of 38 by his Conservative opponent, Douglas Straight. Cotes petitioned against the result but the case was dismissed in court with costs. He entered Parliament for Shrewsbury at the 1874 general election, and held the seat until 1885. That year Shrewsbury was reduced to a one-member seat and Cotes did not seek further election to Parliament. When the Liberals came to power in 1880 under William Ewart Gladstone, he was appointed a Junior Lord of the Treasury, which he remained until the government fell in 1885. Following his father's death in 1874, Cotes succeeded to his estates in Shropshire and Staffordshire in England and Montgomeryshire in Wales, which in 1876 amounted to 6,470 acres with an income of £8.860 a year. He had Woodcote Hall rebuilt after a disastrous fire. He reputedly owned the first motor car registered in Shropshire, vehicle registration number \"AW1\". Cotes was a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for the counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire and at the time of his death was a trustee of the Harper Adams Agricultural College which was then being erected near Newport. Cotes died suddenly at Woodcote Hall, of a heart attack, in August 1898, aged 52, and was buried on 12 August in Woodcote churchyard. He was unmarried and his estates passed to his brother."

Harrison entered business with Mr B Devey, a wharfinger at Stourport-on-Severn. Among the goods that were dealt with on the wharf were locally produced carpets of George Harris. On Harris's retirement Harrison purchased his carpet manufacturing business, and continued to actively run the company until shortly before his death. Apart from his business activities, Harrison was a magistrate for Worcestershire and a member of the Stourport local board and a number of other institutions in the area. In 1874 he was invited to stand as Liberal candidate for the parliamentary borough of Bewdley in place of Augustus Anson who had retired from parliament. Harrison held the seat for the Liberals, defeating his Conservative opponent Stanley Leighton by 514 votes to 405. At the ensuing general election in 1880 Harrison was re-elected, defeating K E Webster by 598 votes to 530. However, Harrison was unseated on petition, and retired from parliamentary politics. Harrison made his home at Areley Court, Areley Kings, near Stourport. He married Elizabeth Augusta Kempson of Edgbaston, Birmingham in 1858. He died at his home in May 1888 after a long illness."

  "text" : "(For other people named Charles Harrison, see Charles Harrison (disambiguation).) Charles Harrison (1 August 1835 – 24 December 1897) was a British Liberal Party politician. Harrison was born in Muswell Hill, Middlesex, and was the third son of Frederick Harrison, a stockbroker, and his wife, Jane Brice. He was educated at King's College School and King's College London. In 1858 he entered business as a solicitor at the firm of his uncle, also named Charles Harrison. He acquired a large practice in his own right, with major clients being the London Chatham and Dover Railway and the Law Fire Insurance Society. He became an advocate of the rights of tenants to purchase their properties and of the provision of housing for the working classes. In this he was in agreement with the policies of the Radical wing of the Liberal Party. In 1886 he married Lady Harriet Barlow. His active involvement with politics came with the creation of the London County Council in 1889. He was elected as one of the council's first members, representing Bethnal Green South West as a member of the Liberal-backed Progressive Party. He was a leading member of the council, and vice-chairman from 1892 – 1895. His interests in the government of the capital led him to call for the municipalisation of the London docks and the unification of the City of London with the county. On two occasions Harrison stood for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons on behalf of the Liberals. In 1892 he failed to be elected at Plymouth. He stood again at the ensuing general election in 1895, and became one of the town's two members of parliament, while continuing to hold his seat on the London County Council. Harrison became suddenly ill with inflammation of the throat at the funeral of Sir Frank Lockwood on 23 December 1897 and died at his London home on the following day from heart failure."

  "text" : "Charles James Monk (30 November 1824 – 10 November 1900) was an English Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1857 and 1885. Monk was born at Peterborough, the son of Rt. Rev. James Henry Monk Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, and his wife Jane Smart Hughes daughter of Rev. Hugh Hughes of Huneaton Warwickshire. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he was the Sir W Browne's Medallist in 1845, University Members Prizeman in 1846 and 1847 and he graduated junior optime in 1847. In 1850, he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. He became Chancellor of the diocese of Bristol in 1855 and Chancellor of diocese of Gloucester in 1859. He was also a Deputy Lieutenant and J.P. for Gloucestershire At the 1857 general election Monk stood for parliament unsuccessfully at Cricklade. He was elected as one of the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Gloucester at the 1859 general election but was unseated on petition. He was re-elected for Gloucester in 1865 and held the seat until 1885. He was author of the Revenue Officers' Disabilities Removal Act, 1868. Monk did not stand in the 1885 general election, when the parliamentary borough of Gloucester was abolished and the name transferred to a new county division with the same name, but covering a bigger area. He unsuccessfully contested the new seat in 1892, but won it in 1895 and held it until he stood down at the 1900 general election, shortly before his death. Monk was President of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom from 1881 to 1884 and became a director of the Suez Canal Company in 1884. He was author of The Golden Horn. Monk lived at Bedwell Park, Hatfield, Hertshire, where he died at the age of 75. Monk married Julia Ralli, daughter of P. S. Ralli of London in 1853."

Mallet was returned to Parliament for Plymouth in 1906. In 1908 he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Walter Runciman who was President of the Board of Education. In February 1910 Asquith was considering him as a possible Chief Whip but was dissuaded by the outgoing Chief Whip Jack Pease who felt he was out of sympathy with many leading Liberals over the Lords. In March 1910 Prime Minister H. H. Asquith appointed him Financial Secretary to the War Office, a position he held until he was defeated in the December general election of the same year. He sought a return to parliament at the Salford North by-election, 1917 as a Coalition Liberal candidate but was defeated by an Independent Labour candidate. He did not contest the 1918 General Election. He was Honorary Secretary of the Free Trade Union. He became a supporter of the official Liberal party that opposed the Coalition Government. He sought to make a return to parliament standing as Liberal candidate for South Aberdeen, in 1922 without success. He tried again in 1923 without success. He had published two works on Liberal politicians; Mr Lloyd George, a Study (1930) and Herbert Gladstone, a Memoir (1932). His book on Lloyd George was entirely devoted to the shortcomings of the Liberal Leader."

  "text" : "Sir Christopher Thomas Needham (30 August 1866 – 29 April 1944) was a British businessman and Liberal politician. Needham was educated at Manchester Grammar School and the University of Manchester. He was to maintain a link with the university throughout his life, becoming a governor in 1908, a chairman of the council from 1936 to 1941. He became a partner in the family company, John Needham and Sons of Manchester, iron and steel merchants. He stood as Liberal candidate for the constituency of Manchester South West at the January 1910 general election, but was defeated by the Conservative, Arthur Colefax. The position was reversed at the ensuing election in December, when Needham unseated Colefax to become a member of parliament. He held the seat until 1918. After leaving parliament, Needham was knighted in 1919, and expanded his business interests. He became chairman of the Manchester and Liverpool District Banking Company in 1922. He remained chairman of the company (renamed the District Bank) until 1936. He was chairman of the National Boiler and General Insurance Company and was also a director of the London and North Eastern Railway, the Manchester Ship Canal and the Alliance Assurance company. Outside of business, he was chairman of Lancashire County Cricket Club from 1941 to 1943. He married Florence White in 1902, and they had one daughter before her death in 1905. Sir Christopher Needham died at his home in West Didsbury in 1944, aged 77."

  "text" : "Sir Daniel Ford Goddard PC (17 January 1850 – 6 May 1922) was a British civil engineer, businessman and Liberal Party politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Ipswich from 1895 to 1918. He was the son of son Ebenezer Goddard, C.E., J.P., of Ipswich, Suffolk, and his wife Annie, née Kurd. Educated privately, he married Lucy Corsbie in 1874. She died in 1875, and in 1877 he married Elizabeth Harwood. A director of several companies, he was an alderman of Ipswich, and served as the town's mayor from 1891 to 1892. At the 1892 general election, he stood for Parliament, but failed to dislodge either of Ipswich's two Conservative MPs. However, he won the seat in 1895, and held it until the 1918 general election, when Ipswich's parliamentary representation was reduced to one seat and he did not seek re-election. Goddard was knighted on 16 December 1907  and was sworn as a Privy Councillor on 27 Jan 1916."

  "text" : "David Austick (8 March 1920 – 9 February 1997) was a British Liberal Party politician and bookshop owner. At a by-election in July 1973 caused by the death of the sitting Conservative MP Sir Malcolm Stoddart-Scott, Austick was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Ripon in North Yorkshire, gaining the seat from the Conservatives by a majority of 946 votes. However, it was a short-lived success. In the February 1974 general election, Austick lost by 4,335 votes to the new Conservative candidate Keith Hampson after seven months as an MP. Austick was never again elected an MP, but he also served as a district and county councillor in Yorkshire and was one time Chairman of the Liberal Candidates' Association. He later became Executive Chairman of the Electoral Reform Society."

He was an economist and market research expert and was secretary of the Labour Party's research department. At the 1959 general election, he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Dewsbury in West Yorkshire. In 1981, Ginsburg was among the Labour MPs who defected to the new Social Democratic Party. In 1983, he polled 25% of the vote in Dewsbury, coming third and possibly having the effect of splitting the Labour vote and helping the Conservative candidate John Whitfield win. Ginsburg died in 1994 on his 73rd birthday."

  "text" : "David Llewellyn Mort (25 March 1888 – 1 January 1963) was a British Labour Party politician. Born in Briton Ferry, Glamorgan, he left school aged thirteen when his father died. After initially working in an outfitters shop, he subsequently entered the local steel works. From the age of sixteen he was a preacher in the Congregational Church. Mort joined the Independent Labour Party in 1906, and in 1915 became South Wales secretary of the Steel Trades Confederation. He was also involved in local politics as a member of Briton Ferry Urban District Council and Neath Borough Council. At the 1929 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Eccles. The Second Labour Government formed after the election subsequently collapsed and a National Government was formed. The government went to the country in a general election in October 1931. Mort, along with the majority of Labour MPs, lost his seat. Mort stood, unsuccessfully, at the 1935 general election in Bilston. He was returned to the House of Commons as MP for Swansea East at an unopposed by-election in 1940, following the death of the Labour MP David Williams. He held the seat until his own death in 1963 aged 74, triggering another by-election."

  "text" : "David Graham Pole (11 December 1877 – 26 November 1952) was a British Labour Party politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for South Derbyshire from 1929 to 1931. His parents were John Pole, a ship's captain, and Rossina Graham, both from Shetland. Pole was an unsuccessful candidate at four times: in East Grinstead at the 1918 general election; at the Edinburgh North by-election in 1920; in Cardiff South 1922 general election; and in Cardiff Central 1924 general election. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for South Derbyshire at the 1929 general election, but was defeated at the 1931 general election by the Conservative Party candidate Paul Emrys-Evans. Pole did not stand for Parliament again. He died in Marylebone aged 74. Pole was both a Fabian Society and a Theosophical Society activist. As such he defended Annie Besant's taking and retention of Jiddhu Krishnamurti and his brother Nityananda from their Indian magistrate father. Per James Webb, The Occult Underground (Open Court Press, 1974), Pole edited a Theosophical publication Theosophy in Scotland among his many Theosophical endeavors."

He contested Stoke Newington unsuccessfully at the 1935 general election but went on to win it in the 1945 election. In October 1947, he was convicted of conspiracy related to unlawful supply of toilet preparations (lipstick) by his brothers' Newington Supply Co. contrary to wartime regulations, and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and fined £500. This was quashed in March 1948. For the 1950 election his seat was reconstituted as Hackney North and Stoke Newington and he went on to represent the constituency for a further 29 years. For the five years leading up to his retirement in 1979, he was the last sitting British MP born in the 19th century, the oldest member of the House of Commons, and the last Member of Parliament to have served in the First World War. After his retirement, Robert Edwards became the oldest sitting British MP."

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for the marginal Middleton and Prestwich constituency from 1966 to 1970, when it was gained by the Conservative Alan Haselhurst. Coe was born in Whitley Bay, Northumberland. He earned a Scout Silver Medal for Gallantry after saving a young girl from drowning in Cullercoats Bay when he was 14. He served in the armed forces before returning to the North East to begin a career in teaching. He later left the area again to move to London, where he studied economics at the London School of Economics. This triggered his move into politics and he was elected to Middleton and Prestwich as a Labour MP in 1966. Following the 1970 election, Coe worked in the arts world and went on to establish the British Youth Opera. In 2008, he published his memoirs – Variety Certainly Adds Spice."

Macfarlane was born in Scotland, the youngest son of Allan Macfarlane J.P., of Caithness and his wife Margaret Horne. He became an East Indies merchant as a tea trader and indigo plantation owner. While in India he was a passionate amateur photographer. He experimented freely and produced semi-abstract images. At the 1880 general election Macfarlane was elected as a Home Rule Member of Parliament for Carlow County. The Carlow constituency lost one of its two seats under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, and at the 1885 general election Macfarlane stood instead for the Crofters Party in Argyllshire. He won the seat, but lost it in 1886. He was re-elected (by a narrow margin) at the 1892 general elections as a Liberal/Crofters candidate, holding it until a further defeat in 1895. He was knighted in 1894. Macfarlane married Mary Isabella Bagshawe in 1857"

  "text" : "Gwilym Ednyfed Hudson Davies (born 4 December 1929) is a Welsh former politician. Hudson Davies was educated at Dynevor Grammar School, Swansea, the University College, Wales in Swansea, and Balliol College, Oxford. He became a lecturer in government and a broadcaster. Davies was elected Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Conway in 1966, serving there until 1970. He was later elected for Caerphilly, in 1979. In 1981, he was among the Labour MPs who defected to the new Social Democratic Party. In 1983, in Caerphilly, it was the Liberal side of the SDP-Liberal Alliance which put up a candidate. Davies therefore did not stand in Caerphilly, but was adopted in Basingstoke. He lost comprehensively as it was a strongly Conservative seat. The Liberals also did not win in Caerphilly. Hudson-Davies remains active in public life as chairman of a museum trust in the New Forest."

  "text" : "Edward Ryley (or Riley) Langworthy (1797 - 7 April 1874) was a British businessman and Liberal politician. Langworthy was born in London, the son of a Somerset merchant. After spending some years in South and Central America, he moved to Salford, Lancashire in 1840 to establish a cotton business with his brother, George. Langworthy Brothers and Company was established at Greengate Mills. When Salford was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1844, Langworthy was elected as the first alderman for Trinity ward. He was the borough's fifth mayor, elected for two consecutive terms from 1848 to 1850. His term as mayor saw the establishment of the free public museum and library at Peel Park In January 1857, Salford's Liberal member of parliament, Joseph Brotherton, died. Langworthy was selected as the party's candidate for the vacancy, and as the only nominee, was elected unopposed on 2 February. Following his election he gave a speech outlining his political views: he supported the temperance movement, free trade and civil and religious freedom, the reform of parliament, strengthened local government, but opposed any increase in the size of the country's armed forces. He was only Salford's MP for a matter of months, as he did not stand at the subsequent general election later in the year. Langworthy retained his connection with Salford Corporation, and on his death in 1874 left £10,000 to the museum and library he had helped establish. Langworthy Road, constructed shortly after his death, was named in his memory by Salford Borough Council."

He was a miner and a branch official and national executive member of the National Union of Mineworkers. For twenty years he served as a councillor on Wombwell Urban District Council. Wainwright was Member of Parliament for Dearne Valley from 1959 to 1983, when the seat was abolished in boundary changes. In 1983 whilst at the House of Commons, Wainwright \"got so drunk that he babbled incoherently\". Hansard mildly recorded his speech as \"Mr. Wainwright made a number of observations.\""

He served as a Liverpool Borough Councillor for the ward of Croxteth from 1959 to his selection as the parliamentary candidate for West Derby. He was selected by over 80% of the West Derby constituency party to stand for election he defeated future MP Robert Parry. He was originally elected Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool West Derby at the 1964 general election, but was among the Labour MPs who defected to the new Social Democratic Party in 1981. At the 1983 general election, he sought re-election but came third with 18% of the vote while the Labour candidate Robert Wareing won. It was a time of intense political change and Eric no longer thought that the party he joined was any longer true to the political principles he believed in. He was a member of the Stamps Advisory Committee and Chairman of the Falkland Islands Association (he visited the Islands on at least three separate occasions before and after the conflict). He enjoyed photography and gardening and was a keen independent traveller. He married twice and has a son by his first wife and two sons by his second wife, Marjorie Ogden, who died on 24 March 2010."

Following a private education, he went into business as a wine merchant, and in 1894 established Hatch, Mansfield and Company. Hatch was unsuccessful Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Gorton Division of Lancashire at a by-election in 1889 and at the succeeeding general election in 1892. On his third attempt, in the 1895 election, he was elected as Gorton's MP. Hatch remained as Conservative member for Gorton until 1904, when his disagreement with Joseph Chamberlain over free trade led to him crossing the floor to the Liberal Party. At the next general election in 1906 he had little support from Liberal activists for his candidature, and accordingly withdrew. In 1908 he was created a baronet, \"of Portland Place, in the Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone\". He was appointed chairman and treasurer of University College Hospital, London During the First World War he chaired the Government Commission on Belgian Refugees, and was made a commander of the Belgian Order of the Crown. He was also Chairman of Council of the Beyond Seas Association for Reception of Officers and Relatives from beyond the seas, and for this he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1920 New Year Honours. Ernest Hatch married Lady Constance Blanche Godolphin Osborne in 1900, aunt of John Osborne, later Duke of Leeds. They had one daughter, and the baronetcy became extinct on Sir Edward's death in 1927."

  "text" : "Ernest Amherst Villiers (14 November 1863–26 September 1923), was a British clergyman and Liberal politician. Villiers was the son of Reverend Charles Villiers of Croft, Yorkshire, and his wife Florence Mary (née Tyssen-Amherst). His great-grandfather, the Hon. George Villiers, was the third son of Thomas Villiers, 1st Earl of Clarendon. Educated at Uppingham School and Peterhouse, Cambridge, he was ordained as an Anglican priest. After three years as a curate in Halifax, he became rector of Haveringland, Norfolk. Villiers married the Hon. Elaine Augusta, daughter of Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, in 1898. The couple had 2 sons and 2 daughters. He resigned from holy orders to pursue a political career, and was elected to the House of Commons for Brighton at a by-election on 5 April 1905 caused by the appointment of one of the two members as a minister. He won the by-election by 817 votes and held the seat at the 1906 general election, increasing his majority to 853, but then chose not to contest the January 1910 general election. Villiers died at his residence, Speen Court, Newbury, Berkshire in September 1923, aged 59. He was buried in the graveyard of Speen Parish Church."

Luard was educated at Felsted School and King's College, Cambridge where he gained a First in Modern Languages. In 1950, Luard joined the Foreign Service and after learning Chinese he was stationed in Peking from 1952 to 1954. In 1956 he resigned from the diplomatic service in protest at Britain's involvement in the Suez Crisis. He became a research fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford in 1957 where he was able to research Chinese relations with Britain. He was a Labour councillor on Oxford City Council 1958–61. Luard was Member of Parliament (MP) for Oxford from 1966 to 1970 and again from October 1974 to 1979 for the Labour Party, having first contested the seat in 1964; he was the only Labour member ever to represent the constituency in its original form. He served as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Foreign Office from 1969 till 1970 and again from 1976 until Labour left power in 1979. Luard joined the SDP soon after its formation, and contested the 1983 General election for the party in the newly formed constituency of Oxford West and Abingdon. He was de-selected in 1987 in favour of Chris Huhne. Luard is also known for his sociological theories including the hierarchy theory. His exhaustive study of war, War in International Society: A Study in International Sociology, was published in Britain in 1986 and by Yale University Press in the United States in 1987."

  "text" : "Evelyn Walkden (Oct 1893 - 12 September 1970) was a British politician and trades unionist. The son of a Lancashire miners' leader, he left school at 12 and fought in the First World War. He became a trade union organiser in 1928 and worked in that role until 1941 when he was elected unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Doncaster, having unsuccessfully contested the seat of Rossendale in 1935 and having been prospective candidate for West Toxteth in 1939. From 1944 to 1945 he was parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of National Insurance. Re-elected in the 1945 general election, he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of Food, and served in this role until 1946. In 1947, in the course of an investigation by the parliamentary Committee of Privileges into claims that Labour members had given information to journalists about confidential meetings of the Labour Party in return for payment, Walkden admitted revealing information to the Evening News. He was found guilty of breach of privilege by the Committee and reprimanded by the Speaker. Another MP, Garry Allighan, was expelled from the House, but Walkden was not as he admitted the offence and had paid tax on the money he had been paid. He resigned the party whip and sat as an independent until the 1950 election, in which he did not stand. Lord Robens commented after his death that Walkden was \"an able Trade Union official and an able Parliamentarian and worked hard to bring about reforms in the rationing systems during the war. He was a thorn in the side of the black marketeers and his activities led to the closing of many loopholes.\""

He joined the Royal Navy in 1840, and immediately saw active service due to the Oriental Crisis of that year: he served off the Syrian coast and was present at the bombardment of Acre. During the Crimean War he was in command of HMS Bailisk and in 1855 he reached the rank of captain. Egerton married Lady Louisa Caroline, daughter of William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, and sister of Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire, in 1861. He was aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria from 1865-1873. In 1873 he was promoted to rear admiral and he was placed on the retired list in November 1875. Following his retirement he continued to be promoted: in 1878 to vice admiral and in 1884 to the rank of admiral. He also sat as Member of Parliament for Derbyshire East from 1868 to 1885 and for Derbyshire North-East from 1885 to 1886. In his later years he was a resident of Surrey, where he continued his political activities as president of the Chertsey Division of the Central Liberal Council. He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of the county in 1893. He died at his home in Weybridge from heart disease aged 71 and was buried at Byfleet."

  "text" : "Frank Julian Allaun (27 February 1913 – 26 November 2002) was a British Labour politician. Born in Manchester, Allaun was educated at Manchester Grammar School and worked as an engineer, shop assistant, tour leader, chartered accountant and journalist. He helped to organise the first Aldermaston March in 1958 and was chair of the Labour Peace Fellowship. Allaun was against British membership of the EEC. Allaun contested Manchester Moss Side in 1951. He was Member of Parliament for Salford East from 1955 to 1983. He was a veteran of leftwing causes, especially the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), of which he was vice president from 1983. He was the first President of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy in 1973. Allaun wrote several books on nuclear weapons including Stop the H-Bomb Race (1959) and The Wasted 30 Billions (1975). Naive or optimistic, or just unappreciative of war culture, Allaun was a straight up-and-down idealist. His style was intensely gentle, the voice never raised, but the questions - chiefly on peace and housing - insistent. The beautiful manners and the soft Lancashire voice must have got on ministerial nerves. But then, as one of the organisers of the first Aldermaston march, he helped launch a movement whose appeal in the late 1950s and 1960s did more than get on nerves. Outside the peace movement, his preoccupation was with public housing, and the vastly increased expenditure he urged should be paid for by cuts, equally massive, in defence. Defence cuts would, of course, come, but, despite Allaun's life work, Britain remained a nuclear power. Frank Allaun retired from the House of Commons in 1983 but continued to be active in politics. This included writing the books Spreading the News: A Guide To Media Reform (1989) and The Struggle for Peace (1992). His recreations were walking and swimming. His first wife died in 1986, and on 3 June 1989 he married Millicent (Millie) Bobker, née Greenberg, a widow and retired civil servant. He died in Manchester in 2002 aged 89. His second wife, son and daughter survived him."

Haynes served until 1992 when he retired and was succeeded by Geoff Hoon. Haynes was famous for having one of the loudest voices in the House of Commons. He was sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers, and during the 1984-85 strike remained loyal to the union rather than support the majority of Nottinghamshire miners who broke away to form the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. He frequently highlighted the problems of the very poorest in society when putting questions to Margaret Thatcher and her ministers. Haynes died in Westwood, Nottingham, in September 1998 at the age of 72."

  "text" : "Frank Marsden (15 October 1923 – 5 November 2006) was a British Labour Party politician. He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Scotland from 1971 to 1974. Marsden was born in Everton in Liverpool, and was educated at Abbotsford Road Secondary School. He volunteered to join the RAF in 1941, aged 18, and served with 115 Squadron, which flew Lancaster bombers from bases in East Anglia in the Second World War. He married his wife, Muriel, in 1943, and was demobilised as a warrant officer in 1948. He returned to Liverpool and worked as a salesman for Fitzpatricks (a wholesale greengrocer and flower merchant), as a crane driver in Liverpool Docks, and then as a telephonist for the General Post Office. He joined the Labour party in 1948, and became member of Liverpool City Council for the St Domingo ward in 1964. He lost his seat in 1967, but was re-elected for the Vauxhall ward in 1969. He resigned from the council when he was elected as MP for Liverpool Scotland in a by-election held in April 1971, after the sitting Labour MP Walter Alldritt had resigned to become regional secretary of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers. Marsden had previously served at Alldritt's agent. In Parliament, Marsden was a strong supporter of comprehensive schools. Marsden's constituency was merged with the neighbouring Liverpool Exchange for the February 1974 general election, and Robert Parry won the selection for the new Liverpool Scotland Exchange seat. Marsden returned to his job at the GPO. He remained a loyal supporter of the Labour Party, and was later elected as a councillor on Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council and Merseyside County Council. He disagreed with the Militant tendency in the 1980s. His wife died in 2001, but Marsden was survived by their three sons. He died in Liverpool."

He was the son of Charles Walter Raffety, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire and attended the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe. In 1898 he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple, and practised on the Northern Circuit. He developed an interest in politics, and became honorary secretary of the Social and Political Education League. The organisation was established to provide political education to the general public, and in particular to promote moderation over revolution. He was also an active member of the Eighty Club, an educational group within the Liberal Party. He was selected as Liberal prospective parliamentary candidate for Stamford for a general election expected to take place in 1915. He unsuccessfully contested the Lewisham West by-election in September 1921; In March of the following year he was elected to the London County Council, as a (Liberal-backed) Progressive Party councillor for Islington West; At the general election in November 1922 he failed to win Bristol West; A further general election was held in 1923, and Raffety was elected Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Bath; His membership of the Commons was brief, as he was defeated when a further general election was called in 1924; He again stood as a Liberal candidate at Cheltenham in 1929; and East Dorset in 1935, but failed to be elected; Raffety remained active in Liberal party politics, as a speaker. He became the Chairman of the Industrial Co-Partnership Association. In 1943 he was granted the freedom of the borough of High Wycombe, of which he had been honorary recorder since 1905. In 1945 he was made an Officer of the Order of British Empire. He died at his home in Bramley, Surrey in August 1946, aged 71."

  "text" : "Franklin 'Frankie' Thomasson (16 August 1873 –29 October 1941) was an English 20th century MP. Descended from a well known family of cotton spinners from Bolton, Lancashire, Franklin Thomasson was born on 16 August 1873 at Alderley Edge, Cheshire, the 3rd child of John Pennington Thomasson, who was a benefactor and MP for Bolton. He married Elizabeth, a daughter of the late Caleb Coffin of New York on 11 July 1895. They had 3 children, John (1898), Marjorie (1901) and Barbara (1903). Franklin contested the Westhoughton Parliamentary division in 1900, and Stretford in 1901, but on both occasions he was unsuccessful. He became Liberal MP for Leicester at a by-election in 1906, however, sharing the representation of the double-member constituency with Ramsay MacDonald. He retired at the January 1910 election. In 1906, Thomasson ventured on a bold but disastrous experiment in newspaper production by founding the Tribune (1906–1908). He played a large part in local political life before he left Bolton for London. During World War I he commanded the 2-5th Battalion Loyal North Lancashire Regiment. His wife Elizabeth died in 1927 and he then married Gertrude Prescott. They had three children, Margaret (1930), Christopher (1932) and Jenny (1937). Franklin died of cancer on 29 October 1941 aged 68 and was buried at Lyndhurst, Hampshire."

Born and brought up in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, and educated at elementary school, he began work aged 13 as a moulder-apprentice, joining the Moulders' Union in 1914. In the same year he was awarded a place at Ruskin College, Oxford. He also joined the Independent Labour Party and was elected to its National Council. In the First World War he became active in the Union of Democratic Control, and was arrested for making a speech appealing for immediate peace negotiations. In 1916 he was offered the chance of exemption from military service on trade and health grounds, but preferred to take his stand as a conscientious objector. Refused exemption in that category, he was forcibly enlisted, and sentenced to two years imprisonment for disobeying an order; he then accepted the Home Office Scheme, and was transferred to Princetown Work Centre in the erstwhile Dartmoor Prison. Fred Longden was elected Member of Parliament for Birmingham Deritend, 1929-1931 and 1945-1950, and then in 1950 for Birmingham Small Heath, which he retained until his death in 1952 aged 58."

He later became a maintenance engineer in the 2LO station which later became the BBC. In 1926 he became chief engineer of the Indian Broadcasting Company in Calcutta, where he remained for three years before becoming the general manager of a firm in High Wycombe producing radio and television equipment. In the landslide election of 1945 he won the Elland constituency from the Conservatives. When this seat was abolished for the 1950 general election he transferred to the new constituency of Brighouse and Spenborough which covered much of the same area. He died just over a month later, aged 49, making the government's slender majority even more precarious until the party held the seat a by-election in May 1950."

Lehmann stood unsuccessfully for parliament at Middlesex in 1874 and Waterford in 1877. He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Evesham at a by-election in July 1880, by a majority of only two votes. A petition was lodged and the result voided. Scrutiny of the votes led to his opponent Frederick Dixon-Hartland being declared the winner in January 1881, with a majority of one vote. Lehmann married Nina Chambers, daughter of Dr Robert Chambers of Edinburgh. Their social circle included Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Robert Browning, Lord Leighton, and other prominent figures. Their sons were Rudolf Chambers Lehmann (a Liberal politician), Frederick Hope Lehmann and Ernest Benzon Lehmann. They had one daughter, Nina Frederika Mary Teba Lehmann, who married Sir Guy Theophilus Campbell. His son Frederick had an affair with the actress Minnie Duncan (whose sister was much better known as an actress - Emily Mary Duncan) Their two sons Frederic Archibald Duncan (1884) and John (Jack) Lehmann Duncan (1886) may not have known the identity of their father (who signed the register for their baptisms as 'Frederic Duncan, Gentleman' . Minnie lived in a large house with servants in London - and the census noted her as 'Minnie Lehmann' - single. Minnie married Lt Col Hugh Charles Fortescue in 1892. Lehmann died at the age of 65."

He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Colne Valley at a by-election in 1916. He was re-elected as a Coalition Liberal at the 1918 general election, when because of his support for Lloyd George's Coalition Government, the Conservative Party did not field a candidate. However, a Conservative candidate did stand at the 1922 general election, and Mallalieu was reduced to third place, losing his seat to the Labour Party's Philip Snowden. His share of the vote had fallen from 58.8% in 1918 to only 25.1% in 1922. Mallalieu did not stand for Parliament again, and died in 1932, aged 71. Two of his sons were elected to the House of Commons:"

Between his election and his death, he was the youngest member of the House of Commons, having been elected at the age of 22 years 259 days. A captain in the 4th Battalion Grenadier Guards, Grey was killed at Le Repas in Normandy, France, on the first day of Operation Bluecoat. He was buried on the battlefield by his men, on the site of which his family later erected a memorial. The site is now recognised as a war grave, designated the Livry Isolated Grave. William Beveridge retained Berwick for the Liberals in the subsequent by-election."

He became apprenticed to the lithographic printing trade in York. Following his apprenticeship, he worked as a printer in London, Birmingham, Leeds and Bradford. He moved to Manchester to become general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers, formed in 1880. Kelley was an early proponent of the Labour movement putting forward candidates for election. He became vice-president of the Labour Electoral Association in 1889, and presided at the Labour Electoral Congress held in Hanley in 1890. He was elected to the parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress in 1892. He held the office of secretary of a number of bodies: the Manchester Trades and Labour Council, the Lancashire and Cheshire Federation of Trade Councils, the Manchester and District Board of Conciliation and the National Printing and Kindred Trades Federation. In 1902 he travelled to New York as part of Alfred Moseley's Commission of Inquiry into the organisation of Labour. Two years later as vice-chairman of the National Committee of Organised Labour, he campaigned for the introduction of a universal old age pension. At the 1906 general election he was selected as one of the Labour Representation Committee candidates, and was elected as Member of Parliament for Manchester South West, unseating the sitting Conservative MP. Due to ill-health he retired from parliament at the next general election in January 1910. He died in Manchester in December 1911, aged 63."

Dodd was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Maidstone, Kent on 29 June 1841 and held the seat until 1853. He was re-elected for Maidstone in the 1852 general election but his election was declared void on petition, and a by-election was held on 22 April 1853. He was one of the Gentlemen of Her Majesty's privy chamber from 1844. Dodd married Georgiana Sanders, daughter of Joseph Sanders. They had one son, George Ashley Dodd, born 29 Sept 1842. In 1865 Thomas Allom was commissioned to design a mausoleum for George Dodd at West Norwood Cemetery. The mausoleum is in the form of a small Gothic chapel with coloured marble, suggesting a north Italian inspiration for the design, and is now a Grade II listed building. It has been suggested that Dodd had bought sixteen houses designed by Thomas Allom in Kensington Park Gardens and wanted his mausoleum to be designed by the same architect."

He started his own draper and silk mercer business in Dundee, and became very wealthy. He married, on 18 November 1823, Hester Eliza Wheeler, who was about 11 years his junior and the daughter of an officer in the Royal Marines. She died 27 May 1834, aged 32, after a childless marriage. He retired soon after, aged 45, from the drapery business. He became a Director of several companies including the Dundee, Perth and London Shipping Company, and the Forfarshire and Perthshire Fire Insurance Company. He built himself a small mansion, \"The Vine\", in Magdelene Yard Road, Dundee. George Duncan was elected to the House of Commons in 1841 as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) being the third Member for Dundee after the 1832 Reform Act. He retired from Parliament in 1857 after serving Dundee for 16 years. He died childless on 6 January 1878 and was buried at the Howff, Dundee."

  "text" : "George Frederick Muntz (26 November 1794 – 30 July 1857) was an industrialist from Birmingham, England and a Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for the Birmingham constituency from 1840 until his death. His family came to England during the French revolution. As an industrialist, he developed Muntz Metal. Muntz was a supporter of political reform and a member of the Birmingham Political Union. In his actions that led to the Reform Act of 1832, he was indicted for sedition as he tried to undermine the Duke of Wellington with a run on gold: To stop the Duke, run for gold. He also was involved in a riot at Saint Martins in Birmingham in protest against the Church Rates which were levied at around 6d to 9d in the pound. He was sent to trial in 1838, but was acquitted on all but one of 13 charges. Whilst claiming to be a republican, his true character appeared to be that of an egotistical aristocrat. Edwards wrote in 1877 of a conversation about a speech he made: \"They won't be able to print Muntz's speech verbatim.\" \"Why not?\" said I. \"Why my dear fellow, no printing office in the world would have capital I's enough\". His home was at Umberslade Hall, in Tanworth in Arden. In the grounds of his estate, Muntz's son commissioned a church to be built which stands to this day, Umberslade Baptist Church. His descendants still live in the area and operate Umberslade Hall Children's Farm. He had seven sons and two daughters. The family business was continued by the eldest son, George Frederick junior together with Philip Albert Muntz, also a Member of Parliament who was created a Baronet in 1902 (see Muntz Baronets). George's brother, Philip Henry Muntz, was also an MP. One son, William Henry Muntz, designed a new type of paddle wheel. The Muntz family are remembered by Muntz Street, a tower block called Muntz House and Muntz Park, all in Birmingham."

Mr Absalom Flavell, of South Kirkby, had been recommended by a number of affiliated bodies for selection as prospective Labour candidate, but he voluntarily withdrew in favour of Mr Griffiths, who had a stronger backing, having been secretary and organiser of the Hemsworth Divisional Labour Party since 1917 when the constituency was created.. Griffiths held the seat at the next two general elections, and died in office in 1945. He was born in North Wales and started work in a coal mine when 13 years of age and was to move to Royston in 1903 where he was employed at the Monckton Colliery to progress to checkweighman. He became delegate for the Monckton Colliery branch to the Yorkshire Miners' Association in 1911 and was also a representative of the Barnsley area on the Miners' Welfare Committee. He also had a long record of public service as a member of the Royston Urban District and Council, being chairman several times.

He first stood for election to the House of Commons at the 1918 general election, when he unsuccessfully contested the Glasgow Springburn constituency for the Labour Party. He won the Springburn seat with a large majority at the 1922 general election, helped by the absence of a Liberal Party candidate. He was re-elected at the next three general elections, but when Labour's vote collapsed at the 1931 general election, Hardie was one of those who lost his seat — by a majority of only 34 votes, the left-wing vote having been divided by the presence of a Communist Party candidate. Hardie was re-elected with a large majority at the 1935 general election, and died in office two years later, aged 63."

Der promovierte Jurist war sowohl Lord Provost von Edinburgh als auch Lord Lieutenant der Stadt und des Countys Edinburgh. In seiner Funktion entwickelte Harrison den Blackford Hill zu einer Parkanlage. Ihm zu Gedenken wurde zwischen 1886 und 1888 ein Harrison Arch genanntes Tor entlang der Observatory Road, einer Zufahrt zu Blackford Hill, erbaut. Den Entwurf für das als Kategorie-B-Bauwerk geschützte Denkmal lieferte der schottische Architekt Sydney Mitchell. Eine oberhalb des Bogens eingelassene Bronzeplakette zeigt das Konterfei Harrisons. 1872 stellte Harrison dem Whitehouse and Grange Bowling Club ein Landstück zur Verfügung und unterstützte damit die Entwicklung des im selben Jahr gegründeten Vereins. Als unabhängiger Liberaler bewarb sich Harrison bei den britischen Unterhauswahlen 1885 um das Mandat des neugeschaffenen Wahlkreises Edinburgh South. Am Wahltag konnte er sich mit einem Stimmenanteil von 59,8 % deutlich gegen seinen Kontrahenten Thomas Raleigh durchsetzen. Harrison verstarb 30 Tage nach den Wahlen. In den Aufzeichnungen des House of Commons sind keine Beiträge seiner Person im Parlament verzeichnet, sodass ungesichert ist, ob er jemals seinen Sitz einnahm. Die durch sein Ableben erforderlich gewordenen Nachwahlen im Wahlkreis am 29. Januar 1886 gewann der Liberale Hugh Childers."

He was elected at the 1945 general election as MP for Rossendale, at the age of 70, becoming one of only a handful of first-time MPs in their seventies.

Walker did not stand again at the 1950 general election, when the Rossendale seat was held for Labour by Anthony Greenwood ."

He held the judicial offices of Sheriff of Inverness-shire 1853-1860 and of Haddington and Berwick 1860-1862. He was appointed Solicitor General for Scotland 1862-1866 and 1868-1869. He then became Lord Advocate. He represented Wigtown Burghs 1865-1874, until he lost an election. After an election petition, that election was declared void and the seat awarded to Young on 28 May 1874. However, in June 1874, he was appointed a Judge of the Court of Session and left Parliament. Briefly in 1874 he was Senator of the College of Justice. He is buried with his wife Janet (d.1901) near the south-west corner of St John's churchyard in Edinburgh."

After the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899, a corps of imperial volunteers from London was formed in late December 1899. The corps included infantry, mounted infantry and artillery divisions and was authorized with the name City of London Imperial Volunteers (CIV). It proceeded to South Africa in the early months of 1900, returned in October the same year, and was disbanded in December 1900. Major McMicking was appointed in charge of Field Battery (the artillery division) of the CIV on 1 January 1900, with the temporary rank of Major in the Army, and left London for South Africa in early February with a contingent of officers and men of the Honourable Artillery Company. He served in command of the artillery division of the CIV until the corps was disbanded. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) for his services in South Africa in 1901.

The son of George Hammond Whalley, Member of Parliament for Peterborough, he was born at the family estate of Plas Madoc in 1851. Educated at Brighton College and on the training ship Britannia, he afterwards entered the Royal Navy. Whalley received a lieutenant's commission in the 6th Royal Lancaster Regiment of Militia on 9 March 1871. He resigned his commission on 1 June 1872, and was commissioned a cornet in the Denbighshire Yeomanry on 29 June 1872. Whalley was promoted lieutenant, then captain on 4 December 1878. In 1879, Whalley commanded C Troop of Lonsdale's Horse, a local colonial unit, in the Anglo-Zulu War. A convoy under his command from Fort Tenedos to Fort Chelmsford successfully beat off a Zulu ambush. Whalley was elected Liberal MP for Peterborough in 1880, like his father (who had occupied the seat until his death in 1878). He resigned by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead in June 1883. He was adjudged bankrupt later that year. In April 1884, Whalley and his wife rented a house in South Kensington. They were evicted in August, after Whalley's draft for the rent had proved uncollectable, but by this time Whalley had broken into a locked room and stolen £200 of the owner's goods and pawned them. He was subsequently convicted of theft at the Old Bailey and sentenced to nine months at hard labor. He subsequently changed his surname to White, and emigrated to Queensland, with his wife and infant daughter, in 1885 or 1886. His later history is unknown."

At the 1924 general election, he was unsuccessful Labour candidate at Bury in Lancashire. At the 1929 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Walthamstow East. He lost the seat two years later, as Labour's vote collapsed in the 1931 election when party split over its leader Ramsay Macdonald's formation of a National Government. Wallace regained his seat in the Labour landslide at the 1945 general election, and held the seat until his defeat at the 1955 general election by the Conservative John Harvey."

He was promoted to Minister of State at the Foreign Office in October 1946, de facto deputy to the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, and appointed a member of the Privy Council. Through his position at the Foreign Office, he was vice-president of the United Nations General Assembly in 1947 and leader of the British delegation to the Economic Commission for Europe, 1948. It was later revealed that his personal assistant and private secrerary at the time, Guy Burgess, was a Soviet agent, although McNeil never came under suspicion.

  "text" : "Hector Morison (1850 – 4 June 1939) was a British stockbroker and Liberal Party politician. He was the son of John Morison of Glasgow, and was educated at the city's academy and university. He joined a Glasgow firm of chartered accountants and stockbrokers, but found his opportunities too limited. Accordingly, in 1879 he moved to London, and in 1886 became a member of the London Stock Exchange. In 1876 Morison had married Josephine Ashton, member of a Manchester family of textile industrialists. He built up an expertise in the textile industry, and was a principal trader in the shares of J & P Coats, the Bradford Dyers Association and the English Sewing Cotton Company. Morison was politically a man of strong Liberal views. He was elected to the Croydon School Board, and was the party's parliamentary candidate at Lewes in 1906 and at Eastbourne in January and December, 1910. In May 1912, Horatio Bottomley, the controversial Liberal MP for Hackney South, was forced to his resign his seat when he was declared bankrupt. Bottomley had been unpopular with a large portion of the party's activists in Hackney, who had run their own candidate against him in December 1910. The two Liberal factions came together to nominate Morison for the vacancy. He was comfortably elected at the by-election held on 24 May. Morison served only one term as a member of the Commons. He chose to retire at the next general election in 1918. Horatio Bottomley, whose bankruptcy had been annulled, regained the Hackney South seat as an independent. Hector Morison played no further part in public life, living in quiet retirement. He died, aged 89, at his home \"Beechcroft\", Kenley, near Croydon, in June 1939."

He was re-elected in 1922 as a National Liberal (as the Coalition Liberals became following the dissolution of the Coalition), but was defeated at the 1923 general election by the Liberal Party candidate Charles Royle. He did not contest the 1924 election, and came third in a closely fought 3-way contest at the 1925 by-election. He was unsuccessful again in 1929, and did not stand in 1931. After the death in July 1935 of Joseph Hunter, the Liberal National MP for Dumfriesshire, Fildes contested the by-election in September, winning the seat with a large majority over his only opponent, the Labour Co-operative candidate. Only a month after the by-election, Parliament was dissolved for the 1935 general election, when Fildes was re-elected by a large majority. He stood down from Parliament at the 1945 general election. He was knighted in 1932."

Henry Usborne was born in Leamington, Warwickshire, educated at Bradfield College and read Engineering at Cambridge. At the 1945 general election, He was elected Member of Parliament for Acocks Green. The constituency was then abolished and in 1950 Usborne was elected in the marginal constituency of Birmingham Yardley. He held the seat until the 1959 general election. According to his obituary in the Times on 19 March 1996, Usborne resigned from the Labour Party in 1962 and joined the Liberals. He urged former colleagues to join Jo Grimond's party as the best hope for defeating the Conservatives. There was a suggestion that Usborne be nominated to stand for the Liberal Party at Cheltenham but he announced that wild horses would not drag him into another Parliamentary contest. In addition to his work as a constituency MP Henry Usborne was one of the main drivers in the British branch of the World Federalist Movement. In 1947, ahead of the foundation of the United Nations, he co-founded the Parliamentary Group for World Government, which as All Party Parliamentary Group for World Governance (APPGWG) counts today (2008) 167 members and meets regularly to provide a forum for debate on global governance issues in the UK Parliament. In 1951 Henry Usborne set up the One World Trust as an independent educational Charity to provide secretarial support to the Group, promote and disseminate knowledge on world governance. In addition to its ongoing support for the APPGWG the One World Trust conducts independent research into the accountability of global organisations, political engagement of citizens at global level, and international law. He died in Evesham aged 86."

  "text" : "Herbert Mellor Gibson (22 February 1896 – 27 March 1954) was a member of the British co-operative movement and a Labour politician. Gibson was the youngest of five children, who was brought up in poverty after his mother was widowed. He first gained employment as an office boy at Manchester Town Hall, and worked for many years in local government. He studied economics and political history at the Co-operative College, Holyoake House. At the 1929 general election he was nominated as the Labour and Co-operative candidate for the Mossley constituency and successfully unseated the sitting MP, Austin Hopkinson. His membership of parliament was short-lived, and Hopkinson regained the seat at the next election in 1931. Gibson continued his involvement with co-operatives, becoming a director of the Co-operative Wholesale Society in 1936, at the same time leaving the employment of the local council. He subsequently held the post of chairman of the English and Scottish Joint Co-operative Society, was a director of the Manchester Ship Canal Company. He was appointed a member of the Joint Industrial Council of the Soap, Candle and Edible Fats Industries and a director of the Colonial Development Corporation."

  "text" : "Horace Evelyn Crawfurd (13 January 1881 – 14 March 1958) was a Liberal Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was a lecturer at Liverpool University. In 1913 he was adopted as Liberal candidate for Southport for a General Election expected to take place in 1914 or 1915. However, the election was postponed due to the war. He became a Flight Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Air Services and was stationed in the Far East. He continued to nurse the Southport constituency while on leave in anticipation of being candidate when the election finally came. However, the Conservative MP for Southport, received endorsement from the Coalition Prime Minister Lloyd George, so the Southport Liberals decided not to run a candidate against him. He unsuccessfully contested the Walthamstow West constituency at the general elections in 1922 and 1923, before winning the seat at the 1924 general election, narrowly defeating the Labour MP Valentine McEntee. During the 1924-29 parliament which was dominated by a Unionist majority, Crawfurd worked closely with a group of radical Liberal MPs that included William Wedgwood Benn, Percy Harris, Joseph Kenworthy and Frank Briant to provide opposition to the government. However, McEntee regained the seat at the 1929 general election. He stood again at the Islington East by-election in February 1931, where he finished fourth. His last candidacy was at the 1935 general election, when he was placed third of the three candidates in Leicester West. In 1930, Elinor Glyn Ltd employed Crawfurd to undertake the publicity campaign for two movies: Knowing Men (1930), which experimented with a new colour process, and The Price of Things (1931). Crawfurd also worked with the author Elinor Glyn on her own personal publicity."

Ian Winterbottom behielt seinen Parlamentssitz bei den 1951 stattgefundenen allgemeinen Wahlen mit einer Mehrheit von nur 139 Stimmen, verlor ihn aber bei der Wahl im Jahre 1955 an den konservativen Kandidaten John Cordeaux. Winterbottom trat 1959 erneut zu den allgemeinen Wahlen in Nottingham Central an, jedoch siegte wiederum Cordeaux, der seinen Sitz mit einer noch breiteren Mehrheit hielt. Ian Winterbottom trat nicht wieder bei den Wahlen 1964 an, als die Labour-Regierung unter Harold Wilson wieder an die Regierung kam. Er wurde jedoch im Jahr 1965 als Baron Winterbottom aus Clopton in der Grafschaft Northampton zum Peer auf Lebenszeit ernannt. Nach dem Labour-Sieg im Jahre 1966 trat er in die Labour-Regierung ein, in der er als Unter-Staatssekretär für die Marine (Royal Navy) bis 1967, als Parlamentarischer Staatssekretär im Ministerium für öffentliche Gebäude und Werke von 1967 bis 1968 und schließlich als Unter-Staatssekretär für die Luftwaffe (Royal Air Force) von 1968 bis zur Niederlage der Labour-Regierung im Jahre 1970 tätig war.

Thomas was born on 22 January 1895, the son of David William Thomas,a self-employed greengrocer of Cwmparc, Rhondda. He was educated at a local elementary school, and in 1908, at 13 years of age, he began working at the Dare colliery, Cwmdare, Aberdare. He attended evening classes in economics and history in order to improve his education, and in 1918 he joined the Labour Party. In 1922 he was promoted to the position of checkweighman at Cwm-parc. He was a prominent figure within the South Wales Miners' Federation and the National Union of Mineworkers for more than 30 years and held a number of offices in the Park and Dare Lodge, the largest in the south Wales coalfield. During the 1926 coalminers' strike Thomas was sentenced to three months imprisonment as the chairman of the Park and Dare Lodge as a result of his involvement in industrial disturbances. He was elected a member of the Rhondda Borough Council in 1928, chaired many of its committees and served as its chairman in 1938-39. He remained a member until 1951. He served, too, on a number of joint industrial councils for Wales and Monmouthshire, and was a member of the South Wales Electricity Board, 1947-49. In 1950 he was elected for Rhondda West and continued to represent the constituency until his death in 1966. He was much interested in economic and industrial matters. Thomas was a consistent opponent of Welsh nationalism and fought relentlessly against the Parliament for Wales agitation of the 1950s. He publicly attacked Plaid Cymru on several occasions and in October 1965 he was highly critical of the recommendations of the Hughes-Parry Report on the Legal Status of the Welsh Language. In 1960 he supported the Conservative government's measure to open public houses on Sundays. He married in October 1920 Annie Mary, daughter of D.J. Davies. She, too, was active in the Labour politics of the area. She died in July 1956. They had one son and one daughter. Thomas died on 3 December 1966 at his home 94 Park Road, Cwmparc, Rhondda."

Having graduated from the London School of Economics and completed National Service in the Royal Air Force, he trained as a Church of England priest and was ordained in 1958. In order to stand for Parliament in 1974, he had to renounce his orders. At the February 1974 general election, Clemitson was elected as Member of Parliament for Luton East. He lived in the constituency and held his seat at the October 1974 election but, at the 1979 general election, lost by 847 votes to the Conservative Graham Bright. He moved to France with his wife (Janet) and daughter (Suzannah) in the late 1990s and died at his home there, aged 66, just before Christmas 1997. Following his death, his sister, Jean, persuaded the General Synod of the Church of England to permit a stained glass window to be installed in his memory at St Mary's Church in Harlington, Bedfordshire, the village where they had lived for some time during childhood. The window, designed by Petri Anderson, was dedicated in May 2009. Clemitson co-wrote \"A Life to Live: Beyond Full Employment\" (Junction Books, 1981) with George Rogers MP. Clemitson House, a municipal building in the centre of Luton, is named in memory of Clemitson and his father (Daniel), who had served as an alderman on the local council. Clemitson was a lifelong supporter of Luton Town Football Club."

He bought a share of the Buchan Observer and became its editor for about six years. Thereafter, he edited several newspapers in North East England: from 1874 to 1877 he edited the Newcastle Daily Chronicle, from 1877 to 1885 the South Shields Gazette, and finally from 1885 to 1895 was editor of the Northern Weekly Leader. After an unsuccessful bid for a parliamentary seat in Tynemouth in 1892, he was elected at the general election in January 1906 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Aberdeenshire. He died in London sixteen days later, before he had an opportunity to take his seat, thus becoming one of the shortest-serving MPs in history. His brother, Robert Cumming Annand, was also involved in the newspaper industry. James Annand was briefly married to Mary Hannah Burt in 1899 until her death in 1900."

Barr was Member of Parliament (MP) for Motherwell, from 1924 to 1931 and then for Coatbridge from 1935 to 1945. He was Chairman of the Select Committee on Capital Punishment, 1929–1930 which reported at the end of the latter year. In 1930-1931 he was Chairman of the Liaison Committee, as the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party was then known at any time when the party was in government. A Presbyterian minister, Barr strongly opposed any link between Church and State; in his view, the Church must support and maintain itself on an entirely voluntary basis. For this reason, he was a prominent member of the United Free Church of Scotland and he led the opposition to that group's reunion with the Church of Scotland in 1929; he and those of like mind did not participate in the re-union and continued as the United Free Church of Scotland, which is still in existence. His maiden speech as an MP was an attack on the Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925 and lasted just under an hour and a half. Barr was the grandfather of James Barr (biblical scholar)."

He became involved in trade union activities, leading to his sacking on three occasions. He subsequently moved to the town of Oldham, becoming secretary of the Oldham Weavers' Association in 1905, a post he held for 41 years. He was the first president of the Oldham Labour Party, and attempted to gain election to the Borough Council without success. In 1918 he was elected as member of parliament for Ormskirk, the first non Conservative to be elected for this seat since its creation in 1885. This was principally due to a divided Conservative vote between the Coalition Conservatives and the candidate of the National Farmers Union. Bell served only one term in parliament, losing his seat at the next election in 1922. He continued his union activities: in 1924 he was appointed secretary of the International Federation of Textile Workers' Associations, and was subsequently secretary of the United Textile Factory Workers Association, and in 1930 took part in a trade mission to China. He died, aged 83, in an Oldham hospital in 1955."

At the time he was managing director of a boot manufacturing business. Blindell overturned a Conservative majority of nearly 5,000 to win with a majority of 3,706. His victory was the last Liberal by-election gain until Torrington in 1958. Blindell was re-elected as a Liberal at the 1929 general election, but in 1931 he was one of the Liberal MPs who broke with their party to support Ramsay MacDonald's National Government, eventually forming the National Liberal Party. He was re-elected as a National Liberal at the 1931 general election and at the 1935 general election. In both elections, the Conservatives (who also supported the National Government) did not field a candidate against him, and he was returned with large majorities. Blindell was knighted in 1936, and died in office in 1937. At the consequent Holland with Boston by-election, 1937, Herbert Butcher held the seat for the National Liberals."

His eldest brother William was MP for Beverley, Carlisle and East Cumberland and his next eldest brother, John, was an earlier MP for Leeds. The fourth brother, Henry Cowper, was Mayor of Leeds in 1842-1843. Marshall bought the Monk Coniston estate, near Coniston, Cumbria, from the Knott family in 1835. He later created the celebrated landscape of Tarn Hows by constructing a dam to merge three existing small tarns into the present body of water, at the same time supplying water power to his sawmill in Yewdale. The estate was later bought by Beatrix Potter and eventually passed to the National Trust. James Garth Marshall wrote a pamphlet entitled Minorities and Majorities; Their Relative Rights. A Letter to Lord John Russell, M.P. on Parliamentary Reform."

He made his fortune through tin mines, mostly from the Wheal Reeth mine, but also from the St. Ives Consols mine. He used the Consols mine to create a political base for himself, by building the village of Halsetown to accommodate the mine-workers. The village was within the boundaries of the parliamentary borough of St Ives, allowing Halse patronage of the borough's two seats in Parliament. At the 1820 general election, both seats were taken by Halse's supporters, but his rival the borough-monger Sir Christopher Hawkins pursued him with charges of bribery, and at the 1826 election both Hawkins and Halse were elected. He was defeated at the 1830 election by William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley, nephew of the Duke of Wellington, but regained the seat in 1831 and held it until his death. In 1835, he was blackballed by the recently created St. Ives Library and Institution."

He was instrumental in obtaining the municipal franchise of Manchester as a borough in 1838, and was its Mayor between 1842-3, and later became the MP for Stockport from 1847 until his death. He died at his home in Streatham, and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery where his ornate Gothic tomb by Alfred Waterhouse (architect of the Natural History Museum, London and Manchester Town Hall) is listed Grade II, and in such poor condition as to be on the English Heritage at risk register. There is currently no plan from Lambeth council to improve the situation."

He moved to Hammersmith in West London, where he became a member of the borough council in 1919. He was also an official in the National Furnishing Trades Association. In 1922 he was chosen by the Labour Party to contest the Conservative-held seat of Hammersmith North. He failed to be elected on that occasion, but when another election was held in the following year he was elected MP for North Hammersmith by the narrow margin of 845 votes. He was unseated after less than a year when a further election was held in October 1924. In 1926, Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, the MP for Hammersmith North, resigned. In the resulting by-election, held against the background of the General Strike, Gardner regained the seat with the substantial majority of 3,611 votes. He retained the seat at the 1929 general election. Following the election the Labour Party formed a minority government. This was subsequently replaced by a National Government in August 1931 leading to a split in the Labour Party. At the election held in October 1931 Gardner, like most Labour MPs opposing the government, was defeated. Gardner did not return to parliamentary politics after his 1931 defeat, but was a member of the Hammersmith council until his death."

Sexton was born in Newcastle upon Tyne to an Irish-born family of market traders, who soon moved to St Helens, Lancashire. After leaving school he worked in a variety of jobs, including as a seaman and in a chemical factory, before becoming a docker on Liverpool Docks. In 1884 he set up his own business as a coal merchant. In 1889 he joined the new National Union of Dock Labourers (later National Union of Dock, Riverside and General Workers) and was elected General Secretary in 1893, defeating James Larkin. He held this post until the union joined the Transport and General Workers' Union in 1922, whereupon he became National Supervisor of the Docks Trade Group of the new union. He retired from the TGWU in 1928. A founder member of the Independent Labour Party, he later joined the Labour Party. He stood unsuccessfully for Liverpool Toxteth in 1905 and then served as Labour Member of Parliament for St Helens from 1918 to 1931. He also sat on Liverpool City Council from 1905 until his death. Up to 1930 Sexton was elected for the St Anne's ward then was replaced by Bessie Braddock before becoming an alderman. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1917 and knighted in 1931. In 1934 he was granted the freedom of the City of Liverpool."

He served successively as parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Defence Minister Gerry Reynolds and Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart, and was also a junior defence minister in the Callaghan government. In 1981, he was among the Labour MPs who defected to the Social Democratic Party. At the 1983 general election, he lost his seat by just 920 votes to the Conservative David Evennett. After his defection, he was referred to as \"the inappropriately named Wellbeloved\" by then Labour leader Michael Foot. Wellbeloved subsequently rejoined the Labour Party as a member.

He was born the third of four surviving children to James Williamson Snr, who had established a successful coated fabrics business in the town in the 1840s. James jnr was educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School and worked all his life in the family business. With his father he created the city's Williamson Park, on the site of former stone quarries on Lancaster moor. After the death of his second wife, Jessie, who supported him in his political life, he built the Ashton Memorial on a hill in the park; the Edwardian baroque building is now used for exhibitions and for weddings. He also donated the city's Town Hall and a monument to Queen Victoria in the city's Dalton Square. He bought Ashton Hall in 1884, serving as High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1885. In the 1886 general election, Williamson was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Lancaster, and held his seat at the 1892 election. In 1895 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Ashton, of Ashton in the County Palatine of Lancaster and in 1920 made Constable of Lancaster Castle for life. He married three times; firstly to Margaret Gatey in 1869, with whom he had two daughters, secondly to Jessie Hulme in 1880 and thirdly to Florence Whalley, later Lady Ashton, in 1909, who survived him. His elder daughter Maud died unmarried at the age of 30 and his younger daughter Ella married Viscount Peel in 1899."

Dubbed \"Stalin's Granny\" owing to her left-wing views, Maynard was a leading activist in the National Union of Agricultural Workers becoming vice-president of the union and being narrowly beaten to its presidency. She joined the Labour Party in 1946 and served as a councillor on North Yorkshire County Council. She was elected to Labour's National Executive Committee 1972–82 and 1983–87, and was Vice-Chair of the Labour Party 1980–81. She was appointed a Justice of the Peace at Thirsk in 1950. Having acted as Labour agent in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, Maynard was elected in 1974 as MP for Sheffield Brightside and held the seat until she retired in 1987. Throughout her political career Maynard advocated policies on the left of the Labour Party and chaired the left-wing Campaign Group. She served on the Agriculture Select Committee 1975–87. She played a leading role in securing the passage of the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 which regulated the tied cottage system that had caused misery to rural workers. Maynard died of cancer in Sowerby, North Yorkshire on 27 March 1998, the same day as fellow former MP, Joan Lestor. Her remains are buried alongside her immediate family at Thornton-le-Street."

  "text" : "John William Banfield J.P., M.P. (August 1875 – 25 May 1945) was a British trade unionist and Labour Party politician, who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Wednesbury from 1932 until his death in 1945. Banfield was General Secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers from 1915 until he retired in 1940.He unsuccessfully contested the 1918 general election in Birmingham Aston. He was a government delegate representing the work people at Geneva from 1924 to 1925. He was unsuccessful in Fulham West at a by-election in 1930 and at the 1931 general election. In 1932, the Conservative MP for Wednesbury, Viscount Ednam succeeded to the peerage as Earl of Dudley, triggering a by-election in July 1932. Banfield was selected as Labour's candidate, hoping to regain a seat which had been held by Labour from 1918 to 1931.After a campaign focusing on the means test for unemployment benefit (in a constituency with 12,000 unemployed), Banfield won the Wednesbury 1932 by-election. He was re-elected at the 1935 general election. In December 1936, he delivered an address, 'Sunday: An M.P.'s Convictions' at the Alliance Birthday Celebrations of the Imperial Alliance for the Defence of Sunday, arguing that Sunday should be a day of rest and worship. In June 1937 he made a speech in Parliament, proposing the addition of a clause to the Factories Bill: Prohibition of night work in bakehouses. His campaigning led to him being known as \"the bakers' MP\". Banfield died aged 69, in Hammersmith, London of a heart attack shortly before the 1945 general election."

  "text" : "John Buckle (1867 – 8 November 1925) was a British trade unionist and Labour Party politician. Buckle was an official in the National Union of Shoe and Boot Operatives, and was the first Labour alderman on Leeds City Council. In 1908 he was one of three members of the union who were nominated as parliamentary candidates. In the event he did not in fact contest an election until 1922. By 1915 he had become president of the Shoe and Boot Operatives. By 1919 he had moved to Leicester. In that year he was appointed by the Minister of Labour to the Trade Board for the Shoe and Boot Repairing Trade as a workers' representative. In 1922 he was the travelling organiser for his union and the society's principal negotiator. In the general election of 1922 he was elected to the Commons as member of parliament for the Eccles Division of Lancashire, unseating the Conservative incumbent, Marshall Stevens. He held the seat when a further election was held in 1923. Although his total number of votes fell from 14,354 to 12,227 he was able to increase his majority over Stevens from 1,803 to 1,863 with the anti-Labour vote split by the presence of a Liberal Party candidate. A minority Labour government that was formed following the election collapsed in October 1924, necessitating a further general election. Although he managed to increase his vote, Buckle was defeated in a straight fight by the Conservative candidate Albert Bethel by over 2,000 votes. He died in the following year."

The family was Nonconformist in religion and Liberal in politics. John Cheetham served as MP for South Lancashire and later Salford. During the Lancashire Cotton Famine in 1861-4, Cheetham rose to prominence as President of the Cotton Supply Association: a body that aimed to promote the growth and export of raw cotton outside the US and particularly in the British Raj. As the US cotton supply returned however, Cheetham's frequent attacks on the governance of the Raj gradually caused opinion in Britain and India to turn against the Association, and it dissolved in 1872. His son John Frederick Cheetham was MP for North Derbyshire and later for Stalybridge."

  "text" : "John Cranch Walker Vivian (18 April 1818 – 22 January 1879) was an English Liberal politician from the Vivian family who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1841 and 1871. Vivian was the second son of the Lieutenant-general Sir Richard Hussey Vivian and his first wife Eliza De Crespigny, daughter of Philip Campion De Crespigny. Born at the Château de Rosamel in Frencq, France, he was educated at Eton College and joined the 11th Hussars as cornet in February 1836. He became a lieutenant in December 1837, captain in April 1840 and retired in 1842. Vivian was a Deputy Lieutenant and JP for Cornwall. Vivian was elected Member of Parliament for Penryn and Falmouth in July 1841 and held the seat until July 1847. He was elected MP for Bodmin in April 1857 and held the seat until May 1859, when he stood unsuccessfully at Truro. At the 1865 general election he was elected Member of Parliament for Truro and he held the seat until 1871. He was appointed a Lord of the Treasury in December 1868, holding office until 1870 when he was appointed Financial Secretary to the War Office. He held that office until 1871 when he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for War, thereby vacating his seat. Vivian died at the age of 60 at his home at The Priory, Richmond, London leaving a personal estate of less than £1,000 to his widow. Vivian married firstly in 1840 Louisa Woodgate, daughter of Henry Woodgate. She died in 1855 and he married secondly in 1861 Florence Grosvenor Rowley, daughter of Major Rowley of the Bombay Cavalry. They were divorced in August 1869 after she eloped with the Marquess of Waterford."

At the 1918 general election, he was elected as MP for the new Smethwick constituency on the outskirts of Birmingham. It was an unusual electoral contest: there was no Conservative Party or Liberal Party candidate, and his only opponent was Christabel Pankhurst of the Women's Party, who was supported by the alliance of the Conservative Party and the David Lloyd George-led Coalition Liberal faction. Davison won the seat with a majority of only 775 votes, and was returned to the House of Commons at the 1922 general election with a margin of only 382 votes over his only opponent, a Conservative. He was re-elected by more comfortable margins at the 1923 general election and at the 1924 general election, but resigned his seat in 1926. The resulting by-election on 21 December 1926, was won by the Labour candidate Oswald Mosley, who went on to found the New Party and the British Union of Fascists. Davison died in March 1927, aged 56."

  "text" : "John Edward Sutton (23 December 1862 - 29 November 1945) was a British trades unionist and Labour Party politician. At the age of 14, Sutton took up employment at Bradford Colliery, Manchester. He became a check-weighman and secretary of the Bradford branch of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation. In 1894 he was elected to Manchester City Council as an Independent Labour Party councillor for the Bradford ward, an area previously represented by Conservatives. At the general election of January 1910 Sutton was elected as Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester East, the constituency that included the Bradford area. He held the seat until its abolition in 1918. At the 1918 general election Sutton stood in the new seat of Manchester Clayton, losing to the Conservative, Edward Hopkinson. Hopkinson died in 1922, forcing a by-election, and Sutton was selected as Labour candidate. The Coalition Government was very unpopular due to high unemployment and severe cutbacks recommended by the Geddes Report, and Sutton easily won the seat. He held the seat at subsequent general elections until 1931 when a large swing to the Conservatives was reflected in Clayton. William Flanagan, Sutton's opponent in the 1922 by-election took the seat. Sutton did not contest another parliamentary election."

  "text" : "John Evans (10 September 1875 – 18 April 1961) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Ogmore at a by-election in 1946, but stood down at the 1950 general election. John Evans, a fluent Welsh speaker, was elected MP for Ogmore in 1946, following a by-election, caused by the resignation of Ted Williams who had been appointed as high commissioner to Australia. It was said by many that at 70 years of age he was too old for the job but it is well to remember that Winston Churchill became prime minister for the second time at 76 and remained an MP into his eighties. John Evans was born at Cwmparc in the Rhondda Valley in September 1875 and attended the local Park Board School. He started work at twelve years of age in the local colliery where he remained for the next 20 years before winning a place at Ruskin College. On his return he became union secretary at Coegnant colliery, Maesteg. By now he was living at Nantyffyllon. He was elected to Maesteg UDC (1916–37) and Glamorgan CC in (1913–46). In 1929 he stood unsuccessfully for parliament in Montgomery and in 1931 he failed to get the nomination for Ogmore losing out to Ted Williams.Surprisingly, as the sitting MP, he failed to gain the nomination, from the Ogmore Labour Party, for the 1950 General Election, despite being steeped in mining tradition and Welsh Culture. Newcomer Walter Padley gained the nomination and went on to be the MP for the next 30 years. Shortly after his non-selection, John Evans moved to Tongwynlais near Cardiff and from there won a seat on Glamorgan CC in 1952, at the grand age of 75. He died in 1961, aged 85."

At the 1868 general election, there was no Conservative candidate in Grismby. However Fildes was opposed by the Liberal George Tomline, who was described by The Times as a \"formidable opponent\".

  "text" : "John Golding (9 March 1931 – 20 January 1999) was a Labour Party politician and Trade Union leader in the United Kingdom. He was educated at Chester City Grammar School, Keele University and the London School of Economics. After some time working in the Civil Service he took up a research job with the Post Office Engineering Union. Golding was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme at a by-election in 1969. He served in the governments of Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan, as PPS to Eric Varley as Minister of Technology, a Labour whip in opposition, and Minister for Employment. He was an outspoken opponent of Labour left-wingers such as Tony Benn and Eric Heffer, whom he regarded as idle dreamers out of touch with the working-class. Golding was a key figure in opposing the entryist Militant group, and especially in mobilising moderate trades union leaders to exercise their block votes to achieve this end. After he died, his writings were published under the title Hammer of the Left: My Part in Defeating the Labour Left by John Golding and Paul Farrelly (see below). In 1986 he left Parliament (by applying for the Chiltern Hundreds) to take up the post of General Secretary of the National Communications Union. He held this post until 1988. He had served as a member of the council of the Trades Union Congress. After he vacated the Newcastle-under-Lyme seat, the resulting by-election was won by his wife Llin, who held the seat until 2001; her successor in the seat was Paul Farrelly. John Golding's most unusual claim to fame is that he once made a speech in committee lasting eleven hours and fifteen minutes. It nominally concerned a small amendment to the bill to privatise British Telecom. This filibuster was instrumental in delaying the privatisation until after the 1983 general election, but with Margaret Thatcher obtaining a massive parliamentary majority the privatisation was soon forced through. Changes in British parliamentary procedure mean that Golding's record is unlikely ever to be beaten."

He served in the 2nd Life Guards, rising to the rank of commissioned cornet in 1847, lieutenant in 1849 and captain in 1854. In 1856 he was appointed major in the Queen’s Own Royal Glasgow and Lower Ward of Lanarkshire Yeomanry Cavalry. Although retiring from the regular Army in 1860, he continued to serve in the Yeomanry until 1885. He began his political career in 1857 as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Falkirk Burghs, serving for two years. He later sat for Lanarkshire South in 1868–74 and 1880–86. He also served as a Justice of the Peace, and as Deputy Lieutenant and Vice-Lord Lieutenant for Lanarkshire. In 1886, Hamilton was raised to the peerage as Baron Hamilton of Dalzell. He served in William Ewart Gladstone's government as a Lord-in-Waiting from 1892 to 1894. The Hamiltons made large amounts of money in the nineteenth century, as the lands they held in Lanarkshire were sold for coal exploitation. In the late 1850s and 1860s Hamilton was able to greatly extend his home of Dalzell House, a former tower house outside Motherwell, laying out landscaped grounds at the same time. In 1864 he married Lady Emily Leslie-Melville (died 1882), daughter of David Leslie-Melville, 8th Earl of Leven, and had issue: 1."

However, the anticipated general election was delayed until 1918 due to the First World War. At the 1918 general election he unsuccessfully contested Bradford North. He was also defeated in 1923 at Tynemouth. He finally succeeded in being elected to the Commons at the 1924 general election, when he was returned as member of parliament for Newcastle upon Tyne West. He held the seat in 1929, but was defeated when there was a large swing against Labour in 1931. He was Lord Mayor of Bradford in 1924 - 1925."

The captain and several of the crew of the 'Alabama', after its engagement with the 'Kearage', off Cherbourg, in 1864, were rescued by Mr. LANCASTER, who, to save them, exposed his yacht to the fire of the Federal war-steamer.\" This recalls the last great sea battle of the American Civil War between the confederate ship Alabama and the union ship Kearsarge. Lancaster married Euphemia Gibson daughter of D. Gibson of Renfrewshire in 1841."

He was educated at Sharp's Institution, Perth and entered the Inland Revenue in 1866. In 1870 he gained a Board of Inland Revenue scholarship in Science and studied at the Royal School of Mines winning 1st class prize in Organic and Inorganic Chemistry. He was a chemist in the Inland Revenue Laboratory at Somerset House from 1870 to 1874 and then became an instructor in the Chemical Research Laboratory at the Royal School of Mines. In 1879 he began in business as an assayer and mining expert. At the 1885 general election, Cameron was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wick Burghs as an independent liberal, defeating the sitting Liberal MP John Pender. A committed land reformer, he had been nominated by the Wick Radical Workingmen's Association and supported by the Highland Law Reform Association and appears to have been sympathetic to the Crofters Party. He served as a Liberal Party MP and held the seat until his defeat at the 1892 general election by Pender, who was by then a Liberal Unionist."

Massie was first elected as a Councillor to Leamington Borough Council in 1878. He was then appointed by the council as an alderman and served until 1887. In 1894 he was elected a member of the Executive of the National Liberal Federation. He sat on that body until he was elected to parliament. Despite not having a financial background he served as national Liberal Party Treasurer from 1903–06. He was a committed supporter of Disestablishmentarianism and was President of the Liberation Society which campaigned for the removal of state patronage and control from schools. He opposed the Unionist Government's Education Act 1902. In protest against the act he passively resisted paying the local education rate. He was elected to the House of Commons at the general election in 1906, but was defeated at the January 1910 general election by the Liberal Unionist candidate Thomas Calley. Massie did not stand for Parliament again. In 1910 he was re-elected to the executive of the National Liberal Federation and sat on that body until his death."

After leaving school at 13 he became a printer's devil in what is now the Aberdeen Press and Journal. He then became a barber, running his own establishment until the war years. His socialist views repelled his wealthy customers and the shop failed soon after the war. Moving to Glasgow, he worked as a journeyman barber before becoming a full-time political organizer for the Independent Labour Party. he married Jessie Thomson of Springburn, Glasgow and they had a son, John. He moved to London to become the editor of the New Leader. He was General Secretary of the Independent Labour Party from 1927 to 1933.He was elected at the 1945 general election as MP for the two-seat Norwich constituency. When that constituency was divided at the 1950 general election, he was returned to the House of Commons for the new Norwich North seat, which he held until he retired at the 1964 general election.

  "text" : "John Samuel Potts (12 August 1861 – 28 April 1938) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom who served a Member of Parliament (MP) for twelve years between 1922 and 1938. Born in Bolton, Lancashire, Potts had started work at Durham Colliery at the age of eleven. He was a checkweighman at the Hemsworth Colliery, Yorkshire, for 25 years. At the Barnsley by-election of 1897 Potts supported the Liberal Party-candidate Joseph Walton. While chairing a Liberal election meeting during this by-election, Potts said in the presence of Walton that he would favour a labour party at a time when state payment of MPs, and of official election expenses would enable working men to be maintained in Parliament. But until then, \"the Liberal party was the working man’s only hope\". In 1905, Potts switched sides, and started working with the Independent Labour Party against Walton, and the leadership of the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA). Ten years later Potts was elected as treasurer of the YMA, and became a member of the executive committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. He kept these positions until he was elected as MP for Barnsley at the 1922 general election, when payment of MPs and election expenses had been enacted. Potts held the seat at three further elections in the 1920s. When Labour split at the 1931 general election over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of a National Government, he narrowly lost his seat to the National Liberal candidate Richard John Soper. Potts was comfortably re-elected at the 1935 general election, but died in office in 1938, in Barnsley, aged 76. His illness and death have been connected with the shock he received when the Wharncliffe Woodmoor Pit Disaster occurred two years earlier. His home was in the lane which led to the colliery."

He served as a councillor on Lanarkshire County Council and Motherwell and Wishaw Council from 1946. At the 1951 general election Robertson stood as the Labour candidate in the marginal Conservative-held seat of Glasgow Scotstoun, losing by 625 votes. He was elected to the House of Commons ten years later at the 1961 by-election in the Paisley constituency, following the appointment of sitting MP Douglas Johnston as a judge in the Court of Session. He was re-elected at five subsequent general elections, sitting as a Labour MP until 1976, and for the SLP between 1976 and 1979. He did not contest the 1979 general election. On 18 January 1976 Robertson, along with another Labour MP, Jim Sillars and Labour's senior Scottish researcher, Alex Neil, officially established the Scottish Labour Party (SLP).The formation of the SLP was prompted as a left-wing split from the mainstream Labour Party over distrust about how strong the then Labour government's stated commitment to Scottish devolution was in reality. Robertson was a leading figure in the SLP, along with Sillars, but unlike Sillars he stood down at the 1979 general election, deciding not to contest his Paisley seat. The Scottish Labour Party was officially disbanded in 1981, after failing to win any seats at the 1979 general election."

In 1885, he was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Montrose Burghs, a position he was re-elected to in 1886, 1892, and 1895. He was a strong supporter of William Ewart Gladstone, and resigned his seat on 5 February 1896 by taking the post of Steward of the Manor of Northstead so that John Morley could be re-elected after a defeat in Newcastle-upon-Tyne."

He was sent to England in 1833 to a school in Liverpool. He also studied Hebrew as he wanted to become a rabbi, but he entered the law instead. He graduated from the University of London in 1841 and was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1842. He went to Jamaica after his marriage in 1843 and practised law briefly at Spanish Town until returning to England later in 1843 for his wife's health. He became successful on the Northern Circuit, and in the superior courts in London and in 1864 he was created a sergeant at law. He was frequently a judge in Manchester and Liverpool, and at the City of London Court. He became QC in 1868. Simon was elected as MP for Dewsbury in 1868 and held the seat until he retired through ill health in 1888. In parliament he was particularly concerned with reforms of the judicature, and outside parliament was active in campaigning on behalf of Russian Jews. He died in 1897 aged 78."

In 1885 he was appointed as a director of the Suez Canal Company. He made his home at Hopefield, Pendleton. In 1880 he was elected as one of Manchester's three members of parliament. The Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 divided the Manchester constituency into six divisions, and Slagg stood as the Liberal candidate at Manchester North West, but was defeated. He returned to the Commons at a bi-election in 1887 at Burnley. In 1866 he married Katherine German of Sevenoaks, Kent. John Slagg died at his Mayfair, London home in May 1889, aged 47."

  "text" : "John Vincent Tilley (13 June 1941—18 December 2005) was a British Labour politician. Tilley was born and raised in Derby. He was educated at a grammar school before going on to Cambridge University where he read History at Trinity Hall. He then became a journalist at the Newcastle Journal, before moving to London as industrial, and later diplomatic, correspondent of the Scotsman. In 1971, Tilley was elected to Wandsworth Council, where he became council leader. He was selected as Labour candidate to fight Kensington in the February 1974 and October 1974 elections, with improving results but no success. The party chose him to defend at a by-election its long-standing high majority in Lambeth Central in 1978, which he won. The election was triggered by a caused by a Labour MP's death, Marcus Lipton. In Parliament, he served on Labour's opposition front bench, resigning in 1982 in opposition to the Party leadership's stand on the Falklands War. As MP for the Brixton area, he worked with Lord Scarman after the 1981 Brixton Riots for a better understanding of local social problems. He proposed a bill to amend the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 to make rape in marriage illegal in 1983. Tilley was a founding member of the Socialist Campaign Group in 1982, but his constituency seat was abolished for the 1983 election and he was selected to fight Southwark and Bermondsey instead. The seat had been safe Labour but Simon Hughes had won the constituency for the Liberal Party in a by-election earlier that year, and Hughes kept the seat in the general election. Tilley never returned to Parliament. Tilley subsequently worked as chief economic adviser to the London Borough of Hackney and 11 years as parliamentary secretary to the Co-operative Union. From 2000 to 2002, he headed the parliamentary office of the Co-operative Group. An active co-operator, he wrote Churchill's Favourite Socialist: A Life of AV Alexander, a biography of an earlier co-operative activist and Member of Parliament, created a peer for his life work, A. V. Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Hillsborough. Tilley's first marriage ended in divorce, after a daughter, Cleo. He married again in 1982 to Kathryn Riley, a Brixton teacher and Labour activist, later professor at the University of London's Institute of Education. They had a daughter Jo. Tilley died of cancer in 2005."

Townshend was the son of John Townshend, 4th Marquess Townshend, and Elizabeth Jane Crichton-Stuart. The soldier George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend, was his paternal great-grandfather, and Prime Minister John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, was his maternal great-grandfather. He was elected to the House of Commons for Tamworth in 1855 (succeeding his father), a seat he held until 1863, when he inherited the marquessate on his father's death and entered the House of Lords. At the Salisbury Petty Sessions in May 1881, Lord Edward Thynne described how he had been accosted by Lord Townshend and two accomplices on the road between Laverstock and Salisbury. A Colonel Nepean held the pony's head while Townshend struck him several times with the handle of a horse whip. Thynne acknowledged having eloped with Lady Townshend in 1872, but noted that the Marquis had never sued for divorce, and alleged that Lord Macduff had attacked him over the same matter while he was abroad. Townshend was convicted of the assault, and sentenced to a fine of £500 or three months in prison. After some hours in jail, he reluctantly paid the fine, equivalent to £45,500 in 2017. Townshend denounced the court, while Vanity Fair reported unnamed others as saying \"the only regret is that he [Thynne] was not thrashed earlier and worse\". Lord Townshend married Lady Anne Elizabeth Clementina Duff, daughter of James Duff, 5th Earl Fife, on 17 October 1865. Their children included:"

  "text" : "Joseph Bliss (1853 – 12 December 1939) was a British Liberal Party politician. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Cockermouth at an unopposed by-election in March 1916, following the resignation of the Liberal MP Sir Wilfrid Lawson. He had previously stood unsuccessfully in the North Lonsdale at the general elections in January 1910 and December 1910, losing narrowly both occasions. In January 1910, Bliss's campaign team asked for recount after the vote was declared, but were told that the ballot boxes had already been sealed and sent by train to London. He lodged a petition, which claimed that invalid votes for Haddock had been allowed while valid votes for Bliss had been disallowed. The petition was heard in the King's Bench Division of the High Court, before Justice Lawrence and Justice Phillimore. They allowed a recount, in which the Conservative George Haddock's majority was increased to 169 votes (2.0%), and Bliss was required to pay the costs of the hearing. The Cockermouth constituency was abolished at the 1918 general election, when Bliss was one of two sitting MPs who contested the new Lonsdale constituency. The Coalition Coupon went to his Conservative opponent Claude Lowther, who won the seat. Bliss did not stand for Parliament again."

  "text" : "Sir Joseph Dodge Weston (1822–- 5 Mar 1895) was an English merchant and shipping magnate and Liberal politician who was active in local government and sat in the House of Commons in two periods between 1885 and 1895. Weston was born in Kingsdown, Bristol, the son of Thomas Weston and his wife Mary Tuck. His father was a wealthy iron merchant at Redcliffe. He joined the family firm and developed the business to take in iron foundries, cotton manufacture and railway wagon and carriage building. He was one of the original promoters and founders of the Bristol Waggon Works and was chairman of the Patent Nut and Bolt Co. His shipping interests thrived in the time of emigration to Australia. Weston took an interest in politics and became a city councillor for Bristol in 1868, serving on the council until 1892. He was interested in public libraries, and after Bristol adopted the Public Libraries Act in 1874 he was behind the building of its first branch library at St Philips in 1876 and put some of his own money into it. He presided over Bristol's purchase and development of the Portishead and Avonmouth docks. He was mayor of Bristol for four years from 1880 to 1884. He was a J.P. for Bristol and received a knighthood. In 1885, Weston was elected MP for Bristol South, but lost the seat in 1886. In 1890 he became MP for Bristol East – a large working class constituency. He was a liberal of advanced views and in favour of Home Rule. and it was commented that “He might be a socialist if Socialism were more respectable and not so dreadfully lowering”!. Weston died at the age of 72 and was buried Arnos Vale Cemetery."

  "text" : "Joseph Lynn Leicester (24 December 1825 – 13 October 1903) was an English glass blower and Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1886. Born in Warrington, he was the son of Thomas Leicester, a glassblower. At the age of nine, Leicester was apprenticed to his father's trade. In 1850 he moved to Lambeth in London, and was employed for 35 years as a glass-blower by James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars, London. Soon after his arrival in the capital he was appointed secretary of the Glassmakers Trade Society, a position he held for more than forty years. He was sent by the Society of Arts to report upon glass at the Paris Exhibitions in 1867 and 1868. The Society awarded him three first-class prizes for art and in 1870 the Glass Blowers' Society of Great Britain and Ireland presented him with £100 in recognition of his services to the trade. He was a strong temperance advocate, and was in favour of Sunday closing of public houses. In the 1885 general election, Leicester was elected Member of Parliament for West Ham South but in the 1886 general election, he was defeated by the Conservative candidate. He made four contributions during his year in parliament. At the 1892 general election he was again chosen to contest the West Ham South seat for the Liberals. However, the party withdrew from the constituency, in favour of Keir Hardie of the Independent Labour Party, who went on to win the seat. Leicester died at the age of 77 and was buried in Nunhead Cemetery. His gravestone noted: \"From a poor working lad he became an eloquent advocate of temperance, a master craftsman in the art of glass making, and all his life took a foremost part in the social elevation of his fellow workmen, who did honour to themselves and him, by returning him as a Member of Parliament\"\"Write him down as one who loved his fellow man\""

He was elected Member of Parliament for Newcastle East in the 1922 General Election, but died a month later. For many years Bell was General Secretary of the National Amalgamated Union of Labour. He was first selected in 1914 as Labour candidate for Leith Burghs to contest the by-election when he came third. In 1918 he was selected for the Edinburgh seat of Leith, but was replaced later that year. He was then selected by the Labour Party to fight the Newcastle East constituency at the 1922 General Election. Already ill, he was unable to travel from London to campaign in the seat, but was elected in his absence, defeating the Coalition Liberal MP, Harry Barnes. Bell died a month after his election, aged 58, and thus became one of only a handful of elected British MPs never to have taken their seats. At the subsequent by-election Arthur Henderson held the seat for Labour."

From 1946 onwards the family lived at Hedworth View in a three-bedroomed council house. As well his elected status, Joe held many other offices during his lifetime, including Councillor and Mayor of Jarrow, and Chair of the National Housing Committee. He was awarded the O.B.E. for services to the disabled and was a strong influence in the building of the Tyne Tunnel crossing in preference to a bridge, the construction of which would have required the demolition of many good quality council houses."

  "text" : "Joseph (Joe) Toole (1887 – 4 June 1945) was a British Labour politician. Toole was born in 1887, and was the eldest of thirteen children. He began working at the age of 12 as a street scavenger in Manchester by day and as a newspaper vendor by night. He subsequently had various jobs, before establishing his own stationery business. He joined the Labour Party, and was elected to Manchester City Council in 1919. In 1923 he was elected as Labour member of parliament for Salford South, unseating the sitting Conservative MP. In the following year another election was held, with the Conservatives regaining the seat. At the following election in 1929 Toole was able to regain Salford South for Labour. He was MP for two years before a swing against Labour at the 1931 general election cost him his seat. He stood again, without success, in 1935. Toole returned to local government as an alderman for the Openshaw ward of Manchester City Council. He was Lord Mayor of the city in 1936/37. In January 1944 Toole stood as an independent anti-government candidate at a parliamentary by-election in Skipton. Although he only garnered 3,029 votes and lost his deposit, his intervention was enough to enable Hugh Lawson of the Common Wealth Party to defeat the coalition candidate by 221 votes. Toole was promptly expelled from the Labour Party for breaking the war-time electoral truce between the main political parties. By the time of his death in June 1945, Toole had moved to Blackpool, where he operated a private hotel. He continued to be a member of Manchester City Council until his death."

Before his by-election success he served as a Labour councillor on the Denton Urban District Council, representing Denton West. Although reselected to fight Manchester Gorton at the 1983 general election, boundary changes substantially altered the constituency boundaries, with the largest part of the constituency, Denton and Audenshaw in Tameside Metropolitan Borough, merging with Reddish in Stockport Metropolitan Borough to form a new Denton and Reddish constituency. Gorton was included with much of the former Manchester Ardwick constituency, which was renamed Manchester Gorton. As there were potentially three Labour MPs contesting two new seats, Marks, who was the senior of the three, stood down, allowing Stockport North's Andrew Bennett to inherit Denton and Reddish and Gerald Kaufman to move across from Ardwick to the new Gorton seat."

Lancelot Mallalieu was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford., Cheltenham College and Trinity College, Oxford. At the 1931 general election, Mallalieu was elected as the Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Colne Valley. His win was notable as it was a gain from Labour despite the presence of a Conservative candidate, unusual for 1931. His predecessor was the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden, who had decided to stand down. His father Frederick Mallalieu had been MP for the same seat from 1916 to 1922. Mallalieu was a member of the main Liberal group in parliament led by Sir Herbert Samuel. He followed his leader into opposition in 1933. He served until the 1935 general election, when he lost his seat to Labour's Ernest Marklew. After joining the Labour Party, he returned to the House of Commons in 1948, at a by-election on 24 March in the Brigg constituency, where he served as MP until he retired in 1974. He was a Deputy Speaker of the Commons from 1971 to 1974."

Burgin trained as a solicitor specialising in international law and served as principal and director of legal studies to the Law Society. He contested Hornsey four times and East Ham North once, without success. In the 1929 general election Burgin was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Luton. Along with other Liberal MPs he joined the Liberal Nationals in 1931 and was made a Charity Commissioner. In 1932 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade. He was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1937 Coronation Honours. In 1937 Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appointed Burgin as Minister of Transport. Two years later he was appointed as the first Minister of Supply in April 1939. As the post had not yet been established in law, he formally served as Minister without Portfolio for the first three months. His appointment was aimed to appeal to liberal minded opinion but was criticised as being inappropriate - A.J.P. Taylor described Burgin as being \"another horse from Caligula's well-stocked stables\" (a follow-up to contemporary remarks about the earlier appointment of Sir Thomas Inskip as Minister for Coordination of Defence). When Chamberlain was replaced by Winston Churchill, Burgin was not included in the new ministry."

Pugh was the son of John Evans of Lovesgrove Cardiganshire and his wife Elizabeth Pugh daughter of Lewis Pugh. He was educated at Winchester College and Corpus Christi, Oxford. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1862. In 1868 he changed his name to Pugh by royal licence when he inherited the estate of his uncle Lewis Pugh. He was a J.P. and Deputy Lieutenant for Cardiganshire. At the 1880 general election Pugh was elected Member of Parliament for Cardiganshire. He held the seat until 1885. Pugh had a distinguished career as a lawyer in India, becoming Attorney General of Bengal. In 1905, he had the house built at Cymerau. He died at the age of 70. Pugh married Veronica Harriet Hills, daughter of James Hills of Neechindepore, Bengal in 1864. Veronica was the sister of James Hills who won the Victoria Cross in the Indian Mutiny. Family history says her younger brother Charles Hills (1847-1935) was the real father of Hollywood actress Merle Oberon (see Mile MacNair's book)."

  "text" : "Lord Arthur John Edward Russell (14 June 1825 – 4 April 1892) was a British Liberal Party politician. He was born in London on 14 June 1825, the second of three sons of Major-General Lord George William Russell and Elizabeth Anne Rawdon, daughter of the Hon. John Theophilus Rawdon, himself second son of the 1st Earl of Moira. His elder brother was Francis, later 9th Duke of Bedford and his younger brother was Odo, later 1st Baron Ampthill. He was educated in Germany and from 1849 to 1854 he was private Secretary to his uncle, the Liberal Prime Minister Lord John Russell. Between 1857 and 1885, he sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tavistock. He only spoke rarely in the Commons, once in reply to an attack on his brother Odo. On 25 September 1865, Russell married Laura de Peyronnet, daughter of Paul Louis Jules, Vicomte de Peyronnet. They had six children, Harold Russell, Flora Russell, the diplomat Sir Claud Russell, Caroline Russell, Major Gilbert Russell and Conrad Russell. He was raised to the rank of a Duke's son on 25 June 1872 and was then known as Lord Arthur Russell. He was a great clubman and belonged to Brooks's, the Athenaeum, the Cosmopolitan, Grillion's, THE CLUB, and the Metaphysical Society. He was involved in the Senate of the University of London, serving on this body from 1875 to his death. Russell died on 4 April 1892 at 2 Audley Square, London, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. There is a memorial to him in the 'Bedford Chapel' at St. Michael’s Church, Chenies. The ideological gulf between Britain and the new German Empire was stressed by Lord Russell in 1872: Prussia now represents all that is most antagonistic to the liberal and democratic ideas of the age; military despotism, the rule of the sword, contempt for sentimental talk, indifference to human suffering, imprisonment of independent opinion, transfer by force of unwilling populations to a hateful yoke, disregard of European opinion, total want of greatness and generosity, etc., etc.\""

Born in Marylebone, Cavendish was the third son of William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, by his wife, Lady Blanche Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (a daughter of the 6th Earl of Carlisle and a niece of the 6th Duke of Devonshire). His father and his two surviving brothers were all Members of Parliament (MPs): his eldest brother Spencer, MP for North Lancashire 1857–91 and later 8th Duke of Devonshire, led the Liberal Party and was asked three times to be Prime Minister by Queen Victoria; the middle brother, Frederick was MP for the West Riding and Chief Secretary for Ireland and was assassinated in 1882. Cavendish was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade. On retirement from the regular army he joined the 2nd Derbyshire Militia (later the Sherwood Foresters), but transferred to the King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment in 1888. Cavendish served as MP for West Derbyshire from the creation of the constituency until his death. Like his eldest brother, he became a Liberal Unionist in reaction to the Liberal Party's policy on Irish Home Rule. Upon his death in Marylebone aged 53, his son, Victor, was elected unopposed to replace him, later becoming the 9th Duke of Devonshire. Cavendish married his cousin Emma Lascelles, a daughter of the Rt. Hon. William Lascelles, on 3 August 1865. They had three sons:"

Lucy Middleton was an active member of Wimbledon Labour Party when the idea of publishing a book on the contribution of women to the labour movement was put forward as a way to celebrate International Women's Year. The Labour Party agreed to publish the book, and Lucy Middleton edited the essays of the 9 younger women she had invited to contribute. When finished the Labour Party General Secretary decided there was no money to publish the book, but Croom Helm agreed to publish it as \"Women in the Labour Movement, the British experience\" in 1977."

McKay joined the Independent Labour Party's Guild of Youth, then the Young Communist League, graduating to the Communist Party of Great Britain. She left the party in 1932, joining the Labour Party. She also became general secretary of the National Union of Domestic Workers. After holding various trade union posts, McKay stood unsuccessfully for Labour in Walthamstow East at the 1959 general election. At the 1964 general election, she defeated the sitting Conservative MP Alan Glyn for Clapham, taking the seat with a majority of only 556. At the 1966 election she increased her majority to over 4,000 against the Conservative Ian Gow, but she stood down at the 1970 general election, when the seat was won by the Conservative William Shelton. While in Parliament, McKay became a supporter of Arab interests, creating a mock Palestinian refugee camp in Parliament Square and wearing Arab robes during debates. Jordan issued a postage stamp in her honour. After retiring from politics, McKay moved to Abu Dhabi."

Wilson was the son of Mathew Wilson, a solicitor of Eshton Hall and his wife Mary Clive Wilson. His father and mother were first cousins. He was educated at Harrow School and Brasenose College, Oxford. He became a J.P. at the age of 22, and became the longest serving magistrate in Skipton's history at the time of his death aged 88. Wilson was elected in 1841 as Member of Parliament for Clitheroe but was unseated in 1842. He stood again in 1847 and regained Clitheroe, but after the 1852 election was unseated again in 1853. Notwithstanding these incidents of electoral malpractice, he was created a baronet on 28 February 1874 and later that year was elected as MP for West Riding of Yorkshire North. He held the seat until it was split up under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. In the 1885 general election, he was then elected for Skipton which he held until his defeat in 1886. He also became Deputy Lieutenant and Chairman of the Board of Guardians. He married, June Louisa Emerson Amcotts, only daughter of Sir Wharton Emerson Amcotts, Bart, of Kettlethorpe Park, Lincolnshire, on 15 June 1826. They had a son Mathew (1827–1909) who succeeded to the baronetcy. She died in 1833 and many years later Wilson married Frances Pedler. His son Mathew married Gratiana Mary Thomas, daughter of Admiral Richard Darton Thomas (1777–1857). Wilson died at Brighton aged 88."

In 1949 he intervened to delay Brian Close's National Service so the 18-year-old Close could complete the cricket season playing for Yorkshire County Cricket Club. In 1950, he was appointed as Minister of Food, a key job in a time of rationing, and was appointed as a Privy Counsellor. After his Bradford Central seat was abolished for the 1955 election, he ran in Bradford North and narrowly lost to the sitting Conservative MP. He died in June 1956 aged 51."

He was brought up in County Clare, Ireland, and, finding no employment, he \"drifted to London\" in 1948, aged 15, and worked as a railwayman until he entered politics. He was elected Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Islington North in a by-election in 1969 following the death of sitting MP Gerry Reynolds. He had previously been the secretary of the Constituency Labour Party. His selection over Keith Kyle was the subject of an investigation in the early 1970s by The Sunday Times newspaper. They highlighted his background with a local building company and the local Irish community and questioned the propriety of the tactics of his supporters during his selection as candidate. Regarding Northern Ireland he was staunchly pro-Nationalist and anti-Partition. In his 14 years in parliament, O'Halloran only contributed twice to parliamentary debates. O'Halloran was among the Labour MPs who defected to the new Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981. However, in 1983, the SDP chose John Grant, the MP for Islington Central (which was being abolished in boundary changes), to be its candidate in Islington North. O'Halloran left the SDP to stand as an independent Labour candidate in the 1983 general election. The official Labour candidate Jeremy Corbyn won while O'Halloran came in fourth with 11% of the vote. Grant came third with 22% of the vote. He retired to County Wexford with his wife, and lived there until his death at age 66."

He was a member of the Essex river authority from 1964 and local government officer at the Labour Party 1961-65. Having contested the seat three times previously, Ward was elected Member of Parliament for Peterborough in the October 1974 general election, defeating the Conservative Party's incumbent Sir Harmar Nicholls. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Reg Prentice, Secretary of State for Education and Science, and after Prentice left the government, Ward was PPS to Bill Rodgers, Minister of State in the Foreign Office. However, in 1979, Ward lost the marginal Peterborough seat to the Conservative Brian Mawhinney. Ward subsequently joined the Social Democratic Party but later rejoined Labour, working for the Greenwich constituency Labour Party. In 2005, his daughter Alison Seabeck was elected the Labour MP for Plymouth Devonport. Ward also served as the chairman of Charlton Triangle Homes in South East London. He was also the chairman of the Greenwich Labour Party Local Government Committee from 1996 until 2000 and of the Rochester and Strood Labour Party from 2003 until 2007."

Winstanley was born in Nantwich, Cheshire. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School and the University of Manchester where he was President of the University Union and captain of cricket. He graduated in medicine and served in the RAMC before becoming a general practitioner in Urmston. He became a noted media personality as a television and radio doctor in the 1960s and hosting Granada Television's This Is Your Right consumer advice show in the 1970s. Following his return to the House of Commons in 1974, Winstanley discovered that he held a post which would disqualify him from being a member of the House of Commons - a post of sessional medical officer at a Royal Ordnance Factory that amounted to employment in the Civil Service of the Crown. On 3 April 1974, the Commons passed a motion under section 6 of the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1957 to override the disqualification and allow Winstanley to sit. Winstanley was created a life peer on 23 January 1976 with the title of Baron Winstanley, of Urmston in Greater Manchester, during Harold Wilson's second term as Prime Minister."

  "text" : "Muriel Edith Nichol JP (born 2 Feb 1893 Wilmslow, Cheshire - died 28 May 1983 Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire), née Wallhead, was a Labour Party politician in England. The daughter of Richard Wallhead (Independent Labour Party chairman 1920–1922 and MP for Merthyr 1922–1934), she was married with one son, and worked as a teacher before entering parliament. She served as Chair of Welwyn Garden City Urban District Council from 1937 to 1945. At the 1935 general election she stood unsuccessfully in the Bradford North constituency in West Yorkshire, losing by a wide margin to the sitting Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) Eugene Ramsden. In the Labour landslide at the 1945 general election, she unseated Ramsden, winning the seat with a majority of 3,444 (a swing of 12.7%). After boundary changes for the 1950 general election, she lost her seat to the Conservative and National Liberal Party candidate, William Taylor. She was unsuccessful in seeking to return to Parliament for Stockport North in 1955 general election."

  "text" : "Nigel John Spearing (born 8 October 1930, in Hammersmith, London) is a British Labour Party politician. Nigel Spearing was born in London, and educated at Latymer Upper School, Hammersmith and St Catharine's College, Cambridge. After graduating in 1956, he worked as a tutor and teacher, firstly at Wandsworth School (1956–68) and then at Elliot School, Putney (1969–70). After coming second in Warwick and Leamington in 1964, Spearing was elected as the Labour Member of Parliament for Acton at the 1970 general election. At the February 1974 general election, he was defeated in his bid for re-election by the Conservative Party candidate George Young by 1,300 votes. Spearing then returned to parliament a few weeks later after winning the Newham South by-election (caused by the constituency's MP, Elwyn Jones, being made a life peer in order to take on the role of Lord Chancellor) with a majority of 9,321. This was the only by-election held in the February–October 1974 Parliament. Spearing was then re-elected at the October 1974 general election, and held the Newham South seat until 1997, when he was deselected in favour of Jim Fitzpatrick. Spearing was opposed to British membership of the European Economic Community."

He was the fourth and youngest son of Frederick Cawley, 1st Baron Cawley and his wife Elizabeth Smith, daughter of John Smith. His older brother was Harold Thomas Cawley. Cawley was educated at Rugby School and New College, Oxford, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts. He served as lieutenant of the Shropshire Yeomanry and became a captain of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry. He fought in the First World War, where he was killed in action near Merville. Cawley was buried in Néry Communal Cemetery. Shortly before his death in 1918, Cawley had been elected in a by-election in January to succeed his father as Member of Parliament (MP) for Prestwich. It was in memory of Oswald and two other sons - Harold and John - who died in the war that their father endowed a ward at Ancoats Hospital, Manchester, in 1919 at a cost of £10,000. All three brothers are commemorated on the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall. Oswald and Harold, on Panel 8, are among the 22 MPs that died during World War I to be named on that memorial. John, included on the memorial as the son of an MP, appears on Panel 2 of the memorial. Oswald Cawley is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes short biographical accounts of the life and death of the Cawley brothers."

In 1896 he joined the civil service (Inland Revenue Department). Later he read for the Bar and was called to Gray's Inn. He practised law in London until 1916 when he joined the Mond Nickel Company. Rising through the ranks, he eventually became chief administrative officer of the company. He later became vice-president of the International Nickel Company of Canada. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardiganshire at a by-election in 1932, following the resignation of the Liberal MP Rhys Hopkin Morris. Evans held the seat until his sudden death, probably of heart failure, shortly before the 1945 general election. His death robbed him of becoming a Knight Bachelor; his appointment had been announced in the Dissolution Honours List published on 7 June 1945 but he died before he could be knighted. In public life in Wales he was a member of the Councils of the University colleges of Aberystwyth and Swansea, treasurer of the college at Aberystwyth and of the National Museum of Wales. He was also a governor and member of the Council of the National Library of Wales."

When the constituency was divided at the 1918 general election, he was elected for the new Middlesbrough East constituency, but he was defeated at the 1922 general election by the Conservative Party candidate John Wesley Brown. With rifts in the Liberal Party healed, the party's fortunes recovered at the 1923 general election, and Williams regained his seat. His return was short-lived, because at the 1924 general election he was unseated in a close 3-way contest by the Labour Party candidate Ellen Wilkinson.At the 1929 general election he stood as the Liberal Party candidate for Berwick-on-Tweed where he came close to gaining the seat from the Conservatives."

When a general election was called in January 1910, P W Raffan was selected as Liberal candidate for Leigh in south Lancashire. John Brunner, the sitting Liberal member of parliament, had chosen to stand in Northwich. The constituency contained a large number of coalminers, and Raffan was opposed not only by the Conservatives, but by Thomas Greenall of the Labour Party, who was a leader of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation. Leigh was one of the few seats where Labour and Liberals ran against each other. Raffan won the seat easily. In the Commons Raffan became secretary of the Land Values Group who sought reform in property taxation. He supported women's suffrage, disestablishment of the Church in Wales and the temperance movement. At the 1918 general election Raffan was re-elected at Leigh as a Liberal and received the \"coupon\" despite being an opponent of the Coalition Government. At the 1922 election he stood unsuccessfully for election as a Liberal at Ayr Burghs. At the succeeding 1923 general election he successfully contested Edinburgh North for the Liberals, unseating the Unionist MP, Patrick Johnstone Ford. He only held the seat for one year, with Ford regaining the seat in the 1924 general election."

  "text" : "Rhys John Davies (16 April 1877 - 31 October 1954) was a British trade unionist and Labour Party politician. Davies was born in Llangennech, Carmarthenshire, Wales, the son of Rhys and Ann Davies. After an elementary education he initially worked as a farm labourer. He subsequently moved to the Rhondda Valley, where he worked as a coalminer for ten years. From an early age he was involved in the local co-operative society and became a union official organising shop-assistants throughout South Wales. This led to his moving to Manchester, to take up a post with the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees and later the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers. He was a member of Manchester City Council for thirty years, and also president of the Manchester and Salford Trades Council and of the Withington Divisional Parliamentary Labour Party. In 1921 W T Wilson, Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Westhoughton, died, and Davies was elected at a by-election to succeed him. He served in the first Labour Government in 1924 as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. This was the only government office he held. He retained the Westhoughton seat through successive elections until he retired from the House of Commons early in 1951 due to ill health. At the time he was the longest-serving Labour MP.Davies was a strong supporter of the temperance and pacifist movements, whose causes he advocated in Parliament and in the country. He was also a committed parliamentarian, and served as joint secretary of the British group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He married Margaret Griffiths in 1902, and they had three sons. R J Davies died at his home in Porthcawl, Glamorgan, in 1954, aged 77."

  "text" : "Richard Davies (29 November 1818 – 27 October 1896) was a Welsh businessman and ship-owner and nonconformist Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1868 to 1886. Davies was born at Llangefni, Anglesey, the son of Richard Davies, a merchant of Llangefni, and his wife Anne Jones of Coed Hywel. He was educated at Llangefni national school. When his father set up subsidiary businesses under the management of his three sons, Richard Davies was assigned to the old ferry-terminal of Porthaethwy, which was reconstituted as Menai Bridge. This timber importing business developed so successfully that all the family became involved and the business developed into large-scale ship-owning which generated considerable wealth, based to a large extent on guano.His brother, Robert, was renowned as a philanthropist. Davies became a notable figure in politics as a Welsh radical nonconformist. He stood as Liberal candidate for Caernarvon at the 1852 general election but lost by 93 votes. Davies was Anglesey's first Nonconformist J.P. and was High Sheriff of Anglesey in 1858. He was elected unopposed as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Anglesey in the election of 1868. He retained the seat till the 1886 general election, when he retired, being opposed to the proposal for Irish Home Rule. At one time Davies lived at Bwlch-y-fen, but afterwards at Treborth, opposite Menai Bridge and was a benefactor to Bangor Normal College and to the ‘British’ schools. He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Anglesey in 1884. Davies died at Treborth at the age of 77 and was buried in Llandysilio churchyard. Famously his final words are reputed to be \"cannot be fathomed\". A memorial to him is in the Menai Bridge English Presbyterian Church alongside memorials to other members of the family. ..(The Davies' family was closely associated with this church, it having been built at Robert's expense.) Davies married Anne Rees, daughter of Rev. Henry Rees of Liverpool and niece of William Rees in 1855 and had several children, one of whom was Henry Rees Davies."

  "text" : "Richard Rigg (1877 – 29 August 1942) was a British Liberal Party politician who defected to the Conservatives. Born in Kendal, Cumberland, Rigg was elected at the 1900 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Appleby division of Westmorland. Aged only 23, his majority of 11% was a surprise, since Appleby had returned only Conservatives since 1885. However, Rigg resigned from the Liberal party in November 1904 because he found himself in agreement with the Conservative government on so many key issues. The Liberals then selected Leif Jones as their candidate for the imminent by-election, and although campaigning began before Christmas, there was as yet no vacancy. Rigg claimed that the \"ruffianism\" of Liberals angry at his defection of the party had made him ill, and he went to an unnamed continental health resort to recover. He returned to England in February 1905, and resigned his seat 11 February 1905 by becoming Steward of the Manor of Northstead, telling the annual dinner of the Carlisle Conservative Club \"I am proud to be one of you now ... I have the satisfaction of feeling that what I have done was conscientious and right.\" At the resulting by-election on 2 March 1905, Jones held the seat, though with a reduced majority. Rigg subsequently served as a councillor on Westminster City Council, representing Great Marlborough ward from February 1924 to November 1925, and St Margaret ward from February 1930 until his death. He was elected Mayor of Westminster for 1939–40. He was a member of the Municipal Reform Party, the local government wing of the Conservatives. He died at Hove, East Sussex in 1942, aged 65."

  "text" : "Robert Climie (4 January 1868 – 3 October 1929) was a Scottish trade unionist and Labour Party (UK) politician. Robert was born in Kilmarnock, Scotland on 4 January 1868. He was the son of bonnet weaver Mary McGarvie and underground colliery fireman, Robert Climie. He was educated at the local Board School and served his apprenticeship in engineering at the Britannia Works, where he continued to work as an journeyman. Early in his career he became involved in trade union activity and joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Despite previously being a Volunteer Sergeant in the Royal Scots Fusiliers, when he became involved in socialist politics he opposed the Boer War and spoke out regularly against it at the ILP's outdoor meetings from 1899 - 1902. He was first elected as a local councillor for the ILP in 1905 and served for many years, with particular interest in public health and housing. As a nominee of Ayrshire Trades Council, he was a member of the Scottish Trades Union Congress’s Parliamentary Committee from 1910 to 1918 and from 1920 to 1923, and was Secretary to the Committee in 1914. He was elected to Parliament at the 1923 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Kilmarnock, having unsuccessfully contested the seat in 1922. He was narrowly defeated at the 1924 general election, but won the seat back again at the general election in May 1929. However, he was already in poor health by this time and he died in office later that year, aged 61. He was survived by his wife, Jeannie McIldowie Meikle, herself an active Labour Party worker, six sons and a daughter. He was an excellent speaker and formidable debater. In an obituary in the Kilmarnock Standard, 1929, he is described as... ...a small man of medium build, with dark hair and moustache, blue eyes and a fresh complexion. He was moderate in all things, always hard-working in the labour cause and a lifelong supporter of Ramsay MacDonald. Climie was teetotal although never formally attached to the temperance movement. In Kilmarnock, Scotland there is a street, \"Climie Place\" named in his memory."

At the 1966 general election, he was elected Member of Parliament for Cambridge, winning the seat by just 439 votes from the Conservatives at his third attempt, after the retirement of Hamilton Kerr. He had previously contested the seat in the general elections of 1959 and 1964, and also contested the surrounding seat of Cambridgeshire during a 1961 by-election. He died in office only fifteen months after being elected, aged 49, and the resulting by-election for his seat was won by the Conservative candidate, David Lane. Descended from a Welsh farming family, his grandfather, Jenkin Davies (1824–1893), was a leading Berkshire agriculturalist and County Councillor.

  "text" : "Robert Edward Boyle (March 1809 – 3 September 1854) was a British soldier and Liberal Party politician. Boyle was the fourth son of Edmund Boyle, 8th Earl of Cork, and his wife Isabella Henrietta (née Poyntz). He served with the Coldstream Guards and achieved the rank of Colonel. At the 1847 general election he was elected unopposed as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Frome. Boyle was returned unopposed in 1852, but that election was later voided after an electoral petition, because Boyle's position as Secretary of the Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick election was held to be an office of profit under the crown. He was re-elected unopposed at the resulting by-election in March 1853, and held his seat in the House of Commons until his death the following year, aged 45. Serving in the Crimean War, Boyle died of fever in Varna, and was buried at sea. He married Georgiana, daughter of Abraham Wildey Robarts, in 1844. They had one son and two daughters. Boyle died in September 1854, aged 45, and was succeeded as Member of Parliament for Frome by his nephew Viscount Dungarvan. His wife survived him by almost 60 years and died in 1911."

He was defeated in the 1874 general election by the Conservative William Vesey-FitzGerald, but when Vesey-FitzGerald was appointed as Chief Charity Commissioner in 1875, he was required by the rules at the time to seek re-election.

Clifton was the son of Sir Juckes Granville Juckes-Clifton, 8th Baronet and his second wife Marianne Swinfen, daughter of John Swinfen of Swinfen, Staffordshire. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He succeeded his father to the baronetcy in 1852, but had to live for several years in France because of his debts from gambling and horse racing (see George Samuel Ford). In December 1861, Clifton was elected at a by-election as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham. He was re-elected at the 1865 general election, but his election was declared void on 20 April 1866. He was re-elected for Nottingham at the 1868 general election but died a year later at the age of 42 from typhoid fever. In 1868 building work began on the Clifton Colliery at Wilford after coal was found on the estate. The colliery opened in 1870 after Clifton's death, as did the Wilford Toll Bridge for which he was also responsible. Clifton married Geraldine Isabella O'Meara, daughter of Colonel John O'Meara, in 1863. They had no children and the baronetcy became extinct upon his death. The Clifton estates went to his cousin's son Henry Robert Markham."

  "text" : "Robert Leake (1824 – 1 May 1901) was a British Liberal politician. Leake was the eldest son of Robert Leake of Manchester and Mary Lockett of Salford, Lancashire. After a private education he became head of Lockett, Leake and Company, engravers to calico printers. Leake became involved in Liberal politics in Manchester in the 1860s, and was over time president of the Manchester Liberal Association, the Manchester Reform Club and the Liberal Association of Salford. However, he declined to be a parliamentary candidate until the 1880 general election. In that year he was elected as member of parliament for the two-seat South East Lancashire Division, along with his cousin William Agnew. The Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 divided the South East Lancashire seat into eight single-member constituencies. Leake was elected as the first MP for the new South East Lancashire, Radcliffe cum Farnworth Division. He was reelected in 1886 and 1892. Prior to the 1895 general election, Leake announced his decision to resign. Leake made his residence at \"The Dales\", Whitefield, near Manchester. He was married twice."

He retired from Parliament at the 1997 general election. He was known as a hard-line left-winger who opposed any policy moves which he saw as edging Labour away from pure socialism. He once branded Neil Kinnock a \"traitor\" over the latter's denunciation of the Militant tendency activists who dominated local government on Merseyside. In 1992, Parry was arrested in Beijing when he and his colleagues unfurled a banner in Tiananmen Square protesting the shootings which had taken place there in 1989."

  "text" : "Sir Robert Pullar FRSE (18 February 1828 – 9 September 1912) was a Scottish Liberal Party politician in the United Kingdom. Pullar was born at Perth in February 1828, eldest of nine children of John Pullar (1803-1878), a dyer, and his wife Mary Walker. He was educated in Perth at Stewart's Academy in Atholl Street, Greig's Academy in Stormont Street, and at Perth Academy, also doing continuation classes in French and German. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1880 and in 1905 he received an honorary D.C.L. from St Andrew's University. He was apprenticed under his father in 1841, a junior partner in 1848 and ultimately senior partner in the local family firm of Pullars Dyeworks, a firm which also branched into dry cleaning, a technique he learned from Germany, establishing a plant in Tulloch in 1882. He was known as an extensive and generous donor to local charities and other local causes and a benevolent employer, although in the last year of his life there was a major strike in the firm when he refused to discuss wage rises. He was a J.P. for the County of Perth. He was knighted in 1895. He travelled widely in Russia, Scandinavia, America and the Middle East. He was elected unopposed at a by-election on 12 February 1907 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Perth, but stood down in January 1910.At the time of his election, he was six days short of his 79th birthday, making his possibly the oldest parliamentary debut of an MP in the 20th century. He rarely spoke in debates and was criticized by local trade unions for failing to support measures to help the unemployed. He married in 1859 Helen Mary, daughter of Charles Daniell of Wantage, Berkshire, England, by whom he had two sons. She died in 1904 and he, aged 84, in September 1912 after a seizure. He was buried at Wellshill Cemetery, Perth."

Crawford stood for parliament at Harwich in 1851, where he was elected Member of Parliament when the sitting member was unseated on petition, but was himself displaced on petition because it was alleged that the poll had closed three minutes before the legal hour. In 1852 he was proposed for the City of London, but declined to become a candidate although 3765 votes had been cast for him. At the 1857 general election Crawford was elected MP for the City of London. He held the seat until 1874. Crawford married Margaret Urquhart Cruikshank, daughter of the Rev. John Cruickshank, of Turriff, Scotland in 1836. His sister Jane married Henry Ray Freshfield, of the family of lawyers. Crawford died at the age of 76 in 1889. The caricature hangs on the 5th floor of Norman Shaw North, a building which houses many MPs. The caricature is signed by Robert Wigram Crawford himself."

He sat in the House of Commons from 1956 to 1979 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Blaydon. Woof was born into a mining family, although his great-grandfather had been a cabin boy on Nelson's HMS Victory. He was educated at a Durham County school, and left school to start work on his 14th birthday in Chopwell Colliery where he became a coal face worker, and also an officer of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) for 15 years, serving as treasurer of his local NUM branch from 1943. He was also a member of Durham County Council from 1947 to 1956. He was first elected to the House of Commons in a by-election in February 1956, following the death of the sitting MP, Labour's William Whiteley. He held the seat at the next six general elections, before stepping down from Parliament at the 1979 general election. In 1973, he and fellow Labour MP Tom Urwin were awarded costs and damages after being libelled by The Journal newspaper."

  "text" : "Ronald Arthur Chamberlain (19 April 1901 – 12 May 1987) was a British lecturer, housing consultant and politician. Educated at Owen's School, Islington and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, for many years he was secretary of the National Federation of Housing Societies He joined the Labour Party soon after the First World War. At the 1945 general election he was the party's candidate for the south London suburban constituency of Norwood. The constituency had been held comfortably by the Conservatives since its creation in 1885, but a landslide in favour of Labour saw Chamberlain elected member of parliament, overturning a Conservative majority of 12,456 to win the seat by 2,023 votes. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of Town and Country Planning, Lewis Silkin. Chamberlain was regarded as a \"maverick\" member on the left wing fringe of the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was disciplined after voting against the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949. He also controversially accepted an invitation to visit Francoist Spain, returning with favourable reports on the régime. He narrowly avoided de-selection prior to the 1950 general election. When the election was held he was unseated, with the Conservatives regaining the seat. In 1971 he resigned from the Labour Party over its support for trade unions whose only purpose he claimed was the \"continual forcing up of wage rates, regardless of their less fortunate brothers and sisters and equally regardless of the public interest.\""

He was admitted as an advocate in 1953, served as an Advocate Depute from 1964 to 1970 (from 1967 as a Senior Advocate Depute). He was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1967. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Caithness and Sutherland in 1959, Edinburgh North in a May 1960 by-election, and Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles in 1964 and 1965. He was elected and sat for Edinburgh Leith from 1970 until 1979. He served as Lord Advocate from March 1974 until May 1979, and was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1974. In 1979 he was appointed to the Court of Session and High Court of Justiciary as a Senator of the College of Justice, with the judicial title Lord Murray. His uncle David King Murray had been a Senator of the College of Justice from 1945 to 1955. In April 1977, the Young Liberals' annual conference unanimously passed a motion to call on the Liberal leader (David Steel) to move for the impeachment of Murray for allegedly mishandling a murder case. Despite the urgings of the then chairman of the Young Liberals, Peter Hain, Steel did not table such a motion in the House of Commons, but Murray agreed that the Commons still have the right to initiate an impeachment motion. Lord Murray was an active supporter of the World Court Project U.K., part of a worldwide network directed to obtaining a decision on the legality of using nuclear weapons. Success came in 1996, when the Court ruled, in an advisory opinion, that the use of such weapons and the threat to use them would generally be illegal as contrary to international humanitarian law. He died on 27 September 2016 at the age of 94."

  "text" : "Sydney Scholefield Allen QC (3 January 1898 – 26 March 1974) was a barrister and Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was married to Mona (née Irving) and they had two sons, John (advisor to Harold Wilson) and David. Born in Birkenhead to Joseph Allen and his wife Edith (née Scholefield), he was educated at Birkenhead Institute and Liverpool University, from where he graduated with first class honours in law. He served with the Royal Artillery during the First World War, and subsequently was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn. Practising in criminal law, his most famous brief was the sensational 1931 Liverpool murder case, acting as junior counsel for William Herbert Wallace, assisting Roland Oliver KC, who led for the Defence. Wallace was initially convicted of the bizarre murder of his wife Julia, and sentenced to death, but in a unique legal decision the verdict was quashed on Appeal, because the weight of the evidence did not support it, and Wallace was freed. Scholefield Allen was appointed a Kings Counsel in June 1945. He served as Recorder of Blackburn between 1947 and 1970. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Crewe at the 1945 general election, defeating the Conservative Home Secretary, Sir Donald Somervell, and held the seat until he retired at the February 1974 general election, a month before his death. His successor as MP was Gwyneth Dunwoody."

A farmer, he was elected to Norfolk County Council in 1934 and Swaffham Rural District Council in 1935. He contested South West Norfolk unsuccessfully in 1935, but in the 1945 election he snatched the seat by only 53 votes. In 1950, his majority increased to 260, but he was defeated in the 1951 election. In 1955, Dye regained the seat with a majority of 193, securing Labour's only gain of that election. The circumstances of his death were as follows. On Sunday, 7 December 1958, Dye joined protesters blockading the airbase, at Swaffham, in his constituency - the intended site of intermediate range nuclear missiles. On Monday, 8 December, he travelled to the House of Commons to table a question regarding the protests. On the morning of Tuesday, 9 December 1958 Sidney Dye was killed in a head-on collision with another vehicle near his home in Swaffham. On 18 December, an inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death, after hearing that the brakes on the MP's car, which was less than three years old, were \"completely ineffective.\""

In 1806 he was elected as M.P. for New Shoreham and he held the seat until his death in 1862. Burrell built a country mansion near Knepp Castle, known by the same name, near West Grinstead  and purchased an estate at Boulton. He owned a house in Richmond Terrace, London which was the subject of a court case in 1833 in which he argued that because the house was on the site of the former Palace of Whitehall, it was not liable to the poor rate of St. Margaret's, Westminster. Burrell married Frances Wyndham, the illegitimate daughter of George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont and Elizabeth Ilive, on 4 July 1808 at St. George's Church, Hanover Square. Their eldest son Charles Wyndham Burrell died aged seventeen, but his other sons Percy and Walter succeeded successively to the baronetcy and the seat of New Shoreham."

His father carried on business in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, and Charles received his early education in the town. He subsequently attended Owen's College, Manchester and University College, London. Swann became a merchant in Manchester, and became a leading member of the Liberal movement in the city. He was, by turn, the secretary, treasurer and president of the Manchester Liberal Federation. He was also president of the Manchester Reform Club and for nine years president of the National Reform Union. In 1885 he was the unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the new constituency of Manchester North. However, another general election was held in the following year, and Swann was elected as member of parliament. He was to remain Manchester North's MP until 1918. He was regarded as an \"advanced radical\", and took an interest in the constitutional affairs of India, attending the opening of the National Indian Congress in 1890. In 1906 Charles Schwann was created a baronet \"of Prince's Gardens in the Royal Borough of Kensington\" and in 1911 he was as appointed to the Privy Council. In 1913 Schwann changed his surname to Swann by royal licence. He married Elizabeth Duncan in 1876, and they had four sons and a daughter. Sir C E Swann died at his residence in Birkdale, Lancashire in 1929, aged 85. He was buried in Putney Vale Cemetery."

He married Marianne Georgiana Dashwood on 11 February 1847, and with her had six children: Louisa Emma, Edmund (4th Baronet), Robert Lindsay, Cosmo (5th Baronet), and two other daughters. His land included the ancient monument Stonehenge, but during his lifetime he not only refused to let the government agency for the preservation of ancient monuments even look at the property. It was rumored that an anonymous buyer wanted to buy the stones and take them to the United States; if Antrobus had accepted the offer, no one could have stopped him. He was elected MP for East Surrey in 1841, serving until 1847. He was subsequently elected as Liberal MP for Wilton in 1855, serving until 1877. He was High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1880. He succeeded to the Baronetcy upon the death of his father on 4 May 1870. Upon his death, he was succeeded to the Baronetcy by his eldest son, Sir Edmund Antrobus, 4th Baronet."

At the 1868 general election he was elected MP for Chelsea. He held the seat until 1874. Hoare had a restless temperament and expensive tastes including hunting and horse racing which left him short of money. In 1883, during the agricultural depression, he had to sell at auction many of Stourhead’s treasures including Sir Richard Colt Hoare’s collection of books on British history and a series of watercolour paintings by Turner. Hoare left Stourhead and lived in France in his later years where he fell ill in 1894. He returned to London and died at the age of 70 at 12, West Eaton Place, Pimlico and was buried at Stourton. Hoare married Augusta Frances Clayton East, daughter of Sir E G Clayton East, in 1845. Their only son died in childhood, and the baronetcy passed to a cousin."

He joined the Labour Party and the Transport and General Workers' Union and in 1937 was appointed a full-time officer with the union's Docks Group. From 1935 to 1939 he was chairman of the Whitechapel Labour Party. In the Second World War he was recalled as a Naval reservist and rose to the rate of Leading Stoker. In 1942 he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Whitechapel and St Georges, the first serving Royal Navy rating to be elected to Parliament. Following boundary changes in 1950, he was elected for the new Stepney constituency and served until his retirement in 1964. He served as Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1945 to 1951. A devout Roman Catholic, he was known as a campaigner against prostitution, which was a big problem in his constituency. He died on the day of the 1964 general election. Edwards was elected to Stepney Borough Council in 1934 and served on it until 1959. In 1944–1945, when he was already an MP, he served as mayor. Edwards' only son was killed on active service in 1944. He also had a daughter."

  "text" : "Sir Stuart Montagu Samuel, 1st Baronet (24 October 1856 – 13 May 1926) was a British banker and Liberal politician who was Member of Parliament for Whitechapel. Samuel was the elder brother of Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel. He attended the Liverpool Institute and University College School, Hampstead, London. He served as Justice of the Peace for the county of London. In 1889 he stood as a candidate for the newly formed London County Council for the Progressive Party, the municipal wing of the Liberal Party. He contested Whitechapel, and was elected with 1,523 votes, along with his running mate, Charles Tarling, who polled 1,477 votes. He served for one term, before standing down in 1892. Samuel was selected as Liberal candidate for Whitechapel in 1900, in succession to his uncle Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling, who had been the MP. He knew the constituency well, having represented it on the LCC. He held the seat for the Liberals with an increased majority. When the Liberal Party won the 1906 election with a landslide, he was again returned at Whitechapel. The Liberal Party faced the elections in 1910 against a resurgent Conservative Party. Despite this challenge, Samuel was re-elected with an increased majority, at both 1910 elections. Over the course of four general election campaigns in Whitechapel, Samuel had increased the Liberal share of the vote each time, taking it from 50.4% to 59.2%, changing the constituency from a marginal to a safe seat. In 1912 he was created Sir Stuart Samuel, Baronet of Chelwood Vetchery. In April 1913 he undertook a contract for the Government, which required him to resign his seat and face re-election at a by-election. His Conservative opponent from 1910 ran against him in the by-election. He was re-elected with a reduced majority. Samuel retired from politics in 1916."

  "text" : "Thomas Charles Reginald Agar-Robartes (known as Tommy) (22 May 1880 – 30 September 1915) was a British Liberal politician. Tommy Agar-Robartes was the eldest son and heir of Thomas Agar-Robartes, 6th Viscount Clifden, and his wife Mary (née Dickenson) and was brought up at Lanhydrock House, Bodmin. Educated at Oxford and a keen horseman, he played in the Oxford University polo team that beat Cambridge in 1903. He was elected a Member of Parliament for Bodmin in the 1906 general election, but lost his seat in June 1906 following a controversial election petition by the defeated candidate alleging illegal payments to potential voters. He was elected to the St Austell Division of Cornwall in a by-election in 1908 and held the seat until his death. He was commissioned a second-lieutenant in the Royal 1st Devon Imperial Yeomanry on 4 June 1902. At the outbreak of World War I he joined the Royal Bucks Hussars as an officer. Tommy then joined the Coldstream Guards and was subsequently posted to France & Flanders. Captain The Honourable Thomas Charles Reginald Agar-Robartes, in command of No. 2 Coy, 1st Bn, the Coldstream Guards, was wounded in the Battle of Loos on 28 September and killed by a sniper on 30 September 1915 after rescuing a wounded comrade under heavy fire for which he was recommended for the Victoria Cross. He is buried in Lapugnoy Military Cemetery, near Béthune. He is commemorated by a memorial in Truro Cathedral and in stained glass at Wimpole and Church Norton. Agar-Robartes is commemorated on Panel 8 of the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall, one of 22 MPs that died during World War I to be named on that memorial. Agar-Robartes is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which included a short biographical account of the life and death of Agar-Robartes. His younger brother Francis later succeeded their father in the viscountcy."

Dickson was elected to Westminster at the general election in 1874 as MP for Dungannon in County Tyrone, and re-elected at the 1880 general election. His re-election was declared void on 10 June 1880 following a petition from the losing candidate, Colonel Knox. His son, James Dickson won the seat at the subsequent by-election with an increased majority. He was returned to Parliament the following year in a by-election for the County Tyrone constituency, and held that seat until the Tyrone constituency was divided at the 1885 general election. He returned to Westminster three years later, in May 1888, when he won a by-election for the Dublin St Stephen's Green constituency. He held that seat until the 1892 general election. His daughter, Emily Winifred Dickson was the first woman to be elected Fellow of a college of surgeons in either Ireland or Great Britain and she initially had her practice in his home in Dublin while he was based there."

Having been selected as the Liberal Party candidate, he received the \"coalition coupon\" and there was no Unionist Party candidate opposing him. He won the seat with a majority of 8% of the votes over his Labour Party opponent. However, for the 1922 election, when he stood as a National Liberal, the local Liberal association has not only decided to run an anti-coalition candidate against him but had attracted former Liberal cabinet minister, Charles Masterman as their candidate. Masterman polled nearly twice as many votes as Broad. With the Liberal vote split, the Labour candidate was able to take the seat. At the 1923 general election, with the two factions of the Liberal Party reunited, Broad stood in the Leyton East, but came third with only 28% of the votes. He did not stand for Parliament again."

Duffield eloped with Amelia ('Emily') Maria Frances Elwes, daughter and sole heiress of George Elwes Esq of Marcham Park at Marcham in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) and granddaughter of the notoriously miserly John Elwes, MP for Berkshire. They had three sons and five daughters together. They inherited Marcham and extended the estate by the purchase of Upwood. Emily died in 1835 and Duffield married a second time to Augusta Elizabeth, 2nd daughter of Lieut-Col Robert Rushbrooke of Rushbrooke Park in Suffolk. They had two sons and three daughters.

He was the only son of John Horridge, chemist, of Tonge with Haulgh, and Margaret Barlow of Bolton, Lancashire. He was educated in Barnes, Surrey before becoming a solicitor in Southport in 1879. In 1884 he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple, serving in the Northern Circuit. In January 1901 it was announced that he was to be appointed a queen's counsel. With Victoria's death, the warrant was issued by her successor, Edward VII, and he became a king's counsel. In 1906 he was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester East, spectacularly unseating the former Conservative prime minister, Arthur Balfour. He particularly campaigned on the \"Chinese Slavery\" issue: the Conservative government's policy of using indentured Chinese labourers, housed in primitive enclosures, to operate South African gold mines. Horridge stood down at the next general election in January, 1910, and resumed his legal career. He was promptly appointed a judge of the King's Bench Division, a decision that was criticised as political at the time. He subsequently dealt with cases in the Divorce and Bankruptcy Courts, and also took part in the trial for treason of Roger Casement. He was elected treasurer of the Middle Temple in 1929. In 1937 he announced his resignation from the bench, aged 79. He was appointed a member of the privy council upon his retirement. He died at his home in Hove, Sussex in 1938, aged 80. Horridge was married twice. In 1901 he married Evelyne Sandys of Lanarth, Cornwall, who died in 1920. In 1921 he married May Ethel Markham, widow of Alfred Isenberg. There were no children from either marriage."

As a member of Sir John Burgoyne's relief commission in 1847 he rendered much active service during the famine, and in consequence of his services he was on 28 Aug. 1849 nominated a knight-commander of the civil division of the Bath, soon after Queen Victoria's first visit to Ireland. He served as secretary to the board of control from December 1852 to 1856, when he accepted the post of commissioner of inquiry respecting lunatic asylums in Ireland. On 30 August 1842 he married Anne Eliza Mary, eldest daughter and coheiress of John Hyacinth Talbot, M.P., of Talbot Hall, County Wexford.

He was educated at Highgate School from 1854 until December 1858, when he went to Winchester College, and at University College, Oxford (B.A. 1867, M.A. 1868). When he was 23, his unmarried uncle, Sir Thomas Phillips left him a fortune. He was an active mine owner with a mine at Darran Llanhilleth and in 1863 he sunk a mineshaft at Ebbw Fach. In 1880, Price was elected as MP for North Monmouthshire and held the seat for 10 years. In 1882 he was appointed High Sheriff of Monmouthshire. He was a captain in the Monmouthshire Militia and a J.P., living at Triley Court Abergavenny. He also rented Skreens Park, a large mansion near Chelmsford which is now demolished. After losing his Paliamentary seat in 1895 he became a county councillor and Justice of the Peacefor Essex. In 1898, he purchased Marks Hall with a fine mansion and deer park. Later he purchased the Villa Capponi, a fine 15th-century villa just outside Florence. His second wife suffered ill-health and they spent a large part of the year there. In 1907, in consultation with Sir George Murray of the Treasury and Sir David Prain, director of Kew Gardens, he made provision in his will to leave the Marks Hall estate to the nation in the interest of agriculture, arboriculture and forestry. During the Second World War, Earls Colne Airfield was built on the edge of the deer park, and much of the property was requisitioned. By 1949 the mansion was said to be in a dangerous state and it was demolished in 1950."

He became a railway clerk at Oundle and was national treasurer of the clerks' union, the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association from 1961, its president from 1964 to 1977, and was its acting General Secretary for four months in 1977 after the retirement of the previous General Secretary (David MacKenzie) on health grounds. He served as a councillor on Northamptonshire County Council from 1952 and as an alderman from 1961. Bradley contested Rutland and Stamford as a Labour candidate in 1950, 1951 and 1955, and Preston South in 1959. He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Leicester North East at a 1962 by-election, representing Leicester East from 1974. He served as parliamentary private secretary to the Home Secretary from 1966. Bradley was among the Labour MPs who defected to the new Social Democratic Party in 1981. In 1983, he stood for re-election in Leicester East but came third with 21% of the vote. This however may have had the effect of helping the Conservative candidate Peter Bruinvels beat the future Labour minister Patricia Hewitt by 933 votes. He died in Kettering aged 76."

However, he lost to the Conservative Anthony Beaumont-Dark at the 1979 general election. On the first day of the October Labour Party conference of that year, he gave a speech criticising the outgoing Prime Minister James Callaghan. Waving a clutch of policy papers which he claimed Callaghan had vetoed, he quoted from a popular television series featuring Jimmy Savile: \"\"Jim will fix it\", they said. Ay, he fixed it. He fixed all of us. He fixed me in particular.\" Delegates roared with approval and Tony Benn described it as a \"courageous speech\". Litterick died in 1981 aged 51."

  "text" : "Tom Myers (15 February 1872 – 21 December 1949) was a British Labour Party politician. Born in Mirfield, Myers left school at the age of 12 and spent several years working in coal mines and factories in the West Riding of Yorkshire before taking up employment at a glass bottle works. An early supporter of the Labour Party, he was elected to Thornhill Urban District Council in 1904. In 1910 the urban district was absorbed by the municipal borough of Dewsbury, and Myers became a member of Dewsbury Borough Council. At the 1918 general election Myers contested the constituency of Spen Valley for the Labour Party, but failed to unseat the sitting Coalition Liberal member of parliament, Sir Thomas Whittaker. Whittaker died in November 1919, and Myers was selected to fight the ensuing by election. The by-election came at the same time as a serious split in the Liberal Party over continuing support for the coalition government: Colonel B C Fairfax was nominated as the Coalition Liberal candidate while Sir John Simon stood as an Independent Liberal. The poll was held on 20 December 1919, although the votes were not counted until 3 January of the following year. Myers received 11,962 votes and was elected to the Commons, with a majority of 1,718 over Simon, and the coalition candidate trailing in a poor third place. The result was seen as sensational, with The Times describing it as a \"political event of great significance\" with voters deserting the government candidate in \"a humiliation which cannot be explained away\". The coalition finally fell in 1922, with a general election called for November. Myers defended his seat against Sir John Simon, now the Liberal candidate, and W O R Holton of the Conservative Party. Myers was defeated by Simon. He tried unsuccessfully to regain the seat in 1923 and 1924. He returned to Dewsbury Borough Council in 1935, and was the town's mayor in 1940–1941. He died in Dewsbury in 1949, aged 77."

  "text" : "Thomas Oswald (1 May 1904 – 23 October 1990) was a Labour Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom. He represented Edinburgh Central from 1951 until he retired at the February 1974 general election. His parents were John Oswald and Agnes Love, of Leith, where he was born in 1904. His father was also born in Leith, in 1869, but the family came from Fife. His grandfather Thomas Oswald (1835 – 1921) was born there (parish of Kettle) as was his grandmother Rachael Oswald, née Crawford (Collessie). Great-grandfather James Oswald was born in May 1813, in Kininmonth in the parish of Ceres, Fife. His father, John Oswald, was a dockyard worker. Thomas Oswald was educated at Yardheads and Bonnington Road elementary schools in Leith. On leaving school, he worked as a shop assistant, painter, shipyard worker and tram driver. He was later to make his maiden speech in the House of Commons on the subject of public transport in Scotland, in July 1952, a subject in which he was recognised as an expert. He was married in 1933 to Colina MacAskill MacAlpin (1903-1990), of Ballachullish, Argyll, daughter of Archibald MacAlpin and Margaret MacAskill. They had three sons and one daughter. He became a member and, in 1933, an official of the Transport and General Workers Union, which, as well as representing the interests of transport workers, was affiliated to the Labour Party, which Tom Oswald had joined in 1921. From 1941 - 1969 he was head of the Scottish Region of the Transport and General Workers Union (Trade Group Secretary, Scottish Region)  and during most of this time he was also an M.P. sponsored and supported by the TGWU. He stood unsuccessfully for Labour in the parliamentary seat of West Aberdeenshire in the General Election of 1950, achieving 2nd place with 23% of the vote. However, next year he was elected for Edinburgh Central in the General Election of 1951, with 52% of the vote, succeeding the Labour MP Andrew Gilzean. He held this seat for 23 years until the General Election of February 1974, when he was succeeded by the future Foreign Minister Robin Cook. Never a particularly safe seat, his majority dropped to 617 in 1959. Apart from his last election in 1970, he was always in a two way fight with the Conservatives (also known as Unionists in Scotland). Primarily a backbencher during this time, his only term in office was as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Scotland in 1967-1970, during the Wilson government. He was involved in the British Aluminium company's hydro-electric projects at Kinlochleven (near Ben Nevis) and at Foyers (on the south-east shore of Loch Ness) in the 1930s. With this knowledge he was the Chairman of the Select Committee on the North Wales Hydro Electric Power Bill (now Act) of 1973. From 1956 – 1966 he was Secretary and Treasurer of the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Group. After leaving Parliament he became a member and then later president of the Scottish Old Age Pensioners Association."

One of the founding group of the No-Conscription Fellowship in November 1914, early in the First World War, he was a member of its national committee and a signatory of the Repeal the Act (Military Service Act 1916) leaflet, which resulted in the committee members being prosecuted under the Defence of the Realm Act, a number of them, including Ayles, being imprisoned for two months. He was also imprisoned as a conscientious objector, and served as secretary of the No More War Movement, 1931–1932. He was a Councillor on Bristol City Council, first elected for the Easton ward in November 1919. He had been selected by Bristol East ILP to be their candidate for the 1918 General Election. but was replaced prior to the campaign. He was Member of Parliament for Bristol North from 1923 to 1924 and from 1929 to 1931; for Southall from 1945 to 1950; and for Hayes and Harlington from 1950 until he resigned his seat, on account of failing health, on 31 January 1953, by accepting the post of Steward of the Manor of Northstead. He died that July, aged 74. Ayles Road, a street in Yeading, which formed part of his constituency, is named after him. Several nearby roads are also named after important people in the history of the Labour Party."

Portsmouth's two MPs (one Liberal Unionist and one Conservative) had not stood for re-election, and Clough was one of the two Liberals elected to replace them. He was re-elected in 1895, but did not serve a full term, and resigned his seat on 23 April 1900 by the technical device of accepting appointment as Steward of the Manor of Northstead, a notional \"office of profit under The Crown\". The by-election for his seat was held on 3 May 1900, and won by the Liberal candidate Thomas Bramsdon. In the 1901 Census of London Clough is listed as a 54-year-old Chartered Accountant & Auditor, Magistrate and D L of the City of London living at Manor House, Upper Richmond Road, Barnes, Surrey with his wife Hannah and two sons.

The eldest son of John Essex, he established a wallpaper printing business. He entered local politics in the Wandsworth area of south London. At the 1900 general election he was selected by the Liberal Party to contest the seat of Lambeth, Kennington, but failed to be elected. At the next general election in 1906 he was elected as member of parliament for Cirencester in Gloucestershire. He held the seat until January 1910 when he was defeated by his Conservative opponent, Benjamin Bathurst. He returned to the Commons at the election of December 1910, when he was elected to represent Stafford. He was knighted in 1913 and made an honorary freeman of Stafford. Following a redistribution of seats, Essex stood at the new seat of Stoke-on-Trent, Burslem at the 1918 general election but was not elected. Essex was twice married: to Marie Chinchen of Swanage, Dorset in 1881. Following her death in 1883 he married Lizzie Benson of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1885, with whom he had four children. He died at his home at Bourton on the Water, Gloucestershire in September 1941."

He was the youngest child of the Liberal MP Duncan McLaren (1800–1886) and his third wife Priscilla Bright, a sister of the Radical MP John Bright. Two of his brothers, Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway and John also became Liberal Members of Parliament. Walter Mclaren was married in April 1883 to Eva Muller, who died on 16 August 1921. McLaren first stood for election to the House of Commons at the 1885 general election, when he stood as an \"independent liberal\" candidate for the Inverness district of Burghs, in Scotland. He had been nominated by the Free Church Constitutional Party, and polled strongly against the official Liberal Party candidate, taking 47.5% of the votes. At the 1886 general election he was elected in Crewe, where the sitting Liberal MP George Latham had not sought re-election. McLaren was re-elected in 1892, but lost his seat at the 1895 general election.He did not stand in 1900, when the seat was regained for the Liberals by James Tomkinson, but when Tomkinson died shortly after being re-elected at the January 1910 election, McLaren was the successful Liberal candidate in the resulting by-election. He held the seat until his own death in 1912, aged 59. Walter is buried with his parents in St Cuthberts Churchyard in Edinburgh. Although the monument, lying on the east wall of the first south section under Edinburgh Castle, is huge, Walter is relegated to a simple footnote at the base of the stone."

  "text" : "Major Wilfrid Foulston Vernon (1882 – 1 December 1975) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) between 1945 and 1951. Educated in the Stationers' Company's School and the City and Guilds Technical College in London, Vernon served in the RNVR during the First World War, before becoming a squadron major in the RNAS and was a major in the RAF in its early days. During 1918 he worked in the flying boat section at Felixstowe air base and after the war became chief draughtsman for the British Aeroplane Company. From 1925 to 1937 he worked at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, from which he was dismissed for failing to take proper care of classified information. During the Second World War he was involved in the foundation of the Osterley Park Home Guard School and worked as a lecturer in the War Office Home Guard School in Dorking and later became a WEA tutor. He was elected MP for Dulwich in the 1945 general election, but lost the seat in the 1951 election. He later served as a member of the London County Council and as a councillor in Camberwell. In January 1948 Vernon gave a speech on China in the House of Commons denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government and endorsing Mao Zedong's Communists. Vernon claimed that \"the Chinese government are running one of the most ruthless and cruel police states in existence,\" and called for Britain to adopt \"a policy of friendship and trade with the liberated areas\" under Communist control. He married in 1907 and again after the death of his first wife, in 1918. His second wife died in 1972. They had two children. He died in Bristol at the age of 93."

He first entered the House of Commons at the 1892. Aged only 22, he was elected as the Liberal Party MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, defeating the incumbent Liberal Unionist MP, Douglas Coghill. He was re-elected at the 1895 election, but was defeated at the 1900 general election. This was on account of his active service in the Second Boer War. He did not seek election again until the 1924 general election, when he stood as a Constitutionalist candidate in the Burslem constituency, but narrowly lost the two-way contest to his Labour Party opponent Andrew MacLaren. Allen did not stand in 1929, but when he stood as National Liberal at the 1931 general election he won the seat from MacLaren, who regained the seat at the 1935 general election. Allen did not stand again. He lived at the Allen family home, Woodhead Hall, in Cheadle."

  "text" : "William Arthur Wilkinson (1795 – 13 April 1865) was a British Liberal Party politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1852 to 1857. He unsuccessfully contested Sunderland at the 1847 general election and at a by-election in December that year. He was elected at the 1852 general election as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Lambeth, but was heavily defeated at the 1857 general election by William Roupell. He then contested Reigate at the 1859 general election, before standing again in Lambeth at a by-election in May 1862 following the resignation of Roupell, who defeated him in 1857 and had fled to Spain amidst allegations of forgery. However, he came a poor third, with less than 10% of the votes. He stood for a final time at a by-election in Reigate in February 1863, but was again unsuccessful."

He was asked to stand down by his Constituency Labour Party after the indecisive election of February 1974, when he appeared on television calling for an all-party government of national unity, and suggested that the Duke of Edinburgh could chair its meetings. In 1961, as a protest against bipartisan support for British nuclear weapons, he voted against the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, and British Army Estimates in the House of Commons, and was suspended from the Labour Party Whip from March 1961 until May 1963. Baxter received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1976"

He contested Guilford again in 1922 and 1923, and did not stand again until the Battersea South by-election in February 1929. The vacancy had arisen when the Conservative MP Francis Curzon succeeded to the peerage as Earl Howe, and in a three-way contest Bennett took the seat for Labour with a majority of 2.1% of the votes. He was re-elected at the general election in May 1929 with a majority of only 1.1%, but at the 1931 general election he was soundly defeated by the Conservative Harry Selley, whose majority was 36.2%. After his defeat, Bennett stood unsuccessfully at the June 1933 by-election in Hitchin, at a November 1933 by-election in Harborough and in the 1935 general election in Cardiff East. Bennett was never returned to the House of Commons, but after Labour gained control of the London County Council from the Municipal Reform Party in 1934, he was appointed on 13 March as an alderman of the Council."

At the 1832 general election Bolling was elected Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Bolton. He held the seat until 1841. Bolling and his family were deeply involved in the social upheavals associated with factory legislation, child labour and working class enfranchisement. They were dilatory mill-owners rather than opposed to any legislation and their mills came under attack from mass disturbance in 1842. Bolling was re-elected MP for Bolton as a Conservative in 1847 and held the seat until his death in 1848. His obituary notes that he had suffered a severe stroke the week before his death, and had died at his residence of Darcy Lever."

David Margesson the Conservative MP for Rugby and Secretary of State for War had been dismissed from his ministerial job after the loss of Singapore to the Japanese, but was ennobled as Viscount Margesson. The major parties had an agreement not to contest by-elections in seats held by any of their members, but Brown stood as an independent candidate in the Rugby by-election on 29 April, and was returned as the independent MP for Rugby. Brown was re-elected at the 1945 general election as an Independent MP against both Conservative and Labour opposition. However, at the 1950 general election, he stood again as an independent, but came third with 20% of the vote. The seat was gained for Labour by James Johnson. In 1951 he ran against Edith Summerskill at Fulham West."

Harker died in 1905 and, in 1906, his daughter Gertrude had repaired the old Chapel of St Mary the Virgin, which had been deconsecrated and left as a ruin, and established the Harker Memorial in Pateley Bridge Cemetery. Other family members named on the monument include his son, Robert, who was killed in action in France in 1915, and a descendant, Frederick, who was killed in action at sea in 1940. The Harker memorial was in a neglected state in 2006, but it was discovered that there was a forgotten Harker Trust Fund which had been set up to maintain both the memorial and churchyard.

  "text" : "William John Harper (22 July 1916 – 8 September 2006) was a politician, general contractor and Royal Air Force fighter pilot who served as a Cabinet minister in Rhodesia (or Southern Rhodesia) from 1962 to 1968, and signed that country's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from Britain in 1965. Born into a prominent Anglo-Indian merchant family in Calcutta, Harper was educated in India and England and joined the RAF in 1937. He served as an officer throughout the Second World War and saw action as one of \"The Few\" in the Battle of Britain, during which he was wounded in action. Appalled by Britain's granting of independence to India in 1947, he emigrated to Rhodesia on retiring from the air force two years later. Harper contended that British rule in the subcontinent should never have ended, and took a similar stance regarding his adopted homeland, reportedly declaring that it, South Africa and the neighbouring Portuguese territories would \"be under white rule forever\". He entered politics with the Dominion Party in 1958 and became Minister of Irrigation, Roads and Road Traffic in the Rhodesian Front (RF) government in 1962. The head of a far-right group within the RF, he called for Rhodesia to abolish black representation in parliament and adopt \"a form of political apartheid\". When the Prime Minister Winston Field resigned in 1964, Harper was a front-runner to succeed him, but lost out to Ian Smith, who moved him to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Each breakdown or setback during the early years of Smith's premiership prompted press speculation that Harper might replace him. In 1966, when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Harper led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to their rejection. Harper resigned from the Rhodesian Front in 1968, soon after Smith dismissed him from the Cabinet, reportedly because Harper had had an extramarital affair with a British agent. He subsequently became a vocal critic of the Prime Minister, greeting each step Smith made towards settlement with black nationalists during the Bush War with public indignation. By the time majority rule began in Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement of the previous year, Harper had left for South Africa. He died in 2006 at the age of 90."

The vacancy occurred at the height of the Second World War, and under an agreement between the parties forming the wartime coalition government, Guy was expected to take the seat at the ensuing by-election unopposed. In the event he was opposed by the Reverend Patrick Figgis running as a \"Christian Socialist\". The poll took place on 13 August, with a turnout of less than 10% of the electorate and Guy secured 3,375 votes to 541 for Figgis. Guy retained the seat at the 1945 general election, but retired from the Commons at the 1950 election, when the Poplar South constituency was abolished. He became a member of Poplar Borough Council, and was mayor of Poplar in 1953. He was a director of the Amalgamated Tobacco Corporation. He died in Poplar in August 1968."

The seat was held by the Unionists. At the 1929 general election, Martin stood in the Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency), a Unionist safe seat where he lost by a wide margin. His last electoral contest was in Glasgow Central at the 1931 election, where he was defeated by almost two to one."

He stood again in 1992 and 1923, as a Labour Co-operative candidate with the endorsement of the Labour Party, losing in both elections by a narrow margin of less than 3% of the votes. He won the seat on his fourth attempt, at the 1924 general election, defeating the sitting Liberal MP Herbert Harvey Spencer. Hirst was re-elected in 1929 with an increased majority. However, at the 1931 general election, the Labour Party had split over Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's decision to form a National government with the support of both the Conservative Liberal parties, and Hirst was opposed in Bradford only by a Liberal candidate, the Conservatives having stepped aside. He lost his seat by a huge margin of 32.6% of the votes. Hirts's seventh and final candidacy was at the 1935 general election, when he was defeated again, although he halved the Liberal majority to 16.8%."

His share of the vote had increased, but the absence for the first time of a Liberal Party candidate proved more beneficial to the Conservatives. He was re-elected to the House of Commons at the 1929 general election, but was defeated again when the Labour Party split at the 1931 general election. He regained the seat again at the 1935 general election, and represented Bradford Central for a further decade until he retired from politics at the 1945 general election."

  "text" : "William McCombie (1805 – 1 February 1880), was a Scottish cattle breeder and agriculturist; he was also known as \"the grazier king\" or the \"king of graziers\". Born at Home Farm, Tillyfour, Aberdeenshire, the home of his father, Charles McCombie, a farming cattle dealer with Highland roots. After receiving his education at a local school, he attended Marischal College in Aberdeen but despite his father's reservations, he sought to follow him in an agricultural career. Initially, McCombie's employment was within the extensive family farming business, part of which was transporting cattle to the borders of Scotland and into England for fattening. During the 1820s he rented the arable 1,200-acre (4.9 km2) Tillyfour Farm from his father and began the process of building up his own herd of black polled cattle. The herd already on the farm when he leased it were quality animals and influenced by Lord Panmure, McCombie blended two types of polled cattle from the Aberdeen and Angus varieties to form the basis of the black Aberdeen Angus cattle. McCombie referred to the date he founded his herd as 1832, which was the year his cattle gained a first prize in exhibitions. Over five hundred prizes were won by his cattle throughout the UK and at major exhibitions in France. In 1867 his book Cattle and Cattlebreeders was published; three further editions were later printed. A campaigner for the rights of farmers and their workers, he became the first tenant farmer elected to a Scottish constituency in 1868 when he represented the Liberal Party as the western division of Aberdeen Member of Parliament. He was returned with a majority in 1874 but two years later, in 1876, ill health caused him to resign his seat. He never married and died a bachelor at Tillyfour on 1 February 1880. The cattle herd was sold at a disposal sale in August 1880."

At the age of 14 he started work in the local colliery before winning a scholarship to the Central Labour College in London. At the college he studied economics, industrial history and sociology. He also began his association with Labour politics. He returned to the coalfields where he became a checkweighman. In 1928 he was elected to the West Riding County Council, holding the seat until his election to Parliament. Paling made his first attempt to enter Parliament at Burton upon Trent, where he stood unsuccessfully at the general elections of 1929 and 1931. Throughout the 1930s he was active in the miners' trade unions. At the 1945 general election Paling was elected to the House of Commons as member of parliament for Dewsbury. He was sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers and used his position in parliament to promote mine and industrial safety. His brother, Wilfred Paling, was also a Labour MP and held positions as Minister of Pensions and then Postmaster General in the labour Government of 1945–1951. Paling was re-elected at Dewsbury in 1950, 1951 and 1955. In 1957 he was making a visit to the British Army of the Rhine to examine the conditions of national servicemen when he was involved in an air accident. The resulting neck injury led to his retirement at the 1959 general election. Paling had a long retirement, dying in April 1992, aged 99."

He was born in Newport, Monmouthshire, the son of a clergyman. In early life he was a solicitor in Queensland, Australia, having been articled at Ipswich and Maryborough. He then speculated in mining shares. He was a Liberal Member of Parliament for Merthyr Tydfil, from 1888 to 1900, when he was defeated, losing his seat to Keir Hardie. The constituency had two members, the other being the Liberal David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda: there was antagonism between the two Liberals, however, and in 1900 Thomas backed Hardie. A major political issue between them was attitude to the Second Boer War, supported by Morgan who was on the Liberal imperialist wing of the party. He was in favour of Welsh disestablishment, making a lengthy parliamentary speech on a resolution in 1891."

He took up an apprenticeship to the pin and wire trade in Birmingham and subsequently set up his own business as a manufacturer of tacks and shoe rivets. In 1872 Cook was elected to Birmingham Town Council, and in 1875 became chairman of the Borough Health Committee. He was made an alderman in 1882, and served as Mayor of Birmingham in 1883/84. In 1885 he was selected as Liberal candidate for the newly created constituency of Birmingham East, and won the seat at general election of that year. He was only a member of the House of Commons for a brief period, however, as he was defeated by his Conservative opponent when another election was held in 1886. He was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for the Bordesley constituency of Birmingham at the 1895 general election. Cook was a justice of the peace for Warwickshire and the City of Birmingham, and made his home at Ashley House, Birchfield, Staffordshire, on the outskirts of the city. He was knighted in 1906.

He was a member of the executive or general council of the union on several occasions from 1893, and was chairman of the general council in 1910. At the 1906 general election Wilson was one of 29 successful Labour Representation Committee candidates, being elected MP for Westhoughton. On 22 February 1906 he introduced a private member's bill seeking to amend the Education Acts and create a statutory school meals service. The bill received the support of the government and was enacted as the Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906. He was made a whip in 1915, and was promoted to chief whip in 1919, when the Labour Party became the official opposition. W T Wilson died suddenly of a cerebral haemmorhage on a Bolton street on Sunday, 14 August 1921."

However, at the 1950 general election he lost his seat to the Conservative Party candidate Charles Hill, the former \"radio doctor\". Warbey re-entered Parliament at a 1953 by-election for the Nottinghamshire constituency of Broxtowe, following the death of sitting Labour MP Seymour Cocks. However, that constituency was abolished for the 1955 general election, when Warbey was returned for the new Ashfield constituency. He held that seat until his retirement at the 1966 election. He died in Eastbourne aged 76."

He was epileptic. Arriving in Quebec City in July 1862, Milton and Dr Walter Butler Cheadle traveled across the North American continent, wintering near Fort Carlton. After a challenging and at times humorous summer they reached Victoria, BC. Together with Butler Cheadle, he traveled up the Athabasca River and in 1863 they became the first \"tourists\" to travel through the Yellowhead Pass. They later co-authored \"The North-West Passage by Land\"  and \" Voyage de l'Atlantique au Pacifique, à travers le Canada\", which described their expedition in considerable detail. Following his adventure in Canada, Milton entered politics and became one of the youngest members of the House of Commons. He represented the West Riding of Yorkshire South between 1865 and 1872."
