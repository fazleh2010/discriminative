  "text" : "Aaron Reardon is an American Democratic politician and former Snohomish County Executive in Washington State. First elected to the post in 2003, Reardon was sworn in as the youngest serving county executive in America. On February 21, 2013, Reardon announced his resignation effective May 31, 2013. Prior to serving as Snohomish County Executive, Reardon served as a Washington State Senator and a member of the state House of Representatives. He holds a double degree in political science and social science with a focus in public administration and economics from Central Washington University. Reardon is married to Kate Reardon and lives in Everett, Washington with his wife and two children. Reardon attended Mariner High School in Everett and lettered in football, rugby and swimming. His interest in competitive swimming led him to attend Central Washington University, but his swim career ended two months after his arrival - he took a political science course during his first semester and was captivated. He graduated from Central with dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in Economics and Social-Science Public Administration. While at the university, he volunteered on multiple statewide and local Democratic campaigns. His experience running campaigns landed him a paid post-graduate position with the Downtown Seattle Association where he lobbied on behalf of Seattle businesses."

  "text" : "Albert Charles Weed II is a Virginia winemaker, businessman, and Democrat. Weed was the Democratic nominee for election to Virginia's Fifth Congressional District seat, in both 2004 and 2006, running against Republican incumbent Virgil Goode. In 2004, Weed lost 64% to 36%; Goode once again defeated Weed in 2006, 59% to 40%. Weed, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces Command Sergeant Major and veteran of the Vietnam War, has a B.A. from Yale University and M.P.A. from Princeton University. After working for the World Bank and in the private sector, he purchased a farm where he established a commercial vineyard and co-founded the Virginia Wineries Association. In 2002, Governor Mark Warner named Weed 5th District Trustee for the Virginia Land Conservation Trust Fund. In 2006, Weed faced competition for the Democratic Party nomination. Former Roanoke City Manager Bern Ewert argued that Weed had been beaten \"like a drum\" in 2004 and would probably lose again. Nevertheless, on May 20, 2006, Weed was chosen as the Democratic nominee by a 114-73 vote of the delegates to the party convention. In Weed's 2006 campaign, he emphasized the need for better treatment of military veterans. One of his campaign proposals was to establish a college for disabled veterans in the district. In both his campaigns, he advocated withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq."

In his capacity as alderman, he was a successful advocate for the \"macadamizing\" of public roads. In 1914, he owned a Studebaker automobile dealership in Mount Vernon. This business was later named Vernon Heights Garage. As mayor of Melbourne, he recommended to the City Council that they pass an ordinance to regulate the blowing of whistles by the passing railroad. It had been an ongoing source of complaints for many years. He advocated for the creation of a hospital, and contributed his salary and other mayoral fees to create a hospital building fund. After his term, he was appointed a municipal judge. In 1932, he and his son Floyd returned to Mount Vernon and reopened the dealership under the name Vernon Park Motors, Inc."

A native of upstate New York, Parker practiced law in Kingston, New York, before being appointed to the New York Supreme Court and elected to the New York Court of Appeals; he served as Chief Judge of the latter from 1898 to 1904, when he resigned to run for president. In 1904, he defeated liberal publisher William Randolph Hearst for the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. In the general election, Parker opposed popular incumbent Republican President Theodore Roosevelt. After a disorganized and ineffective campaign, Parker was defeated by 336 electoral votes to 140, carrying only the traditionally Democratic Solid South. He then returned to practicing law. He managed John A. Dix's successful 1910 campaign for Governor of New York and served as prosecution counsel for the 1913 impeachment of Dix's successor, Governor William Sulzer."

She has represented the 15th district in Minnehaha County as a Democrat since January 2011. A fourth generation South Dakotan, Buhl was born in Aberdeen and raised in Yankton. An adoptee, her parents were small business owners. She graduated from the University of South Dakota in 2007 with a degree in psychology and music. In 2010, Buhl-O'Donnell ran against incumbent state senator Kathy Miles, a fellow Democrat. In the primary election held on June 8, 2010, Buhl-O'Donnell received 398 votes while Miles earned only 276. Buhl was therefore nominated and, since no Republicans or independents had filed, she won the general election unopposed. She took office in January 2011. Buhl was re-elected in 2012 for a second term. Buhl-O'Donnell is openly bisexual and was the first LGBT member of the South Dakota Legislature. Her 2012 re-election campaign won the support of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund. Her husband is Jacob O'Donnell."

  "text" : "(For the American football player, see Antoine Thompson (American football).) Antoine Maurice Thompson (born March 1, 1970) was a Democratic New York State Senator who represented the state's 60th Senate district, which includes parts of Buffalo and Tonawanda, the City of Niagara Falls and the Town of Grand Island. Thompson previously served for six years as the Masten District councilman in the Buffalo Common Council. Thompson has been a lifelong Buffalonian and held political and politically related professional positions in Buffalo before his service in elective politics. Thompson was appointed to the city council in 2001 and was twice re-elected. He was discouraged from pursuing his interest in election to the United States House of Representatives in 2005. He was encouraged to pursue a New York Senate Seat, but was not nominated by the Democratic Party when the seat first became available in a special election. However, during the 2006 general election for the seat, he was victorious. Thompson was challenged in the 2008 primary by the current holder of the seat but was victorious and was unchallenged in the November election. In 2010 Thompson won a 3-way primary battle but lost to Mark Grisanti, a Democrat who ran as a Republican. After the election Grisanti became a Republican."

  "text" : "Arthur Sewall (November 25, 1835 – September 5, 1900) was a U.S. Democratic politician from Maine most notable as William Jennings Bryan's first running mate in 1896. As the Populist Party nominee, Bryan had another running mate as well, Thomas E. Watson. Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896. Arthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. His main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee. Sewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900. Sewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican."

Garrett married Eliza Clark in 1825 and moved to Chicago from New York in 1834. He had a small auction house near the Chicago River and by the following year had formed a partnership with the Brown Brothers, which allowed him to become a leading land speculator and auctioneer. By October 1836, he had sales of more than $1.8 million. Elected mayor in 1843, he won re-election in 1844 only to have the election invalidated based on charges of \"illegal proceedings and fraud.\" Garrett ran in a second election that year, losing to Alson Sherman. During his terms in office, Garrett pushed to have the first brick school in Chicago, Dearborn School, turned into either a warehouse or an insane asylum, believing that the building was too large for use as a school. Following his death, Eliza established the Garrett Bible Institute, now Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary, in nearby Evanston, Illinois."

Prior to her election to the Connecticut House, Lambert served as a member of Milford's Board of Aldermen, elected from the city's Second District. In September 2009, Lambert made national headlines along with fellow Democratic Representative John Hennessy when an Associated Press photograph taken by photographer Jessica Hill depicting them playing solitaire on state-issued laptop computers during a budget hearing at the State Capitol was posted on the Internet. State House Minority Leader Larry Cafero, who was speaking on the Capitol floor at the time, said that the picture \"speaks for itself\" in regard to the legislators' priorities. Lambert retorted that she was \"still listening to [Cafero]\". On March 23, 2010, Lambert announced that she would not seek another term in the General Assembly. She was succeeded by fellow Democrat Kim Rose in January 2011."

Bevor er zum Bürgermeister gewählt wurde, war er Stabschef von Evan Bayh, dem früheren Gouverneur von Indiana. Peterson schlug seine Kontrahentin Sue Anne Gilroy mit 52 % der Stimmen und wurde so der erste demokratische Bürgermeister der Stadt seit 1967. 2003 wurde er mit 63 % der Stimmen wiedergewählt. 2007 unterlag Peterson seinem republikanischen Kontrahenten Greg Ballard und verpasste damit seine dritte Amtszeit."

  "text" : "Baxter Ward (November 5, 1919 – February 4, 2002) was a television news anchor who served two terms on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Prior to his election on the board, he ran third in an unsuccessful bid to unseat Sam Yorty for Mayor of Los Angeles in 1969. Ward served as a supervisor from 1972–1980. As supervisor Ward was a strong advocate for public transport. Under his aegis the county acquired eight rail cars, dubbed El Camino, to bootstrap commuter rail in the Los Angeles area. This effort failed, although the cars operated on Amtrak's San Diegan route for six months in 1978. Critics dubbed the train \"Baxter Ward's Choo-Choo\" and it contributed to his failed re-election in 1980. He was born Baxter Ward Schwellenbach in Superior, Wisconsin, and grew up in Ephrata, Washington. He was the nephew of Lewis Baxter Schwellenbach. During the 1950s and early 60s he introduced a non-fiction documentary television show called Adventure Tomorrow with Dr. Martin L. Klein, which presented technology of the exciting years of the early Space Age. The program's producer, George Van Valkenburg described the series as covering anything that moves, flies or explodes. , Ward was a television news anchor first at KCOP-Channel 13, and then with KABC-Channel 7 in Los Angeles before he ran for Mayor."

He took office following the resignation of John V. Kenny. Berry achieved a level of notoriety for having banned both rock and roll music as well as an \"obscene\" film from Jersey City during his tenure. Berry banned the film The Moon Is Blue from being shown for being \"indecent and obscene\" and refused to allow Bill Haley and the Comets to play a concert at municipally-owned Roosevelt Stadium. The latter act is believed to have inspired Haley to write the first protest song in rock and roll, \"Teenager's Mother,\" which included the lyrics \"Are you right? Did you forget too soon? How much you liked to do the Charleston?\" In 1956, after the 1954 closing of the US immigration station, Berry commandeered a US Coast Guard cutter and led a contingent of New Jersey officials on an expedition to claim Ellis Island."

  "text" : "Bernie Hansen (born November 26, 1944) is a former longtime Chicago alderman, serving on the Chicago City Council from 1983 to 2002, when he retired as alderman of the 44th Ward citing health reasons. He is a Democrat. Hansen was appointed to the Council when the incumbent alderman, John Merlo, unexpectedly resigned. In 1987 he defeated Dr. Ron Sable, a liberal gay activist, by a 52% to 47% margin in the race for 44th Ward alderman. It was a hard-fought campaign in the city's 44th Ward, which at the time was the heart of the city's gay community. Sable ran against Hansen again in 1991, but Hansen prevailed again, 65% to 35%. From 1994 to 2000, he served as one of four U.S. commissioners to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, a presidential appointment to a bilateral treaty organization with Canada responsible for fisheries management research and recommendations and for sea lamprey control for the Great Lakes fisheries. For part of that time, he chaired the commission. He sponsored or co-sponsored several human rights ordinances, including the Human Rights Ordinance expanding protection against discrimination in housing, employment, public accommodations, and credit to gay males, lesbians, and persons with disabilities, an ordinance to assist victims of hate crimes, and a 1997 ordinance Hansen introduced to extend health-care benefits to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian city employees. Thomas M. Tunney, his successor as 44th Ward alderman whom Hansen had \"hand-picked\", became Chicago's first openly gay alderman. Hansen was also an active proponent of environmentalist measures, including recycling programs and the extension of Chicago's moratorium against the creation of new landfills. Some residents of the Lakeview community voiced concern that Hansen was more concerned with building expensive condos and co-ops, then re-building the neighborhood with affordable housing during his tenure. He serves on the board of many community councils as well as fund raising organizations, including the John Merlo Sports Program. John Merlo was the son of Mike Merlo leader of the Unione Siciliana during the 1920s. Mike Merlo had such complete control of the Organized Crime activities in Chicago, that upon his death in 1924, a war between north side gangs against Johnny Torrio (with underling) Al Capone at his side, instantly erupted. The war lasted 4 bloody years and included the St. Valentines Day Massacre. After his retirement from the city council, he continued to serve as Democratic committeeman from the 44th Ward, ultimately handing over the title to Alderman Tom Tunney. John Merlo held the position from 1969-92. Hansen made an attempt to be a Democratic Congressional Candidate for Illinois' 5th District in 2002, but when the Democratic National Committee backed Clinton Administration phenom Rahm Emanuel in the race, Hansen withdrew and soon after resigned from the 44th Ward Aldermanic seat. He is married to Annette and has two sons, Paul and David. He has two grandchildren. He attended the University of Chicago and has residences in both Chicago and Arizona. He is a longtime Cubs fan and avid golfer."

  "text" : "William \"Bill\" McBride (May 10, 1945 – December 22, 2012) was an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he challenged Jeb Bush for Florida governor in the 2002 gubernatorial election. Bush won by a 56 to 43 percent margin, making him the first Republican governor of Florida to serve two terms. McBride had earlier defeated former United States Attorney General Janet Reno in the Democratic primary. McBride was born in Belleville, Illinois and grew up in Leesburg, Florida. He graduated from the University of Florida in 1967. While at UF, McBride served as treasurer of Florida Blue Key and was inducted into the University of Florida Hall of Fame. McBride served in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1971. McBride was awarded a Bronze Star with a Valor device. Upon his return to the United States, McBride taught at Officer Candidates School at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Upon leaving the Marine Corps, McBride attended the University of Florida Law School. While studying law he fell under the tutelage of Chesterfield Smith, a powerful politically connected Florida attorney and then president of the American Bar Association. McBride left law school for a time to serve as Smith's assistant at the ABA. After graduation, McBride joined Smith's Tampa law firm, Holland & Knight, where he rose in the ranks until becoming managing partner in 1992. McBride's tenure at the helm of Holland & Knight has been the source of some controversy. He is credited with having expanded the firm's size and power and with having helped to make it the seventh-largest firm in the U.S. by number of lawyers employed at the time of his retirement in 2001. At the time the firm ranked 21st in terms of revenue but 98th in terms of profit-per-partner, and had \"become known as a reputable, but flabby, operation, long on underproductive partners and comparatively short on workhorse associates.\" McBride was the father of two children with his wife, Adelaide \"Alex\" Sink, a former statewide president for NationsBank (now Bank of America), former Chief Financial Officer of Florida, and 2010 Democratic nominee for Governor of Florida. Since 2003, Bill McBride was partner with the law firm of Barnett, Bolt, Kirkwood, Long & McBride in Tampa. He was also chair of the board of the investment banking firm Hyde Park Capital Partners, LLC, with offices in Tampa and Charlotte, North Carolina. McBride was a member of the American Law Institute and was a member of the board of directors of the Warrington College of Business Administration's Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Florida. McBride was named Mr. Leesburg High while still a student. He attended Boy's State while in school and ran a successful campaign for governor at the event. McBride died on December 22, 2012, after suffering a heart attack while vacationing with his family in Mt Airy, North Carolina."

He ran for state representative in 2010, one of three candidates seeking two seats in the Bennington-2-1 district.

In the general election held on November 2, 2010, Campion won 1,461 votes, finishing behind Corcoran's 1,965 but ahead of Krawczyk's 1,120. He was therefore elected and took office on January 5, 2011. He won re-election in 2012. Campion was elected to the Vermont Senate in 2014. Campion is openly gay; he lives in Bennington with his partner Eric Hatch.

Almost a decade later, December 15, 2005, BART Director Ward Allen attained another major milestone as a woman in politics when she was elected among her colleagues on the BART Board of Directors to serve as its president and Lynette Sweet as its vice president, which made BART the first major transportation agency to be led by two African-American women in American history."

  "text" : "Carleton \"Carty\" S. Finkbeiner (born May 30, 1939, in Toledo, Ohio) is a Democratic Party (United States) politician who is the former mayor of Toledo, Ohio. First elected in 1993, he took office on January 1, 1994. In 1997, he defeated challenger Nick Wichowski to win a second term. Term limits prevented him from running a third consecutive time. He was succeeded by former mayor Jack Ford in 2002. Following his first administration, Finkbeiner served on the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority board. He joined the ABC affiliate in Toledo and hosted Carty & Company, a Sunday morning public affairs show. He also contributed a weekly editorial segment, It's Just Not Right! Finkbeiner left WTVG in May 2005. On June 30, 2005, Finkbeiner announced that he would seek a third term as mayor. He won the Toledo mayoral primary, winning roughly 37% of the vote in comparison to 29% earned by incumbent Ford. On November 8, 2005, Finkbeiner was re-elected mayor. Finkbeiner was sworn in for his third term as mayor in a private ceremony on January 3, 2006. Finkbeiner has proved to be a very controversial mayor for the city of Toledo due to many of his policies, behavior, and public gaffes (see \"Controversy\" section). Toward the end of Finkbeiner's third term as mayor a recall effort drive to remove him from office was successfully put on the ballot but was ultimately struck down by the Ohio Supreme Court due to technicalities. Carty announced that his third run as mayor will be his final one and he would not seek re-election. According to city finance records verified by the Toledo Blade Finkbeiner left the city with a 48 million dollar deficit  which was inherited by Ohio Fire Marshall Michael P. Bell, an Independent, who succeeded Carty Finkbiener in 2010. Finkbeiner currently resides with his wife, Amy Finkbeiner, in South Toledo. He has three children: Ryan, Jenny, and Katie, and five grandchildren. Carlton Finkbeiner announced plans to run for a fourth term as mayor of Toledo on August 29, 2015."

  "text" : "Charles Wainman Burson was a legal counsel and Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States under Al Gore. He assumed the position of legal counsel from Kumiki Gibson in February 1997 after serving almost a decade as Tennessee Attorney General. In 1999 Charles Burson became Gore's Chief of Staff, replacing Ron Klain who resigned in August of that year. Burson is the son of Josie Burson and Leo Burson. He grew up in Shelby County, Tennessee, where he graduated from Central High School in Memphis in 1962. Burson received his Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of Michigan, his Master of Arts from the University of Cambridge, and his J.D. from Harvard Law School. Burson was a friend of Gore for over three decades at the time of his appointment as Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States. Charles Burson first became friends with the future Vice President in 1968 during the time Gore was studying Tennessee history at Memphis State University. In 1984 he was the chairman of Gore's senatorial campaign. This continued a family tradition of involvement with the Gores. Burson's parents were active in Tennessee Democratic politics, and his mother had held a position in Albert Gore Sr.'s senatorial campaign in 1958. Before joining the White House, Charles Burson held a variety of public and private roles. From 1970 until 1988, he worked in private practice as a lawyer. He briefly flirted with active politics in the 1978 when he lost a race to Republican Ed Williams for the East Memphis seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. In 1988 he was appointed the Tennessee Attorney General. In this capacity, Burson served on a number of public legal bodies. He was a member of the Tennessee Board of Law Examiners, of the Tennessee Code Commission and of the Commission on the Future of the Judicial System. Burson also represented the state several times before the Supreme Court of the United States. One notable case he argued was Burson v. Freeman, which established a state's ability to regulate election advertising on voting day. After his time in the White House, Burson served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the global agribusiness corporation, Monsanto. Burson is married to Bunny Burson and has two daughters, Clare and Kate. He presently resides in St. Louis, Missouri, teaches at the Washington University School of Law and is of counsel to the St. Louis law firm Bryan Cave."

He also worked as a speech writer for Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign. Prior to entering politics, O'Byrne became an attorney and subsequently joined the Catholic priesthood, and was a member of the Society of Jesus for twelve years. He wrote and sold a manuscript to Crowne, a division of Random House, with a working title Going My Way, a memoir of his time in religious formation and as a priest but has held back on releasing the book. An article touching on some of the topics considered in his manuscript was published in Playboy magazine in 2002. He is now a practicing Episcopalian. O'Byrne is an active athlete having completed two New York City Marathons and in June 2007 completed his first triathlon."

Charles Cathcart wurde auf Madeira geboren, wo sein Vater als Konsul der Vereinigten Staaten fungierte. Später lebte die Familie in Spanien, ehe 1819 die Rückkehr in die USA erfolgte. Cathcart fuhr danach zunächst zur See, ehe er 1830 nach Washington, D.C. zog und dort als Beamter für das General Land Office arbeitete. Schließlich ließ er sich 1833 in Indiana nieder. Er wurde Friedensrichter im LaPorte County und betätigte sich in der Landwirtschaft sowie als Landvermesser. 1837 übernahm Charles Cathcart sein erstes politisches Amt, als er in den Senat von Indiana gewählt wurde, in dem er bis 1840 verblieb. Einige Jahre später zog er für die Demokraten ins Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten ein; diesem gehörte er zwischen dem 4. März 1845 und dem 3. März 1849 an. Am 6. Dezember 1852 erfolgte dann die Ernennung zum US-Senator als Nachfolger des verstorbenen James Whitcomb. Bereits am 18. Januar 1853 schied er wieder aus dem Senat aus. Ein weiterer Versuch, ins Repräsentantenhaus gewählt zu werden, verlief 1860 erfolglos. Cathcart zog sich danach aus der Politik zurück und beschränkte sich auf seine landwirtschaftliche Tätigkeit. 1888 starb er auf seiner Farm in der Nähe von La Porte."

He graduated from the University of Buffalo with a medical degree in 1866. On May 5, 1869, he married Caroline Trautmann in New York City; she died in 1888 and he remarried in 1892 to Lois Masten, head nurse at Buffalo General Hospital. From 1870 to 1878, he was surgeon and major of the 65th Regiment, of the New York National Guard. From 1874 on, he was either attending or consulting physician at Buffalo General Hospital. Diehl was elected mayor of Buffalo on November 2, 1897, as the Democratic candidate. In 1898, an amendment to extend the Mayor's term to four years was adopted. During his term, the world saw the first successful generation and transmission of electricity by the power of Niagara Falls to Buffalo. In addition, the city was in the throes of preparing for the Pan-American Exposition. Mayor Diehl had formally invited President William McKinley to the Exposition, and was with him when he was struck down by Leon Czolgosz. He did not run for re-election. After his term, he returned to private life and his medical practice. He died on February 20, 1918."

  "text" : "Craig Anthony Washington (born October 12, 1941) is an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician from Texas who served in the Texas State Senate and the United States House of Representatives. The son of Roy and Azalia Washington, Washington graduated from Prairie View A&M University in 1966 and was originally interested in becoming a doctor, but as admissions to medical school had already ceased, Washington decided to instead apply at Texas Southern University's law school. In 1972, the state of Texas began electing members of the state House of Representatives and State Senate, for the first time, by single-member districts. Washington, along with four other minority candidates, Anthony Hall, George T. \"Mickey\" Leland, Benny Reyes and Cecil Bush, (dubbed the \"People's Five\"), ran for seats in the Texas House of Representatives. Washington was elected, and represented District 86 in the state House from 1973 to 1982. He then represented District 13 in the state senate from 1983 until 1989. Washington was elected as a Democrat to the 101st United States Congress for Texas's 18th congressional district, by special election, December 9, 1989, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mickey Leland. He was reelected to the 102nd United States Congress and 103rd United States Congress and served from December 9, 1989, to January 3, 1995. He took stands against some projects, like the International Space Station, where spending would have flowed to his district. In March, 1994, Washington was routed in the Democratic primary by Houston City Councilwoman Sheila Jackson Lee, winning only 36.5 percent of the vote. Lee won in November and still holds the seat today. Since leaving Congress, Washington has practiced law in Houston and Bastrop, Texas. On New Year's Day 2008, Washington shot at a car containing two teenagers. After being indicted by a grand jury in 2009, he agreed to two years of probation. However, Washington's attorney subsequently claimed that Washington fired because his life was in danger. Washington has since countersued the teenagers, alleging assault and property damage. The Internal Revenue Service has also sued Washington, alleging that he owes $610,000 in unpaid taxes. On January 8, 2015, Washington received a suspension of his Texas attorney's license. The 335th District Court of Bastrop County, Texas found that Washington had violated various rules, including the rules prohibiting neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him and failing to keep a client reasonably informed. On March 12, 2015, a \"modified judgment was entered imposing a four-year partially probated suspension with 12 months active.\" He was also ordered to pay over $24,600 in legal fees and expenses. Washington filed an appeal."

  "text" : "David Battle Turpie (* 8. Juli 1828 im Hamilton County, Ohio; † 21. April 1909 in Indianapolis) war ein US-amerikanischer Politiker (Demokratische Partei), der den Bundesstaat Indiana im US-Senat vertrat. David Turpie wuchs in Ohio auf und machte 1848 seinen Abschluss am Kenyon College in Gambier. Er studierte danach die Rechtswissenschaften und zog später nach Logansport in Indiana, wo er eine Anwaltskanzlei eröffnete. Dort wurde er dann auch als Mitglied der Demokraten politisch aktiv. Im Alter von 24 Jahren zog er 1852 in das Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana ein. Nach einer Legislaturperiode konzentrierte er sich wieder auf seine juristische Tätigkeit; so wurde er 1856 Richter am staatlichen Kreisgericht. 1858 folgte eine weitere Amtszeit im Parlament seines Staates. Im Januar 1863 wurde Turpie in den US-Senat gewählt. Er gewann bei einer Nachwahl das Mandat des aus dem Kongress ausgeschlossenen Jesse D. Bright, dem Illoyalität gegenüber der Union während des Sezessionskrieges vorgeworfen wurde. Allerdings war die Amtszeit bereits im März desselben Jahres wieder beendet. David Turpie wurde danach zunächst wieder juristisch tätig. 1872 zog er nach Indianapolis. Dort setzte er seine politische Laufbahn als Mitglied des staatlichen Repräsentantenhauses fort; von 1874 bis 1875 war er dessen Speaker. Zwischen 1886 und 1887 übte Turpie das Amt des Staatsanwalts für den Gerichtsdistrikt von Indiana aus. Schließlich erfolgte im Jahr 1887 seine zweite Wahl in den Senat in Washington. Er setzte sich gegen den späteren US-Präsidenten Benjamin Harrison durch und gehörte dem Kongress nach einer Wiederwahl bis 1899 an, ehe er dem Republikaner Albert J. Beveridge unterlag. Während seiner zwölf Jahre im Senat war Turpie unter anderem Vorsitzender des Volkszählungsausschusses. Von 1898 bis 1899 stand er der demokratischen Senatsfraktion als Chairman vor. Politisch setzte er sich unter anderem für eine Volksabstimmung zur Aufnahme Hawaiis in die Vereinigten Staaten ein."

  "text" : "Deborah L. Ruggiero (born April 2, 1958), commonly known as Deb Ruggiero, is an American radio personality and politician from Jamestown, Rhode Island. A Democrat, she serves in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, representing the 74th district, which contains all of Jamestown and part of Middletown. Ruggiero was first elected in November 2008 and took office on January 6, 2009. In 2008, Ruggiero challenged 28-year incumbent Bruce J. Long (R–Middletown) for the 74th district seat. Long, a Republican, was the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives and was seeking his fifteenth term. In the election held on November 4, 2008, Ruggiero defeated Long by 54% to 46%, carrying each of the district's six precincts. She was re-elected in 2010, winning 53% in a three-way race. Her Republican and Independent opponents took 31% and 16% of the vote respectively. Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Ruggiero went to high school in Lincoln, Rhode Island before attending Boston College, graduating magna cum laude with a double major in English and Communications. She has spent her career in the media, working first for CBS radio in Boston, then for FOX TV and WPRI-TV for 8 years. Since 2000, she has served as Director of Community and Business Development at Citadel Radio, the owners of WPRO and WPRO-FM. Since 1992, she has also taught a class in Broadcast Advertising at Providence College. A supporter of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, Ruggiero attended the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver as an alternate. Ruggiero is lesbian; her partner of 22 and a half years, Joyce Ioanes, died of cancer in 2007. She is one of four openly LGBT members of the Rhode Island General Assembly, alongside Rep. Gordon D. Fox (D–Providence), Rep. Frank Ferri (D–Warwick) and Sen. Donna Nesselbush (D–Pawtucket)."

Andrews, who is gay, was born in Orange and still lives there with her partner Candi Fetzer. Andrews earned a bachelor's degree from UMass Amherst and an MBA from Xavier University before embarking on a 25-year career with Procter & Gamble (P&G). Her first P&G positions were in Quincy, Massachusetts and she later moved to the company's headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. She left P&G in 2006 after four years as the company's global diversity & inclusion manager. She then established her own consulting business, Legacy Unlimited. Following incumbent state representative Chris Donelan's announcement that he would run for Franklin County sheriff rather than seek re-election in 2010, Andrews launched a bid to succeed him in the state house. In the Democratic primary election held on September 14, 2010, Andrews polled 37% in a five candidate race, finishing 519 votes ahead of the second-place finisher, who took 24%. In the general election held on November 2, she polled 6,885 (53%), finishing over 1,300 votes ahead of the Republican nominee (who took 42%) and an independent (on 5%). She first took office on January 5, 2011. She was defeated for re-election by Republican Susannah Whipps Lee in November 2014; her term will end January 7, 2015."

  "text" : "Dennis T. Gorski (born July 20, 1944) is a politician in New York and a former Marine. A resident of Cheektowaga, New York, Gorski is a former County Executive of Erie County, New York, which includes Buffalo, New York and many of its suburbs. He was the first Democrat elected Erie County Executive and the first Erie County Executive elected to three four-year terms. Gorski was an Erie County Legislator and a member of the New York State Assembly prior to three-term service as county executive. During his second term as County Executive, he ran for Congress to succeed Democrat Henry Nowak, but he was defeated in the general election by Republican Jack Quinn. Like many Buffalo Democrats, including Buffalo Mayors Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, Gorski was known for being more conservative than the mainstream Democratic Party platform, and was regularly cross-endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York. As county executive, he rivaled his contemporary Buffalo Mayors and on some issues his contemporary New York State Governors in power: He succeeded in bringing the World University Games to Buffalo, and since the National Football League Buffalo Bills play in suburban Orchard Park, New York it was his responsibility to broker a deal to keep the team from leaving town. He also helped the National Hockey League Buffalo Sabres finance Marine Midland Arena (now known as First Niagara Center). During his early years he brought about economic recovery and kept the county on solid financial footing during his tenure. He has been described as the only County Executive to balance the budget. Gorski is a Vietnam War veteran and remained active in Veteran's affairs while in office. Since leaving the county executive's office, he has worked in private business in Buffalo, New York. Gorski spent his first nine years of public life working for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) and was subsequently was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo."

Benson's running mate for governor was former state House minority leader Ethan Berkowitz; they lost in the general election to the Republican ticket of Sean Parnell and Mead Treadwell by 22% of the vote. In March 2007, Benson filed in Alaska to make her second bid for the U.S. House of Representatives, but was defeated in the August 2008 Democratic primary by Ethan Berkowitz--the same person with whom she ran on the 2010 governor-lieutenant governor ticket--who was that year a \"Red to Blue\" candidate supported by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Benson ran for Alaska governor in 2002 and for the U.S. House in 2006."

  "text" : "Donald Howard Yarborough (December 15, 1925 - September 23, 2009), was a liberal Democratic politician who was reportedly the first Southern politician to endorse the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Yarborough, an attorney in Houston, Texas, ran for governor of Texas in 1962, 1964, and 1968. In 1962, he came close to winning the primary runoff election against John B. Connally, Jr., having polled 49 percent of the ballots. Other intraparty rivals, considered conservatives, included the state attorney general, Will Wilson, highway commissioner Marshall Formby, and General Edwin A. Walker, who made anticommunism the centerpiece of his race. The Republican gubernatorial nominee, Jack Cox, an oil equipment executive from Houston, was also a strong conservative and a former Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives. Although Yarborough never became governor, his campaigns contributed strongly to the reform of the Texas Democratic Party, uniting, behind Yarborough's candidacy, traditional New Deal loyalists, organized labor, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and reform-seeking liberals, thereby enabling this coalition to capture local constituencies in the Texas House and Senate and build organizations later drawn upon by Mark White and Ann Richards. Yarborough was born in New Orleans on December 15, 1925. His father was the president of a bank in New Orleans that went bust in the Great Depression, so Don was sent temporarily to spend part of his boyhood living with an aunt in Mississippi, where he helped out picking cotton in the fields of his family’s farm with the laborers. His father eventually got a job with the government and moved the family to Washington, D.C. His family also spent time during the years after the Depression living with relatives in Coral Gables, Florida. The family eventually moved together to Houston when he was 12. His mother, Inez Black Yarborough, served as head of the Women in Yellow volunteer corps at the Jefferson Davis Hospital in Houston. Upon graduating from San Jacinto High School at 17, Yarborough enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, entered officer’s training school and became a Company Commander at the age of 19. He served one year in China at the close of World War II. After the war, Yarborough entered the University of Texas, where he belonged to Kappa Alpha fraternity, and worked part-time to supplement the money he received under the G.I. bill. He earned his law degree in 1950. Yarborough re-entered the Marine Corps to serve during the Korean War as a member of the Judge Advocate General’s Corp (JAG Corps). He then returned to Texas to found his own law firm and take part in civic affairs. In 1956, as president of the Houston Junior Chamber of Commerce, Yarborough won the national debating championship for the organization due to his passionate speaking skills. In 1960, Yarborough married his first wife, Katherine Edwards. In 1963, Yarborough was named by LIFE magazine as one of the 100 young Americans who were \"distinguished by their dedication to something larger than private success, because they had the courage to act against old problems, the boldness to try out new ideas, and a hard-bitten, undaunted hopefulness about man. In his first run for political office, Yarborough ran for Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1960. In 1962, he ran for the first time for governor, and in a field of five Democratic candidates, he reached a run-off with John Connally and came within 28,000 votes of winning the nomination, a nationally-noted near-upset in a state long dominated by the conservative faction of the Democratic Party. He ran for governor again in 1964 and 1968. In political life he supported civil rights, economic justice, environmental protection, and women's equality, and he challenged the big business establishment that had long dominated Texas politics. After leaving politics, Yarborough promoted science as a means to ease suffering and cure aging, which he considered to be a disease that affected everyone. He worked as a lobbyist for Paraplegia Cure Research in Washington, D.C., where lived for many years on Capitol Hill and in Mclean, Va. He also played a role in the Council for a Livable World and was a founding member of biotech research companies. Yarborough died of Parkinson's disease on September 23, 2009. Yarborough was married three times, to Katherine Edwards Yarborough in 1960, to Gail Lind in 1978, and Houston realtor Charity O'Connell Yarborough in 1984."

In 2006, Duncan was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the Maryland gubernatorial election. He abruptly dropped out of the race on June 22, 2006, citing clinical depression, handing the nomination to Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley. Following his exit from the gubernatorial race, he was appointed Vice President of Administrative Affairs of the University of Maryland, College Park, where he worked for 17 months. In 2014 he unsuccessfully ran for his old job as Montgomery County Executive. He lost to incumbent Ike Leggett in the Democratic Party primary."

Prior to entering politics, Perez worked as a community organizer. Perez served as the first Mayor who was also the CEO of the city and was widely credited with reducing crime, reforming the school system and sparking economic revitalization in the city. Perez's investment in educational reform and appointment of new leadership at the Board of Education led to significant increases in high school graduation rates in the city. On July 14th, 2016 The Connecticut Supreme Court upheld  the December 9, 2013 decision of the Connecticut Appellate Court overturning Perez's state court conviction on bribery, fabricating evidence, and conspiracy to fabricate evidence in connection with the failed development of a vacant site and improvements to his home by a city contractor, and vacated his sentence."

  "text" : "Edward Allen Hannegan (* 25. Juni 1807 im Hamilton County, Ohio; † 25. Februar 1859 in St. Louis, Missouri) war ein US-amerikanischer Politiker der Demokratischen Partei, der den Bundesstaat Indiana in beiden Kammern des Kongresses vertrat. Noch im Jahr von Edward Hannegans Geburt zogen seine Eltern mit ihm ins Bourbon County im Staat Kentucky. Dort besuchte er die öffentlichen Schulen, studierte die Rechtswissenschaften und arbeitete als Lehrer sowie als landwirtschaftliche Hilfskraft. 1827 wurde er dann in die Anwaltskammer aufgenommen, woraufhin er nach Indiana umzog. Er lebte dort zunächst in Vincennes und Terre Haute, ehe er sich dauerhaft in Covington niederließ und dort als Jurist zu praktizieren begann. Politisch betätigte er sich in seiner neuen Heimat ebenfalls. Von 1832 bis 1833 saß er im Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana, in das er später von 1841 bis 1842 noch einmal zurückkehrte. Zwischen dem 4. März 1833 und dem 3. März 1837 gehörte Hannegan dem Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten in Washington, D.C. an. Nachdem er in der Folge zunächst wieder als Jurist in Indiana gearbeitet hatte, zog er schließlich am 4. März 1843 in den US-Senat ein, wo er bis zum 3. März 1849 verblieb. Da ihn seine Partei nicht erneut nominierte, musste er nach einer Amtsperiode wieder aus dem Kongress ausscheiden. Während seiner Zeit im Senat war er unter anderem Vorsitzender des Committee on Private Land Claims. Vom 30. Juni 1849 bis zum 13. Januar 1850 fungierte Edward Hannegan als Gesandter der Vereinigten Staaten in Preußen. Nach seiner Rückkehr war er wieder als Jurist in Covington tätig, bis er 1857 nach St. Louis umzog. Dort starb er zwei Jahre darauf an einer Überdosis Morphium."

  "text" : "Edward Joseph Kelly (May 1, 1876 – October 20, 1950) served as chief engineer of the Chicago Sanitary District in the 1920s, and later as mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1933–1947); he was a Democrat. Born to Stephen and Helen (née Lang) Kelly, he was the first of five Chicago mayors from Bridgeport of Chicago's South Side. Kelly was the chief engineer of the Chicago Sanitary District in the 1920s. He was sponsored by Patrick Nash, the owner of a sewer-contracting company that did millions of dollars of business with the city. He subsequently became president of the South Park Board, a position that presided over the building of Soldier Field. Under his tenure Soldier Field cost $8 million, while a similar Los Angeles stadium only cost $1.7 million. Kelly was Mayor of Chicago during the 1933-34 Chicago World's Fair (Century of Progress) which took place during the Great Depression which included the successful playing of the first official Major League Baseball All-Star Game; Kelly initiated for holding a major sport event for the fair to the Chicago Tribune. Kelly was famous for banning Nelson Algren's 1942 book Never Come Morning, a novel, from the Chicago Public Library; the ban remained in force for decades due to the outcry by Chicago Polonia upon its release. Following the assassination of Mayor Anton Cermak, Kelly was hand-picked by his friend, Patrick Nash, Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party, for the mayoral election of 1933. Together, Kelly and Nash built one of the most powerful, and most corrupt, big city political organizations, called the \"Kelly-Nash Machine\". In 1947, Kelly acquiesced to the Cook County Democratic Party's decision to slate a candidate with reform credentials for mayor of Chicago and was succeeded by Martin H. Kennelly."

He took up law in 1830, passed the bar exam, and in 1837 he practiced in Tennessee and Mississippi with rebel General Simon B. Buckner. In 1838, he moved to Buffalo where he became one of the leading criminal lawyers. He married around 1838, but his wife died soon after; he re-married in 1843, to Sarah L. He was appointed city attorney in 1845, and again in 1851. He was elected mayor on March 1, 1853, as the Democratic candidate. During his term the city charter was revised to make the mayor's term two years and the Common Council would elect its own presiding officer; the mayor would no longer be president. Additionally, many of the city offices that were filled by Council appointment were now to be elective. The charter also annexed Black Rock into the city of Buffalo. He was reelected for a second term on November 8, 1853, as the first two-year Buffalo mayor, and the first mayor to serve consecutive terms. After serving as mayor he returned to his law practice. He died on February 25, 1865, and was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery."

  "text" : "Elihu Emory Jackson (November 3, 1837 – December 27, 1907), a member of the United States Democratic Party, was the 41st Governor of Maryland in the United States from 1888 to 1892. He was born in 1837 in Delmar, Maryland and died in 1907 in the City of Baltimore, Maryland. He is buried at the Parsons Cemetery in Salisbury, Maryland, the county seat of Wicomico County. He was part owner of Pemberton Hall, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Governor Jackson is also known as having attended the ceremonies at Gettysburg Battlefield in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from the largest military battle on the North American continent in July 1863, dedicating several regimental and battle monuments for engagements participated in by the Union Army (United States Army), and even visiting some already erected and privately funded Confederate States Army monuments, and showing equanimity towards both sides with several regiments of Maryland troops in both armies, including regiments from the former pre-war State Militia. During the ceremonies and travels through the battlefield areas, he and his staff carried a revived Maryland state flag incorporating the shield from the coats-of-arms of the old colonial proprietary family of the Calverts and Crosslands, with both the black/gold chevrons of the paternal Calvert family and the red/white colors of the split bottony crosses (trefoil) of the maternal Crossland family. The ancestral parents of the first Lord Baltimore, Sir George Calvert, (1579–1632), the first Baron Baltimore (Lord Baltimore) who originally received the granting charter in 1632 from King Charles I of England for the new third English colony and Province of Maryland, which after his sudden death, was transferred to his eldest son and heir, Cecilius Calvert, [1605-1675], (the second Baron Baltimore and Lord Baltimore) who then became the first Lord Proprietor of the Colony while still living in England. It was he who sent the first two ships (the \"Ark\" and the \"Dove\") to the shores of the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay with colonists who first briefly visited Virginia further south, then landed in March 1634, established the new capital St. Mary's City, under his younger brother Leonard Calvert, (1606–1647), as the first colonial governor. By the end of the 19th century, carrying the old colonial armorial bearings from the shield emblazoned on a newly revived state flag, now seemed symbolic of the revival of reconciliation and sense of moving forward in the state so deeply torn asunder during the recent Civil War. There are several photographs of the Governor and his staff arrayed in front of several of the Maryland military monuments at Gettysburg, dressed in military uniforms and with the new state flag prominently posted alongside. It was officially adopted in 1904 as the state flag by act of the General Assembly of Maryland in the historic 18th-century Maryland State House in the later state capital of Annapolis."

  "text" : "Frank Albert Sedita (June 20, 1907 – May 2, 1975) was Mayor of the City of Buffalo, New York, serving 1958–1961 and 1966–1973. He was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on June 20, 1907. The family moved to Buffalo in 1911, and when he was 10, Sedita began work by hawking newspapers and shining shoes around the downtown area. He attended Hutchinson Central High School and spent his summers working in canning factories and on farms in Wilson and Lyndonville, New York. He received a B.A. from Canisius College, and in 1931 received his law degree from the University of Buffalo Law School. He married Sarah Vacanti on July 11, 1934. In 1950, Sedita was elected as a City Court judge. He resigned from his job on the City Court bench on September 6, 1957 to pursue his mayoral bid. On November 5, 1957, he was elected mayor, defeating incumbent Steven Pankow. During this term, urban renewal was continued and the Ellicott District Project was completed. He lost his bid for re-election to mayor in the November 7, 1961 election, when Chester A. Kowal was elected mayor. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy nominated Sedita to the post of Federal Customs Collector for the Port of Buffalo; he held that post until May 7, 1965. He was elected as mayor to a second term on November 2, 1965. At the 1966 Democratic State Convention, held in Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, he was nominated to run for New York State Attorney General. He was defeated in the general election by Louis Lefkowitz. In June 1967, during the Buffalo riot at the Michigan Avenue YMCA, the mayor faced an angry crowd of young African Americans during an East Side street confrontation. He was re-elected on November 4, 1969. He ran for Erie County executive in 1971, but was defeated by Edward V. Regan in the general election. Because of health concerns, on February 8, 1973 Sedita submitted a letter of resignation to the Buffalo Common Council, to become effective on March 5, 1973. He died on May 2, 1975, aged 67, and was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery. On December 14, 1987, Buffalo Public School 38 was renamed Frank A. Sedita Community School. Sedita's son, Frank A. Sedita, Jr., was a judge on the New York State Supreme Court, and his grandson, Frank A. Sedita III, is a judge on the New York State Supreme Court"

Prior to serving as mayor, Eggers had served as a city and county judge, spent four years as personal secretary to Mayor Hague, and served on the city commission in Jersey City. Eggers was a delegate to the New Jersey Constitutional Convention of 1947, and signatory of the resulting New Jersey State Constitution. He later served as a director of the New Jersey State Bar Association. Eggers died of a cerebral hemorrhage on July 8, 1954, at the age of 53. His wake was held at the Quinn funeral home which operated in the Van Wagenen House. His uncle, Hague, was served with a subpeona during the event. Eggers was interred at Holy Name Cemetery."

  "text" : "Frank Hague (January 17, 1876 – January 1, 1956) was an American Democratic Party politician who served as the mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey from 1917 to 1947, Democratic National Committeeman from New Jersey from 1922 until 1949, and Vice-Chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1924 until 1949. Hague has a widely known reputation for corruption and bossism and has been called \"the grandaddy of Jersey bosses.\" By the time he left office in 1947, he enjoyed palatial homes, European vacations, and a private suite at the Plaza Hotel. His wealth has been estimated to have been over $10 million at the time of his death, although his City salary never exceeded $8,500 per year and he had no other legitimate source of income. His desk, according to legend, had a specially designed lap drawer which could be pushed outward towards the person with whom he was meeting. This allowed his \"guests\" to discreetly deliver bribes in the form of envelopes containing large amounts of cash. However, according to New Jersey preservationist John Hallinan, the drawers were a traditional feature of 19th century partners desks and that \"[t]he last thing [Hague] would need to do is take a bribe personally.\" As of September 2013, the desk was in storage awaiting restoration. During the height of his power Hague's political machine, known as \"the organization,\" was one of the most powerful in the United States controlling politics on local, county, and state levels. Hague's personal influence extended to the national level, influencing federal patronage  and presidential campaigns."

  "text" : "Frank Logue (August 18, 1924 – December 31, 2010) was the 25th mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, serving from 1976 to 1979. His mother was widowed, leaving her to support five children during the Great Depression on a kindergarten teacher's salary. Frank Logue and his three brothers all attended Yale University, where, after Pearl Harbor, they enlisted in the military reserves. Frank Logue was called to active duty in 1943, served as an infantry soldier in France, and returned to Yale, graduating in 1948, and going on to attend Yale Law School. In the Spring of 1947, Frank Logue served as President of the Yale Political Union. Logue entered politics in Trumbull, Connecticut in 1953, becoming a Democratic district leader, then a prosecutor, and then town attorney. He ran for state representative in 1960, and lost. He served in the Kennedy administration as a part-time staff person for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. At age 40 he moved his family to New Haven, where he organized and directed an institute to train community organizers and neighborhood workers in the War on Poverty. He later created and directed \"National Urban Fellows\", an urban leadership development program for minorities and women. He was subsequently elected to the New Haven Board of Aldermen, representing the city's 18th Ward for two two-year terms, from 1972 to 1975. Bucking the New Haven Democratic party machine, he ran as a liberal reform candidate against the party's candidate, incumbent Bart Guida, in the 1975 mayoral primary and went on to win the primary and the general election. He took office as mayor on January 1, 1976. Logue ran as the standard bearer of liberal reformers looking to topple the party machine overseen by Guida’s patron, the late party Chairman Arthur Barbieri. It was a heady campaign; key workers included future Congresswoman, Rosa DeLauro; presidential adviser, Stan Greenberg; and state judge, Thayer Baldwin. Once in office, Logue had the luck of presiding over the city during a period of national urban decline. Employers, retailers, and middle-class families finished a suburban exodus from New Haven that began during the heady “Model City” urban renewal period that saw a record amount of federal and foundation dollars pour into the city, only to leave it poorer. In the late 1970s, much of downtown was boarded up and a general malaise had settled over the city. Logue was an early advocate of historic preservation, an antidote to the destruction of so much of the city’s landscape during urban renewal. Logue also believed the arts could help revitalize the city. He came up with the original idea of reviving the Shubert theater as part of a downtown arts renaissance, an idea his successor put into action along with an emphasis on preservation. Logue started the process of reviving downtown with the rehabilitation of the old Taft Hotel. Logue also helped push the state to create the PILOT (payments in lieu of taxes) program for cities. He won renomination in the September 1977 primary by a margin of 243 votes over challenger Biagio DiLieto and was re-elected to a second term in November of that year. However, he lost the primary to DiLieto in his bid for a third two-year term in 1979. Frank Logue's brother Edward, a Yale Law School graduate who married the daughter of William DeVane, dean of Yale College, was an influential city planner who was Mayor Lee's right-hand man on most administrative matters. After leaving the mayor's office, Logue was an active civic volunteer in New Haven and worked as a labor arbitrator and as a consultant to organizations including the Ford Foundation. He died in Hamden, Connecticut, on December 31, 2010."

He was elected mayor of Buffalo on November 6, 1855, as the Democratic candidate. During his term, the city undertook an extensive program of street, sidewalk, and street light improvements. He is credited as the originator of Buffalo's street railway system, and was one of the first people to actively campaign for an international bridge between Buffalo and Canada.

  "text" : "George Henry Williams (March 26, 1823 – April 4, 1910) was an American judge and politician. He served as Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, was the 32nd Attorney General of the United States, and was elected Oregon's U.S. Senator, and served one term. Williams, as U.S. Senator, authored and supported legislation that allowed the U.S. military to be deployed in Reconstruction southern states to allow for an orderly process of readmittance into the United States. Williams was the first presidential Cabinet member to be appointed from the Pacific Coast. As attorney general under President Ulysses S. Grant, Williams continued the prosecutions that shut down the Ku Klux Klan. He had to contend with controversial election disputes in Reconstructed southern states. President Grant and Williams legally recognized P. B. S. Pinchback as the first African American state governor. Williams ruled that the Virginius, a gun-running ship captured by Spain during the Virginius Affair, did not have the right to bear the U.S. flag. However, he argued that Spain did not have the right to execute American crew members. Nominated for Supreme Court Chief Justice by President Grant, Williams failed to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate primarily due to Williams' removal of A. C. Gibbs United States District Attorney at Portland, Oregon. In 1875, Williams resigned as U.S. Attorney General under the controversy of his wife allegedly taking payment money from the custom house firm Pratt & Boyd in order to drop litigation by the U.S. Justice Department. After his resignation, Williams took part in counting Florida ballots for Rutherford B. Hayes in settling the controversial presidential election of 1876. Williams returned to Oregon, resumed private law practice, and was elected Portland's mayor, serving two terms from 1902 to 1905. Williams advocated women's suffrage and that marriage and divorce proceedings needed to be handled by the civil courts rather than the church. Williams, at the age of 83, was indicted while Mayor of Portland for not enforcing gambling restriction statutes; he was acquitted and served out the rest of his term as mayor. On May 28, 1905, Mayor Williams made a speech at the opening ceremony of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. Williams was the second to last surviving cabinet member of the Grant Administration."

  "text" : "George J. Zimmermann (1882–1938) was Mayor of the City of Buffalo, New York, serving 1934–1937. He was born in Buffalo on June 19, 1882. He joined his father's lumber business, eventually becoming a partner. He married Gertrude Cochrane in 1923. During the mayoral campaign, Zimmermann travelled to New York City and Washington, D.C. and secured almost $6,000,000 worth of construction to be financed with federal funds for the Fillmore-Lovejoy sewer project and Kensington High School. He was elected mayor on November 8, 1933, as the Democratic candidate. On April 18, 1936, formal charges were filed against Zimmermann to Governor Herbert H. Lehman charging 20 alleged counts of official misconduct. Included were Zimmermann's part in the sewage disposal project and the reported \"deal\" with former Mayor Schwab. A grand jury indicted him. On May 1, 1936 he was arraigned, and returned to work the following day. After his term he returned to private life. He was once again indicted on March 14, 1938, by a grand jury related to his alleged activity regarding Buffalo 's $15,000,000 sewer project. A New York Supreme Court jury returned guilty verdicts on six of the nine counts charged against him. While awaiting the decision from his appeal, he died on September 14, 1938, and was buried in Mt. Calvary Cemetery in Cheektowaga, New York."

Il est le petit-neveu de George Clinton (1739-1812), gouverneur de New York et vice-président en 1804, et le fils de DeWitt Clinton (1769-1828), sénateur de New York et maire de la ville. Il étudie à Albany puis la médecine auprès de Theodric Romeyn Beck (1791-1855) au Fairfield Medical School et manifeste un fort intérêt pour la botanique. En février 1828, son père meurt brutalement. Il s’oriente alors vers des études de droit auprès de John Canfield Spencer (1788-1855) et est admis au barreau en 1831. L’année suivante, il se marie avec la fille de John Spencer, Laura Catherine, union dont naîtra neuf enfants. Il s’installe à Buffalo en 1836. Clinton y fonde un cabinet d’avocat et participe à l’organisation d’une délégation locale du parti démocrate. Il participe à la campagne de Martin Van Buren (1782-1862) en 1838. En 1842, il est élu maire de Buffalo. En 1852, il devient président du conseil de l’université de Buffalo. En 1861, il fonde la Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences avec Coleman Townsend Robinson (1838-1872). Clinton la dirige durant vingt ans. Sa collection de plante est conservé par la Société qu’il a créée, sous le nom d’herbier Clinton. Il part pour Albany en 1882 afin de s’occuper de l’édition des documents laissé par son grand-oncle George Clinton."

  "text" : "Geraldine \"Gerri\" Whittington (September 11, 1931 – January 24, 1993) was the personal executive secretary to President Lyndon B. Johnson, and was the first African-American secretary in the White House. Johnson was famous for working long hours and insisting his assistants worked long hours as well. When John F. Kennedy was assassinated and Johnson became president, he requested a new slate of secretaries. He saw Whittington working in a government office, and requested that his \"special assistant\" Jack Valenti get her home phone number. Johnson called her unannounced one evening, and requested that she come in that night for an interview. According to audiotapes of Johnson's phone calls, Whittington at first thought the call was a joke, but came to believe that it really was the president on the line. She applied for the job and was offered the position. Having a black woman in the White House was very unusual in the early 1960s. Johnson wanted to advertise the fact that he'd hired a black woman, but chose not to call a news conference. Instead, he arranged for Whittington to appear on the television game show \"What's My Line?\", wherein contestants attempted to guess her profession. This may have seemed less overt, but probably exposed her to more viewers than if a standard press conference had been held. Whittington appeared on episode #696 of the game show What's My Line? on January 19, 1964. She was the first contestant. The mystery guest that evening was Van Heflin and the panel consisted of Arlene Francis, Steve Allen, Dorothy Kilgallen and Bennett Cerf. After Whittington signed the blackboard as \"Jerri Whittington,\" she told host John Daly that she was from West River, Maryland. Whittington's occupation was shown on the screen as \"Secretary to President Johnson.\" After her game, she described President Lyndon Johnson with the following words, \"great warmth, fair, kind, a perfectionist.\" Later Whittington appeared in several magazines, including Jet and Sepia. She was the first person to learn that Justice Thurgood Marshall had been nominated by President Johnson to the Supreme Court. Minutes before LBJ made the official announcement, he took his nominee down to her office and said, \"Here's the next Supreme Court Justice!\" She told friends that she thanked the President for making the choice of the first Black court justice. After suffering a stroke at age 38, Ms. Whittington died of cancer in Washington, DC, on January 24, 1993, on the same day as Justice Thurgood Marshall."

  "text" : "Gordon St. Angelo (June 20, 1927 - October 18, 2011) born in Huntingburg, Indiana, USA is former Democratic Party State Chairman of the state of Indiana and was a prominent politician during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Gordon was born on June 20, 1927 to George and Lillian (Salat) St. Angelo in Huntingburg, Indiana. He served in the Navy at the end of World War II. He then attended North Central College, where he was active in student politics. He there met his future wife Beatrice Mae Larson, who was from Watertown, South Dakota. Gordon became active in Democratic Party politics in 1954. He was elected Dubois County Chairman in 1958. An early key supporter of then Senator John F. Kennedy, he became 8th District Chairman in 1960. St. Angelo worked on two presidential campaigns including holding the position of National Co-Chairman of Humphrey for President Committee. He was also manager of Roger Branigin's successful campaign for the governorship of Indiana in 1964. After managing the campaign of Governor Roger D. Branigan in 1964, Gordon was elected state Democratic Party Chairman, a position he held until 1974. His tenure was longer than that of any party chairman in Indiana. From 1974 to 1996, he was Vice-President of Community Development for the Lilly Endowment, and during this time was a vocal proponent for the development of free market economies in North and South America. Gordon's political reach extended beyond the state. He was Deputy Democratic Party National Chairman from June to November, 1968, when he helped manage the Hubert Humphrey presidential campaign. In 1974 Gordon left politics to become Senior Program Officer of community development at the Lilly Endowment, where he loved working for twenty three years. There he was instrumental in expanding the role of non-profits in public policy, with many positive civil- and individual-rights implications. His building of coalitions between non-profit think tanks was instrumental in the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 1973, he ran for National Democratic Party chairman, being narrowly defeated by Larry O'Brien. Gordon also served on the boards of the University of Indianapolis (1965-1993), St. Meinrad College, WFYI, the United Way, the Welfare Service League, the State Employment Commission, the Indiana Division of the National Civil Rights Commission, and the Indianapolis 500 Festival Committee. Starting with his work at the Lilly Endowment, Gordon and Beatty took special interest in historic New Harmony, Indiana which they visited often. He was appointed by Governor Evan Bayh to the New Harmony Commission and served on the board of the Robert Lee Blaffer Foundation until his death (Chairman, 1995-2006). He received honorary doctorates from the University of Indianapolis and the University of Southern Indiana. He received \"Sagamore of the Wabash\" awards for his service to Indiana from Governors Welsh, Branigan, Whitcomb, Bowen, Orr, Bayh and Daniels. In 1996, St. Angelo helped create a foundation with Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman and his wife, Rose Friedman to promote and help establish educational choice in America. He served as President & CEO of the Milton and Rose D. Friedman Foundation for School Choice until 2009. He was succeeded by Robert Enlow. Though he started his career in the Democratic party, he was a supporter of many Republican candidates since the mid-seventies. For example, he endorsed Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, a Republican, for both of his gubernatorial campaigns. St. Angelo died on October 18, 2011 in Indianapolis, Indiana."

  "text" : "Grace Tully (9 August 1900 – 15 June 1984) was private secretary to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). Grace Tully was born on 9 August 1900 in Bayonne, New Jersey. Her father was a businessman and a loyalist to the Democratic Party. He died when she was young, and Tully and her two sisters and brother were raised by their mother. She received her secretarial education at the Grace Institute in New York, and after graduating was appointed as secretary to Patrick Hayes, bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. In 1928, Grace Tully started to work for the Democratic National Committee, and was assigned to assist Eleanor Roosevelt, who was organizing support for presidential nominee Al Smith. Later that year, when FDR was nominated for Governor of New York, Grace Tully went to work on his staff. After Roosevelt's successful election, Tully began serving as the assistant to Missy LeHand, who was Roosevelt's personal secretary in Roosevelt's office at Albany, New York. Tully was given the dictation and typing duties that Lehand disliked. Tully served with FDR for his four years as governor. Grace Tully moved to Washington, D.C., in 1933, when Roosevelt was elected President. Both she and Missy LeHand were important figures for FDR during his presidency. Tully frequently accompanied FDR on his trips to Hyde Park and Shangri-La (today called Camp David). When Missy LeHand suffered a stroke in 1941, Grace Tully took over her position as personal secretary to the President. Tully was not an intimate or romantic companion for Roosevelt in the same way as LeHand had been. She continued working for the President until his death in April 1945 at his \"Little White House\" in Warm Springs, where she was present as he died. Then she served as the Executive Secretary for the FDR Foundation. In 1949 she published her memoirs, FDR: My Boss. In 1955 she joined the staff of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, working with Lyndon B. Johnson, the Senate Majority Leader at the time. She retired ten years later and died in 1984."

  "text" : "Albert Benjamin \"Happy\" Chandler, Sr. (July 14, 1898 – June 15, 1991) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Kentucky. He represented the state in the U.S. Senate and served as its 44th and 49th governor. Aside from his political positions, he also served as the second Commissioner of Baseball from 1945 to 1951 and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. His grandson, Ben Chandler, later served as congressman for Kentucky's Sixth District. A multi-sport athlete during his college days at Transylvania College, Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems. Convinced that he was destined to become President of the United States, Chandler challenged Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley for his U.S. Senate seat in 1938. During the campaign, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the state to campaign for Barkley, and Chandler lost a close race. The following year, Kentucky's other senator, Marvel Mills Logan, died in office, and Chandler resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the vacant seat. A fiscal conservative and disciple of Virginia's Harry F. Byrd, Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt's New Deal and openly disagreed with the president's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific. In 1945, Chandler resigned his senate seat to succeed the late Kenesaw Mountain Landis as commissioner of baseball. His most significant action as commissioner was the approval of Jackie Robinson's contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers, effectively integrating Major League Baseball. He also established the first pension fund for Major League players, earning him the title \"the players' commissioner\". Baseball owners were upset with Chandler's governance, however, and did not renew his contract in 1951. Following his term as commissioner, Chandler returned to Kentucky and won a second term as governor in 1955. The major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing the integration of the state's public schools and establishing a medical school at the University of Kentucky which was later named the Chandler Medical Center in his honor. Following his second term as governor, his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963, 1967, and 1971. His endorsement of dark-horse candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson was seen as critical to Wilkinson's successful gubernatorial campaign in 1988. Wilkinson later resisted calls to remove Chandler from the University of Kentucky board of trustees following Chandler's use of a racial epithet during a board meeting in 1988. Chandler died June 15, 1991, a month before his ninety-third birthday. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former Kentucky governor."

  "text" : "Helen Shiller (born 1947) is a former Alderman of the 46th ward in Chicago, Illinois. She served in the Chicago City Council for six four-year terms, from 1987 to 2011. Shiller was elected to the City Council on her third attempt, as Harold Washington, Chicago's first black Mayor, was re-elected to his second term, and her election as alderman helped close the Council Wars era in Chicago government. Shiller has been described as \"committed to liberal causes\" appropriate for the lakefront district she represents. Among her most significant impacts on Chicago were her advocacy for diverse, inclusive, affordable housing and helping craft Chicago's response to the HIV/AIDS crisis. Her commitment to fostering community development without displacement often brought Shiller into contention with some constituencies, real estate developers, and editorial boards. Shiller's oral history was collected by Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Uptown resident, the late Studs Terkel, in his 2003 book, Hope Dies Last."

  "text" : "Henry J. \"Buddy\" Cianfrani (March 19, 1923 – July 3, 2002) was the Pennsylvania state senator for the first district. Prior to holding elective office, he served in the U.S. Army during World War II where he earned the Purple Heart and the Silver Star. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1956 and 1960. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1963, where he served until his election to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1966. He eventually attained the chairmanship of the powerful Appropriations Committee from which position he worked closely with Speaker of the House Herbert Fineman to appropriate money to Philadelphia. In 1977, Cianfrani was convicted on federal charges of racketeering and mail fraud for padding his Senate payroll. His case was prosecuted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by U.S. attorney David W. Marston, who was later removed from the position by U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Cianfrani was sentenced to five years in federal prison. After serving for twenty-seven months, he was released in 1980. In the middle 1970s, he began dating political reporter Laura Foreman of The Philadelphia Inquirer. The two moved in together and she reportedly accepted money and gifts from him while she was still reporting on him for her newspaper. After the affair became public in 1977 she was fired by her employer, The New York Times. She and Cianfrani married in 1980, after his divorce from his first wife was finalized and he was released from federal prison. Years after his release, his political career enjoyed a resurgence. In 1988 Cianfrani won back his old position as Philadelphia ward leader and regained a measure of clout within Philadelphia politics. He was considered a mentor to many Philadelphia politicians, including Congressman Bob Brady and Senator Vince Fumo. Cianfrani died of a stroke in Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 3, 2002."

  "text" : "Herbert Romulus O'Conor (November 17, 1896 – March 4, 1960) was the 51st Governor of Maryland, serving from 1939 to 1947. He also served in the United States Senate, representing Maryland from 1947 to 1953. He was a Democrat. O'Conor was born in Baltimore, Maryland to James P. A. O'Conor and Mary Ann (Galvin) O'Conor. He received his B.A. degree from Loyola College and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1920. While in school, O'Conor was a reporter for the Baltimore Sun and Baltimore Evening Sun from 1919 to 1920. On November 24, 1920, O'Conor married Mary Eugenia Byrnes (1896–1971) and they had five children, Herbert R. Jr., Eugene F., James Patrick, Robert and Mary Patricia. From 1921 to 1922, O'Conor served as the assistant state's attorney for Baltimore. In 1923, he was elected State's Attorney of Baltimore City, and served there until he was elected as the Attorney General of Maryland in 1934. O'Conor also served in the National Association of Attorneys General in 1937. His secretary, Camilla Conroy, died in the burning of the luxury liner SS Morro Castle in 1934. O'Conor identified her body which was found face under close to the wreck site. O'Conor was elected as Governor of Maryland in 1938, defeating incumbent Republican governor Harry W. Nice. In doing so, he became the first Roman Catholic of Irish descent to serve in that position. As governor, O'Conor created the Maryland Council of Defense during the Second World War. He also worked towards improving the state transportation system, and worked towards the construction of new bridges over the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers. He also worked with other states to encourage inter-state cooperation, and served in positions including the Chairman of the Governor's Conference in 1941, and the President of the Council of State Government in 1943. Near the end of World War II, O'Conor sought to improve the effects of the War and founded the Commission on Post War Reconstruction and Development. He also sought to improve the Maryland healthcare system. O'Conor was elected to the United States Senate in 1946, but chose not to run for re-election in 1952. In the Senate, Hughes served as chairman of the Special Committee on Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce during the Eighty-first Congress. After his tenure in Senate, he continued the practice of law in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., until his death in Baltimore. He is interred in New Cathedral Cemetery."

  "text" : "Ilus Winfield Davis (April 22, 1917 – September 4, 1996) was mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, United States from 1963 to 1971. \"Ike\" Davis grew up on the east side of Kansas City and in 1933 was in the freshman class of the University of Kansas City which was to become the University of Missouri-Kansas City. He was instrumental in founding the student newspaper the University News. He was to get a law degree from the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri and served in the Army during World War II. Davis was elected Kansas City mayor by 1,810 votes in nearly 110,000 cast in 1963. He oversaw the bond issue to build Kansas City International Airport and pushed for construction of the Truman Sports Complex for the Kansas City Chiefs and eventually the Kansas City Royals. He dealt with labor strife during the construction of the two projects and the 1968 Kansas City riot following the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King. In April 1968 following the King assassination Davis met with a large group of inner city school students on the steps of City Hall. A police officer fired tear gas canister into the crowd and a riot erupted in which five were to die."

Born in Saco, Maine, Milliken moved to Chicago in 1837 and set up a blacksmith shop on Randolph Street. Here, Milliken taught himself law and was twice elected alderman and appointed an assistant county judge. In the election of 1854, Milliken defeated Amos Throop, who ran on the Temperance Party ticket, with nearly 60% of the vote. Although Throop was the temperance candidate, after winning the election, Milliken declared himself in favor of temperance as well. He ran for re-election the following year against Levi Boone, of the American Party and lost with 47% of the vote. Following his term as mayor, Milliken stayed in public service, becoming a police magistrate."

He is currently serving in his 3rd term in the Maryland State Senate, representing Maryland's District 42 in Baltimore County. In 2010 he was reelected as a Senator for another four years, the term of a Maryland Senator. During the 2010 campaign, he raised $344,316, had $131,245 on hand and spent $225,413 on his campaign, which was more than what James Rosapepe and Andrew (Andy) Harris spent on their campaigns. On his website, he calls himself Maryland's most independent Senator. In a letter on his homepage, signed with his name at the bottom he explains the reason he still serves on the General Assembly. He writes: \"Over the last 9 years, I have always voted my conscience placing my constituents’ best interests above anything else. As I promised 9 years ago, my votes have reflected fiscal conservatism combined with a great concern for protecting open space and saving the Chesapeake Bay. I continue to remain an independent thinker, placing policy before party.\""

  "text" : "James A. McClinton (born 1961) is a Kansas politician, originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and former mayor of Topeka, Kansas who served only a portion of his term from January 2004 to April 2005. He was appointed by the city council to replace Butch Felker, who resigned amid a campaign finance scandal (Duane Pomeroy served as acting mayor from November to December 2003). McClinton had previously served on the city council from 1991 to 1993 and from 1997 to 2001. He is a member of the Democratic Party. James McClinton was born in Milwaukee, then moved to Helena, Arkansas in early childhood, and then finally to Topeka. After graduating from Washburn Rural High School, he attended Washburn University where he received a Minor degree in psychology, an Associate's degree in mental health and a Bachelor's degree in criminal justice. He received his Master's degree in public administration from the University of Kansas with honors. McClinton's short stint as mayor is significant for its firsts and lasts. He was the first African-American mayor of Topeka and the first mayor to be appointed by the city council (he was chosen from a field of 40 candidates by the city council). However, he was also the last mayor to serve the city with full authority as the populace subsequently voted in a referendum for council-manager form of government in 2004 which stripped the mayor position of most of his or her powers. Instead, a new city manager and the city council would hold non-ceremonial power (the decision to include this initiative on the 2004 ballot was made prior to the appointment of McClinton, possibly in reaction to Felker's alleged abuses). In 2004, McClinton decided against running for a full term as a \"ceremonial\" mayor. During his time as mayor, Topeka celebrated its 150th anniversary. The city was also honored by a visit from George W. Bush, Stephen Breyer and John Kerry, celebrating the anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision which ended racial segregation in schools and the renovated Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site. Mayor McClinton created a large diverse group of community leaders and charged them to create a Riverfront Development Plan. He submitted that plan to the city council prior to leaving office. The Riverfront Plan was approved by the council, received approval by the Kansas Legislature, and signed into law by former Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius. Mayor McClinton created new community development strategies to revitalize the inner city, his new program received a Regional Award from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. McClinton, along with other national mayors collaborated with the White House to eradicate homelessness in 10 years. Through mayor McClinton's leadership, the City of Topeka was recognized with several \"Best Practices\" citations. Mayor McClinton created a partnership with the University of Kansas to forgive tuition for students who returned to the community and committed to community service. After leaving office in 2005, Mayor McClinton worked with a local developer in several states revitalizing inner cities. In 2007, Mayor McClinton moved to the Dallas area. McClinton is now CEO of McClinton Consulting and also manages two federally funded housing programs. McClinton is the father of two daughters, Jameika and Tawana."

  "text" : "Jerramiah T. Healy (born December 16, 1950) is a New Jersey based politician who served as the 48th mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey serving from 2004-2013. He ran for the unexpired term of the late Glenn D. Cunningham and was elected in November 2004. In the special election, he defeated Acting Mayor L. Harvey Smith. He was subsequently elected to a full term by a record landslide. Healy entered public service as an assistant prosecutor for the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office in 1977. From 1981 to 1991, he maintained a private law practice in Jersey City. He was appointed Chief Judge in the Jersey City Municipal Court in 1991, and was reappointed in 1995. In 1997, he ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Jersey City against Bret Schundler, who later ran for Governor of New Jersey against Jim McGreevey. Healy resumed his private law practice until 2004, when he was elected mayor. Healy lost to Councilman Steven Fulop for mayor in 2013."

Previously, Roth served as one of three members of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission from June 2007 through January 2009. He had been appointed to the seat by Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry. Prior to his statewide positions, Roth had served as an Oklahoma County Commissioner, a post to which he had been elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006. Born in Prairie Village, Kansas, Roth attended Shawnee Mission East High School, Kansas State University, and Oklahoma City University School of Law. He then went on to work as a Chief Deputy and Attorney to the Oklahoma County Commission and the Oklahoma County Clerk. Roth is openly gay and was the first ever openly LGBT person to hold a statewide elected office in Oklahoma. In his bid to serve out the last two years of the corporation commission term to which he'd been appointed, Roth was defeated 52%-48% by Republican Dana Murphy. Roth recently endorsed the MAPS 3 proposal on the December 8, 2009 ballot in Oklahoma City."

  "text" : "Joan V. Hartley is an American politician. Hartley, a Democrat, has been a state senator from Connecticut since 2001. Hartley, a resident of Waterbury, represents the western half of the city as well as its southern suburbs of Naugatuck and Prospect in the Connecticut Senate. Hartley was born in Waterbury and graduated from Elms College and received a M.A. from Trinity College. Prior to being elected to the Connecticut Senate, Hartley served as a Connecticut state representative representing the 73rd District from 1984 to 2000. Hartley's predecessor as a state representative was future Governor John G. Rowland. Perhaps as a result, Hartley is generally considered among the more conservative and bipartisan members of the Democratic caucus. In 2007 she was believed to be the sole holdout from the strategy of Senate President Donald E. Williams, Jr. to override Governor M. Jodi Rell's veto of a Democratic state bonding package. Rell had vetoed the package claiming it put the state too far into debt. Hartley opposed a billion dollar commitment to the Connecticut State University system and has been threatened with retribution from Democratic party leadership. On October 30 an agreement was reached between the Rell Administration, legislative Democratic leaders and Senator Hartley to resolve the bonding stalemate. The final bonding package was reduced by $400 million from the level vetoed by Rell and increased oversight was placed on funds for the Connecticut State University system. The Courant later reported that pressure was placed on fellow senators against Hartley by Senator Thomas Gaffey, who had an undisclosed intimate relationship with the lobbyist for the university system. In December 2008, Hartley was removed as the Chairman of the Higher Education Committee because of her independence and willingness to stand up to the Democratic leadership who was shielding Gaffey. In 2008, Hartley was one of three Democrats who supported Governor M. Jodi Rell's proposal for a Three Strikes Law against career violent criminals. In 2009, Hartley was the only Democrat in the State Senate that did not vote to override Governor M. Jodi Rell's veto of the Healthcare Partnership bill, thereby preventing the bill from becoming law. In 2011, Hartley and Paul Doyle were the only two Democrats to vote against transgender rights legislation."

  "text" : "Joe Natalio Baca (born January 23, 1947) is a U.S. Representative, last serving California's 43rd congressional district as a member of the Democratic Party. The district, numbered as the 42nd from 1999 to 2003, is located in southwestern San Bernardino County and includes Fontana, Rialto, Ontario and parts of the city of San Bernardino. After redistricting, he decided to run in the new, adjacent 35th congressional district, where he faced fellow Democrat Gloria Negrete McLeod (due to California's \"top two\" primary system). On November 6, 2012, Baca lost his seat by a margin of 55.7% to 44.3%. He ran again in 2014 but came fifth with 11.2%. He subsequently announced that he was running for Mayor of Fontana. He lost in a landslide and subsequently announced his retirement from politics. In June 2015, Baca switched his affiliation to the Republican Party, citing his \"core Christian\" and pro-business beliefs."

Ferriero, an attorney by profession, resides in Hackensack. In September 2008, Ferriero and an associate, Dennis Oury, were indicted by a federal grand jury on seven counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. On October 22, 2009, he was found guilty on three of the eight counts against him. On July 29, 2010 Ferriero's conviction was vacated by U.S. District Judge Stanley R. Chesler, citing a recent ruling by the United States Supreme Court narrowing the scope of \" honest services fraud\". Judge Chesler added \"what Mr. Ferriero had been charged with is not considered a crime\". However, in 2013, a federal grand jury once again indicted Joe Ferriero again on charges of bribery, kickback and shakedown schemes, including a plot to extort $1.7 million from a prior developer of the New Jersey Meadowlands retail and entertainment project now known as American Dream Meadowlands."

He was born July 13, 1833, in Albany, New York. When a child, he served as a page in the New York State Assembly and New York State Senate. He married Elizabeth House on January 14, 1856; after her death in 1894, in 1897 he married Marie Schrewnk. In 1860–1862, he was the Albany correspondent for the Brooklyn Eagle. Several years later, he moved to Buffalo and established his commission and malting businesses there. Manning was elected mayor in a special election held on January 9, 1883, as the Democratic candidate. He continued the string of vetoes begun by Mayor Grover Cleveland; they saved the city a great financial loss. Manning retired from politics after losing his campaign for re-election. He continued to grow and expand the malting business and built several grain elevators in the 1890s, each with a large storage capacity. On May 30, 1902, the largest fire Black Rock had ever seen consumed Manning's Frontier Canada plant. He died on April 28, 1908 at Brooklyn, New York and is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery."

He worked for the Babcock & Wilcox Boiler Company in Bayonne. He married Katherine Drudy. Cain became involved in politics in Bayonne in the early 1900s. In 1910, Cain, a Democrat, defeated incumbent Pierre P. Garven to become the 9th mayor of Bayonne. As mayor, Cain was very independent, and was many times at odds with the city's Democratic party. The following year, when he ran for re-election, he lost in the Democratic primary to Bayonne's Democratic leader Matthew T. Cronin. Cain lost again in 1914, ending his political career. Cain died on January 17, 1937 in his home after a long illness at age 75. His funeral was at St. Henry's Church in Bayonne. He is buried in Holy Name Cemetery in Jersey City."

He was known as Johnny De Pow by his constituents. Along with Bathhouse John Coughlin and Hinky Dink Kenna, Powers was considered one of the leaders of the \"Gray Wolves\" of Chicago politics. Powers arrived in Chicago in 1872 and began working as an apprentice to a grocer. After opening his own grocery store, he added a tavern next to it and used his exposure there to begin a political career as a ward captain. In 1888, Powers ran for alderman of Chicago's 19th ward and won, after which he closed his grocery, but continued to run his saloon, eventually going into business with fellow an alderman, William O'Brian, to open a larger saloon which included gambling. Powers introduced the practice of distributing free turkeys, ducks, and geese to voters at Christmas, but his inability to keep his ward clean of garbage or maintain the schools led Jane Addams to target him. Addams also focused on Powers' corruption, citing instances of cronyism and bribery. Powers, in turn, used Addams's attacks on him to brand her as anti-Catholic, but he also hired her to be the ward's garbage inspector, the only paying job she ever held. In 1903, Powers ran against incumbent Peter F. Galligan for the state senate. During the campaign, Galligan showed up at Powers's home and attacked him with a brickbat. Powers won the election, but the following year he returned to Chicago and was reelected to serve as the 19th ward alderman, a position he retained until 1927. By the 1910s, the ethnic makeup of his ward had begun to change. Instead of being 90 percent Irish, it was only about 50 percent Irish, with the remainder being made up of Italian and Jewish immigrants. On September 28, 1920, a bomb exploded at Powers' home at 1284 Macalister shortly after he arrived, this proved to be the opening salvo in the 1921 aldermanic election. In 1921, Anthony D'Andrea, who Powers had supported for ward committeeman in 1919, but pulled his support after the Supreme Court negated D'Andrea's initial victory, challenged Powers for his seat as alderman. The election was marked by violence, which continued after Powers won the election by 381 votes. Shortly after the election, D'Andrea was assassinated. This election was the culmination of the Aldermen's Wars. Powers died as his home at 6038 Sheridan Road, on May 19, 1930, suffering from pulmonary edema and anemia, although he had been suffering throat tumors since 1929."

  "text" : "John Shields Tipton (* 14. August 1786 bei Sevierville, Tennessee; † 5. April 1839 in Logansport, Indiana) war ein US-amerikanischer Armeeoffizier und Politiker (Demokratische Partei). Er vertrat den Bundesstaat Indiana im US-Senat. Der im heutigen Sevier County geborene Tipton verlor schon früh seinen Vater, der von Indianern getötet wurde. Sein Großonkel, der ebenfalls John Tipton hieß, gehörte zu den prominenten Persönlichkeiten des Gebietes, weshalb er zeitweise zum Ziel von Aktionen der Anhänger eines von Tennessee unabhängigen State of Franklin wurde. Als er 17 Jahre alt war, zog John Tipton ins Harrison County im Indiana-Territorium. Dort heiratete er 1806 Martha Shields; die Ehe wurde 1816 geschieden. Er wurde in seiner neuen Heimat als Farmer tätig und trat einer Miliz bei, die ihn und andere Siedler vor Indianerangriffen schützen sollte. Während der Schlacht bei Tippecanoe kommandierte er die Kompanie der Yellow Jackets; später standen die Indiana Rangers im Britisch-Amerikanischen Krieg unter seinem Befehl. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt bekleidete Tipton den Rang eines Majors. Nach dem Friedensschluss wurde er zum Brigadegeneral befördert. In der Folge schlug Tipton eine politische Laufbahn ein. Er war von 1819 bis 1823 Abgeordneter im Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana; während dieser Zeit gründete er die heutige Stadt Columbus, die ursprünglich den Namen Tiptonia trug. Er gehörte Kommissionen an, in denen über die neue Staatshauptstadt diskutiert wurde, und beteiligte sich an der Beilegung von Grenzstreitigkeiten zwischen Indiana und Illinois. 1823 wurde er United States Indian Agent und führte in dieser Funktion offizielle Verhandlungen mit den Stämmen der Potawatomi und der Miami. Als die Gespräche mit den Potawatomi nicht erfolgreich verliefen, leitete Tipton deren gewaltsame Umsiedlung ins heutige Kansas ein; die Aktion, die mehr als 40 Indianer das Leben kostete, wurde unter dem Namen Potawatomi Trail of Death bekannt. Tipton, der 1825 ein zweites Mal geheiratet hatte, wurde im Jahr 1831 von der Indiana General Assembly zum Nachfolger des verstorbenen US-Senators James Noble gewählt; zwischenzeitlich hatte Robert Hanna dessen Mandat kommissarisch wahrgenommen. Am 9. Dezember 1831 zog Tipton in den Senat ein, wo er nach einer Wiederwahl im folgenden Jahr bis zum 3. März 1839 verblieb. Während dieser Zeit war er unter anderem Vorsitzender des Committee on Roads and Canals sowie des Committee on Indian Affairs. Aus gesundheitlichen Gründen verzichtete er auf eine erneute Kandidatur; zwei Wochen nach seinem Ausscheiden aus dem Senat verstarb er in Logansport, einer von ihm mitbegründeten Stadt. Das Tipton County in Indiana und dessen Verwaltungssitz Tipton sind nach John Tipton benannt."

  "text" : "John Warfield Johnston (September 9, 1818 – February 27, 1889) was an American lawyer and politician from Abingdon, Virginia. He served in the Virginia State Senate, and represented Virginia in the United States Senate when the state was readmitted after the American Civil War. He was United States Senator for 13 years. In national politics, he was a Democrat. Johnston had been ineligible to serve in Congress because of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbade anyone who had sworn allegiance to the United States and subsequently sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War from holding public office. However, his restrictions were removed at the suggestion of the Freedmen's Bureau when he aided a sick and dying former slave after the War. He was the first person who had sided with the Confederacy to serve in the United States Senate. Several issues marked Johnston's senatorial career. He was caught in the middle during the debate over the Arlington Memorial. The initial proposal to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston, yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of Robert E. Lee; the need to stay quiet for the sake of the Democratic Party, however, proved decisive. Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill, a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South, which figured in the Compromise of 1877. He was also an outspoken Funder during Virginia's heated debate as to how much of its pre-War debt the state ought to have been obliged to pay back. The controversy culminated in the formation of the Readjuster Party and the appointment of William Mahone as its leader; this marked the end of Johnston's career in the Senate."

  "text" : "John W. Lavelle (January 26, 1949 – January 24, 2007) formerly represented the 61st Assembly District in the New York State Assembly, which comprises much of the North Shore of Staten Island. Lavelle, a former executive with Met Life, was a champion for the poor and less fortunate. He served as a member of the New York State Charter Commission for Staten Island in 1993, and became Staten Island Democratic Party Chairman in 1999. He was first elected to the New York State Assembly in 2000, filling the seat formerly occupied by Assemblywoman Betty Connelly. He served on a number of committees, including Government Employees, Social Services, Veterans Affairs and Mental Health, among others. Assemblyman Lavelle was known for sponsoring bills calling for the same benefits of those who died in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing as those who died in the 2001 attack and for being an advocate for stronger gun control laws. In addition, Lavelle spent over 20 years working for quality health care by serving on the Community Advisory Board for the Sisters of Charity Health Care System at St. Vincent's Medical Center. He started a monthly recreation program for patients at Sea View Hospital Rehabilitation Center and Home and served as Chairman of the Center's Advisory Board. He has also helped substance abusers get their lives back on track by serving as vice chair of the Camelot Counseling Center's Board of Directors. Lavelle suffered a stroke on January 19, 2007 and died in a coma on January 24, just two days short of his 58th birthday. Lavelle is survived by his three sons and four grandchildren. To honor his death and to allow members of the New York State Assembly to attend his funeral, Speaker of the New York State Assembly Sheldon Silver canceled the session of the Assembly for January 28, 2007. The funeral service was attended by over 1,000 people and included the Governor of the State of New York Eliot Spitzer, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, candidates for New York State Comptroller, over 50 Assemblymembers, and all of the elected officials from Staten Island from both political parties. His seat was filled by special election, with fellow Democrat Matthew Titone elected to succeed him in the Assembly."

  "text" : "Jonas Marion Hoyl (March 3, 1834 – October 25, 1906) was the eleventh President of the Chico Board of Trustees, the governing body of Chico, California from 1891 to 1892. He also served on the Butte County Board of Supervisors from 1876 to 1878. Jonas was born March 3, 1834, in McMinn County, Tennessee, the son of Peter V. Hoyl and Mary Carlock. He was educated in Greenfield, Missouri. He was engaged in the horse and cattle trade for two years in Missouri before coming to California. At age 23, he crossed the plains with a drove of cattle and arrived at Missouri Bend, on the Sacramento River, in 1857. He settled on land on Pine Creek, thirteen miles north of Chico, and engaged in farming and stock raising. In 1858, Hoyl married Elizabeth P. Daugherty, a native of Arkansas. The marriage lasted until her death in 1865. Jonas and Elizabeth had three daughters, Mary, Laura and Sadie. Laura died at the age of seven. After remaining on the farm several years, Hoyl moved to Chico, purchased lots and built a house on Wall Street between West Second and West Third Streets. In 1868, he married Sarah Jane Henshaw, a Virginia native, who was raised in Missouri. In 1875, he was elected a member of the Butte County Board of Supervisors, and served from 1876 to 1878. He was also elected as a trustee of the school board and in 1877, was chosen to fill an unexpired term of a member of the city council. He was elected to a complete term in 1888 and served until 1892 becoming president of the council his last year in office. In 1897, he married Annie M. Whitesides. He is buried in the Chico Cemetery."

In 2006, he unsuccessfully challenged incumbent U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary, principally because of the incumbent's vote for the Iraq War. He is currently president of the Economic Future Group, a national consulting group in the United States. He also writes frequently for a labor and economy blog Working Life."

His positions created a rift between him and the Indiana General Assembly who overrode all of his anti-banking vetoes. He responded by launching legal challenges to the acts, but was ruled against by the Indiana Supreme Court. The state's second constitutional convention was held during 1850-1851 in which the current Constitution of Indiana was drafted. He was a supporter of the new constitution and gave speeches around the state urging its adoption. He was opposed throughout his term by Senator Jesse D. Bright, the leader of the state Democratic Party. After his term as governor, he was appointed to serve as United States Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Prussia where he served until the outbreak of the American Civil War. Although he was a Democrat, he was openly pro-Union during the war, and was elected to serve as a United States Senator, filling the term of Copperhead Jesse D. Bright, who was expelled from the Senate for disloyalty. Following the war he was reappointed to his ambassadorial post where he remained until his death in Berlin, Prussia."

  "text" : "Joseph \"Joe\" Berrios (born February 14, 1952) is a Democratic politician who is the Assessor of Cook County, Illinois, and an Illinois state government lobbyist. One of seven children of Puerto Rican native parents, and raised in the Cabrini-Green public housing project, he became the first Hispanic American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly and the first and only Hispanic American to chair the Cook County Democratic Party. He was a Commissioner on the Cook County Board of Review, a property tax assessment appeal panel. Throughout his career, Berrios combined government sector jobs, elected office, unpaid political party leadership positions, and private sector proprietorships in lobbying, consulting and insurance sales. His political campaign strategies included ballot access challenges to potential opponents. He has been the focus of investigations into allegations of ethics violations and political corruption with respect to campaign fund-raising and nepotism. In the press and in the courts, Berrios has repeatedly defended his right as an elected official to hire relatives and to accept campaign contributions from those with business before his office."

He was a state legislator representing Evansville, Indiana, and then served in the Mexican–American War, becoming a general. President James K. Polk appointed Lane as the first Governor of Oregon Territory. When Oregon was admitted as a state in 1859, Lane was elected one of Oregon's first two U.S. Senators. In 1860, Lane was nominated for Vice President of the pro-slavery Southern wing of the Democratic Party, as John C. Breckinridge's running mate. Lane's pro-slavery views and sympathy for the Confederate States of America in the Civil War effectively ended his political career in Oregon. A son was later elected U.S. Representative and a grandson U.S. Senator, making Lane the patriarch of one of the state's most prominent political families."

  "text" : "Kate Hogan (born January 15, 1957 in Lynn, Massachusetts) is an American politician from Stow, Massachusetts. A Democrat, she is a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives representing the 3rd Middlesex district. She was first elected in 2008 and took office on January 7, 2009. The 3rd Middlesex district, which includes the towns of Bolton, Hudson, Maynard and Stow, was represented for 24 years by Patricia Walrath, who decided not to seek re-election in 2008. Five candidates ran for to succeed her: three Democrats, one Republican and one Independent. Prior to the primary, Walrath endorsed Hogan as her chosen successor. In the three-way primary election held on September 16, 2008, Hogan won 50 percent of the vote to the second-placed finisher's 40 percent. She went on to face two opponents in the general election on November 4, narrowly besting the Republican nominee, Hudson selectman Sonny Parente, by 10,156 votes to 9,281. She ran for re-election in 2010, facing no Republican opponent and taking 60% of the vote against an Independent. Her first action on being sworn-in on January 7, 2009 was to turn down a pay raise. She donated the $3,000 increase in legislative salaries to the local libraries in Bolton, Hudson, Maynard and Stow. On February 26, 2015 Speaker Robert DeLeo appointed Hogan as Chair of the Joint Committee on Public Health. Hogan, a native of Lynn, Massachusetts, is a graduate of the University of Massachusetts Amherst and works as vice president of Gnomon Inc., a Boston printing company. She has long been involved in local Democratic politics, having served as an officer of the Stow Democratic Town Committee, the Middlesex and Worcester Democrats and as co-chairman of the Maynard Democratic Town Committee from 1999 to 2006. She has also sat on several of Stow's town committees, including the Community Preservation Committee and the Council on Aging. Hogan, a lesbian, is married to Susan Vick. She is one of five openly LGBT members of the Massachusetts General Court, alongside Representatives Sarah Peake (D–Provincetown), Liz Malia (D–Jamaica Plain) and Denise Andrews (D–Orange), as well as Senator Stan Rosenberg (D–Amherst). Her 2008 and 2010 campaigns won the support of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund."

In den späten 1960er-Jahren begann Kay Barnes sich auf kommunaler Ebene zu engagieren. Sie arbeitete zunächst als Freiwillige und später als Angestellte für ein städtisches Kooperationsprojekt. Außerdem vertrat sie die Interessen weiblicher Studenten an der University of Missouri in Kansas City. 1974 wurde sie in die Legislative des Jackson County gewählt; ab 1979 gehörte sie dem Stadtrat von Kansas City an. Privat betrieb sie ihr eigenes Unternehmen auf dem Bereich der Personalewintwicklung, Kay Waldo, Inc., dem sie 23 Jahre lang als Präsidentin vorstand. Barnes wurde an ihrem Geburtstag 1999 als Nachfolgerin von Emanuel Cleaver zur Bürgermeisterin gewählt, wobei sie sich mit 59:41 Prozent der Stimmen gegen George Blackwood durchsetzte, und im Jahr 2003 für eine zweite Amtszeit bestätigt. Sie ist Demokratin und war die erste weibliche Bürgermeisterin vom Kansas City. Die größte Leistung ihrer Amtszeit war die Wiederbelebebung von Downtown Kansas City, das zu Beginn ihrer Amtszeit ziemlich heruntergekommen war. Außerdem regte sie den Bau des Sprint Center an, das im Oktober 2007 fertiggestellt wurde. Ihr Nachfolger wurde im Mai 2007 Mark Funkhouser. Im Jahr 2008 bewarb Kay Barnes sich um einen Sitz im Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten. Sie wurde von ihrer Partei zwar nominiert, unterlag bei den Wahlen dann aber dem republikanischen Amtsinhaber Sam Graves deutlich mit 37:59 Prozent der Stimmen."

He attended public schools and in 1985 graduated from New Mexico State University with degrees in finance and real estate. In 1984 Miyagishima began his insurance and financial services business while still in college. In 1992 he became New Mexico’s first American of Japanese descent to be elected to public office. From 1998 through 2000 he was voted “Best County Commissioner” in a local newspaper readers’ poll. Miyagishima’s accomplishments were included in Distinguished Asian-American Political and Governmental Leaders, printed by Greenwood Press. In 2002, he received the Commander’s Award for Public Service from the Department of the Army. Miyagishima won re-election as City Councilman in 2005 running unopposed. Miyagishima is the first American of Japanese and Mexican descent to be elected Mayor of Las Cruces. He is also the second person in Doña Ana County to have been elected both Chairman of the Doña Ana County Commission and Mayor of Las Cruces. Miyagishima is a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a national, bipartisan coalition of American mayors who advocate for Universal Background Checks, gun & ammo registration/restriction while creating exceptions for law enforcement and personal bodyguards. In August 2013, Miyagishima applied to become Doña Ana County Manager, but the following month he was told that he had not been successful, as other candidates were better qualified."

  "text" : "Laurence Curran Hodgson (November 6, 1874 – March 24, 1937) was an American newspaper journalist, poet, and politician from Saint Paul, Minnesota. Hodgson was a newspaper reporter and columnist, writing at different times for the Minneapolis Times and the St. Paul Dispatch-Pioneer Press. He had a column that appeared daily on the back page of the Dispatch called \"Cabbages and Kings,\" a reference to Lewis Carroll's poem, \"The Walrus and the Carpenter.\" He commonly wrote under the pen name \"Larry Ho.\" The name came about when he had written his first feature article for the Times. He was signing his name, \"Larry Hodgson,\" but his pencil broke after the first \"o.\" The city editor, James Gray, reportedly said, \"Better let it go at that–'Larry Ho.'\" He served as secretary to both St. Paul mayors Winn Powers and Vivian R. Irvin, and upon the expiration of Irvin's term, he was elected mayor by a large majority. He served two non-consecutive terms as mayor from 1918 to 1922, and from 1926 to 1930. Hodgson also ran for governor in 1920, but came third in the race, garnering only 81,293 votes. After Hodgson's death in 1937, his son, Laurence K. Hodgson, edited and published a book called \"Howdy Folks: Selections from the Writings, Verse and Speeches of Larry Ho.\""

  "text" : "Levi Stewart Udall (January 20, 1891 – May 30, 1960) was a U.S. lawyer who served as Chief Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court. He was a member of the Udall political family. Born and raised in Arizona, he was the son of David King Udall, a politician, and Eliza Stewart Udall, the first telegraph operator in the Arizona Territory. He was named after his grandfather, Levi Stewart. He was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 1914 he married Louisa Lee, a granddaughter of John D. Lee and Jacob Hamblin. They would later have six children. He passed the Arizona Bar exam in 1922, and was admitted to the bar, without having earned a law degree (a common practice in those days). Later that year he succeeded his father as stake president of the St. Johns Stake, a position he held until 1945. In 1922, he lost a bid to be elected as clerk to the Arizona Superior Court. He was defeated by his older brother John Hunt Udall. In 1946 he was elected to the Arizona Supreme Court, and remained a Justice of that court from 1947 until his death. In 1948 Udall wrote the majority opinion of the Arizona State Supreme Court granting Native Americans living on reservations the right to vote. From 1951-1952 and 1957-1958 he served as the Chief Justice of that court. In 1960 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Arizona. He died on May 30 of that year."

After an unsuccessful early entry into politics as a Republican running under her married name Loretta Brixey for city council in the wealthy Los Angeles suburb of Palos Verdes Estates, she changed her party affiliation and rebranded herself under her maiden name to first be elected in 1996, when she defeated long-serving GOP congressman Bob Dornan by fewer than 1,000 votes. Sánchez represented the 46th district from 1997 to 2003, then California's 47th congressional district from 2003 to 2013, and again in the 46th district from 2013 to the present. The district lies in central Orange County. Since 1996, Sánchez has been a member of the Democratic Party, and of the House Blue Dog Coalition. Instead of running for re-election to the House in November 2016, Sánchez is running in the U.S. Senate race in California and is one of two candidates to reach the general election for that seat. If she wins she will be the first Latina ever to serve in the United States Senate."

  "text" : "Marguerite Alice \"Missy\" LeHand (September 13, 1898 – July 31, 1944) was private secretary to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) for 21 years. According to Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, during FDR's presidency, LeHand became \"the most celebrated private secretary in the country\". Born into a poor Irish-American family in New York, LeHand attended secretarial school, took a series of clerical jobs, and eventually began to work for the Democratic Party's New York office. There she came to the attention of FDR's wife Eleanor during his 1920 vice presidential candidacy and was hired as FDR's personal secretary. After FDR was partially paralyzed by polio, LeHand became his daily companion, to the extent of adopting his favorite hobbies, games, and drinks. She remained his secretary when he became Governor of New York in 1929 and when he became president in 1933, serving until a 1941 stroke left her unable to speak. She moved to her sister's home in Boston and died in 1944. The exact nature of LeHand's relationship with FDR is debated by historians. It is generally accepted that their relationship contained a romantic element, though scholars remain divided on whether the pair had a sexual relationship. LeHand was engaged to U.S. Ambassador William Bullitt in 1933, but never married, later asking a friend, \"How could anyone ever come up to FDR?\""

  "text" : "Marilyn Roman (born March 1936) is an American educator and Democratic Party politician who served as Acting Mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey. As City Council President, she became Acting Mayor succeeding Gerald McCann after his removal from office. Roman was the first woman to hold the office of mayor in the history of Jersey City. Roman attended New Jersey City University earning a bachelor's degree in elementary education and a master's degree in urban education. She worked as a teacher and supervisor for the Jersey City Board of Education. Roman became involved in politics as a member of the Everett Terrace Block Association where she served as a representative attending City Council Meetings. At the urging of McCann, she was elected to the Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders in 1984 and served two terms. Running on McCann's ticket, Roman was elected to the city council in 1989. Roman was director of the Education-Business Alliance of the Jersey City Board of Education and president of the City Council when McCann was removed from office following his conviction on Federal fraud charges. Roman continued to fill the vacancy when the city council failed to elect another candidate after 30 days. Roman served as mayor for four months until the city council reorganized and selected a new Council President. Following the announced retirement of Congressman Frank J. Guarini, Roman organized and supported a slate of candidates in the 1992 Democratic Primary. She claimed to organize the ticket to support candidates for the Democratic County Committee farther down the ballot. Roman's candidates were opposed by a slate headed by State Senator Robert Menendez and supported by Hudson County Executive Robert C. Janiszewski. Menendez defeated Robert P. Haney by a ratio of 2-1, and Roman's candidates for Democratic County Committee only won one-third of the seats. The City Council of Jersey City reorganized on July 1, 1992 and selected Joseph Rakowski as the new president. Rakowski also became acting mayor and the third mayor in that year. Roman retained her seat on the city council and completed her term. She ran to fill the remainder of the unexpired term in the special election, but came in third out of a field of nineteen candidates."

  "text" : "Mark C. Poloncarz (born November 7, 1967) is the county executive of Erie County, New York. Poloncarz, a Democrat, was elected county executive on November 8, 2011 after defeating the incumbent county executive Chris Collins a Republican by a 53 - 47 percentage point margin. Poloncarz was re-elected on November 3, 2015 with 66% of the vote when he easily defeated the Republican candidate Raymond Walter (33% of the vote) and Green Party candidate Eric Jones (1% of the vote). Poloncarz is only the 2nd Democrat to be elected to the position of county executive in the 51-year history of the position. Entering 2015 Poloncarz was heavily favored to be re-elected county executive; however it was expected he would face a Republican challenge from one of three candidates: incumbent county clerk and former New York Secretary of State Christopher Jacobs, incumbent county comptroller Stefan Mychajliw, or legislator Ed Rath, the grandson of the first Erie County Executive Edward Rath. In the end, all three individuals decided not to run and Walter was chosen by the Republicans. Unlike 2015, when Poloncarz entered the race in May 2011 he was a heavy underdog. However, by focusing on issues of providing efficient, yet cost-effective government, reducing waste, fraud and abuse of the public's tax dollars, supporting the \"People's Mandates,\" and properly funding libraries and arts and cultural institutions, Poloncarz was able to chip away a sizable Collins lead until he won in surprisingly easy fashion. Poloncarz also capitalized on his \"son of a steelworker\" blue collar background against Collins self-proclaimed businessman style. Since taking office as Erie County Executive, Poloncarz worked to change the culture of Erie County government and return it to its core mission: provide the programs and services that residents and taxpayers demand as effectively and efficiently as possible. And as such, he made it a priority to restore funding for what he calls the “People’s Mandates,” which include the rodent control program, parks improvements, road and bridge construction, libraries, summer youth programming and a renewed commitment to arts and cultural organizations. These programs were restored by Poloncarz in a fiscally responsible manner without raising taxes. As evidence of the fiscal stewardship, in 2014, Standard & Poor’s upgraded the county’s credit rating three steps to “AA-” and in 2015 Fitch Ratings upgraded the county's credit rating to \"A+.\" In early 2015, Poloncarz released “Initiatives for a Stronger Community,” his health and human services plan for Erie County. The plan included 49 separate initiatives to address issues of poverty throughout the county, including issues facing the City of Buffalo, which was identified as the 3rd poorest city in America when Poloncarz took office in 2012. Poloncarz also shepherded a pay equity policy through the Erie County Industrial Development Agency requiring all applicants for tax incentives to agree to a policy to provide salary data to the agency to prove they do in fact pay women equally. In 2015, Poloncarz also worked with the county legislature to pass a budget for 2016 that reduced the county's property tax rate from $4.99 to $4.96 per thousand of assessed value, the second year in a row the county's tax rate was reduced. 2014 was a significant year for the Poloncarz administration, including working with the legislature to pass a balanced budget with a small tax cut, opening the Erie County Health Mall, signing an executive order requiring that all contractors with Erie County comply with equal pay laws for women, restructuring the Department of Social Services to address issues with the Division of Child Protective Services, and managing the emergency response to four major weather-related events: two blizzards, flooding in West Seneca and the worst storm to hit the region in nearly 40 years: Winter Storm Knife a/k/a Snowvember Storm. In 2013, Poloncarz announced his “Initiatives for a Smart Economy,” which represents his administration’s commitment to a comprehensive, innovative approach to economic development and provides the “missing link,” tying a host of diverse initiatives into one regional development effort. Specifically, this plan includes a total of 64 initiatives across a dozen areas, representing the economic gears that, working together, will help drive our economic future. More than half of these Initiatives are complete and showing results around Erie County. In fact, since Poloncarz took office as county executive in January, 2012, more than 16,000 new private sector jobs have been created in the Buffalo-Niagara Metropolitan Area, and the county's unemployment rate has dropped from 8.9% in January, 2012 to 4.7% as of December, 2015. Additionally, Poloncarz has stated the key to his administration’s success is to create strong partnerships with other levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors, educational institutions and community groups. Examples include the creation of one of New York State’s first Land Banks, the establishment of the Erie County Medicaid Anti-Fraud Unit, as well as the successful negotiation of a new 10-year lease with the Buffalo Bills that is fair for local and state taxpayers and kept the team in Buffalo following the death of the team's owner Ralph Wilson Jr. At the time Poloncarz ran for county executive in 2011 he was the elected county comptroller in Erie County. Poloncarz was first elected comptroller in 2005 and was re-elected in 2009 in a three-person race by defeating Republican Phil Kadet and Independence Party candidate Michael Abramo by a 52 - 45 - 3 percentage point margin, respectively. Prior to being elected comptroller Poloncarz was an American business and finance lawyer residing in Buffalo, New York. Poloncarz was first elected county comptroller on a platform of restoring fiscal stability and accountability to the county by acting as the taxpayers \"watchdog.\" He is the first comptroller to be elected after a state control board was created and imposed over the county to oversee county finances. While he was the endorsed candidate of the county Democratic party, he defeated 2 challengers in the primary and then a Republican in the general election. Poloncarz has a bachelor's degree from the University at Buffalo and a law degree from the University of Toledo. Poloncarz was the 2003 - 2004 Buffalo and western New York coordinator and spokesman for the John Kerry presidential campaign. He was an at large district delegate for John Kerry at the 2004 Democratic National Convention and to Hillary Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Poloncarz was the founder and first president of the WNY Coalition for Progress, a progressive think tank in upstate New York which today is known as the Western New York Democrats for Progress."

Anschließend betrieb er bis 1983 wieder eine eigene Kanzlei. 1982 wurde Andrews im neu eingerichteten 25. Distrikt von Texas in den Kongress, wo er sein Mandat nach mehrfacher Wiederwahl vom 3. Januar 1983 bis zum 3. Januar 1995 ausübte. 1994 kandidierte er nicht erneut, sondern bewarb sich um einen Sitz im US-Senat. In der Primary der Demokraten belegte er jedoch nur den dritten Platz."

He was educated at Shelton State Community College and earned his bachelor's degree from New England School of Theology in 1949. He served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1965 to 1968, representing Roxbury, Massachusetts. He has also been a member of the Boston Mayor's Committee on Violence and the Attorney General's Advisory Committee on Drug Addiction. He was pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury from 1964 to 2004. During the 1960s and 1970s Haynes played an active role in the civil rights movement. In 1965, he helped plan Martin Luther King Jr.'s entrance into Boston when he came to speak on Boston Common that spring. The major focus of King's speech on April 23 was school desegregation in Boston. The Haynes Early Education school located in Roxbury was aptly named in his honor. On 9 November 2006, Northeastern University President Joseph E. Aoun met with members of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Massachusetts at the People's Baptist Church (830 Tremont Street, Boston) to discuss possible collaborations between Northeastern and Lower Roxbury clergy. During the meeting, Reverend Michael E. Haynes suggested the University create a history of the African American community in Lower Roxbury. As a result, President Aoun appointed Joseph D. Warren, at that time Special Assistant to the Director of Government Relations and Community Affairs, to oversee the Lower Roxbury Black History Project. Warren appointed an advisory board consisting of Rev. Michael E. Haynes, formerly of Roxbury's Twelfth Baptist Church, Massachusetts State Representative Byron Rushing, Northeastern University Archivist Joan D. Krizack, and Northeastern University history professors."

  "text" : "Michael \"Mickey\" McGlothlin is an Appalachian public figure from Southwest Virginia. He began his career in public service when he was elected to Commonwealth's Attorney of Buchanan County, Virginia in 1979. Not seeking a second term, he co-founded the McGlothlin & Wife Law Firm in his hometown of Grundy. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he participated in numerous political, civic, and educational boards around Southwest Virginia and the state of Virginia. He heavily advocated for the establishment of the Appalachian School of Law and the Appalachian College of Pharmacy. Since its creation, he has served on the Board of Visitors for both schools and also serves as President of the Appalachian College of Pharmacy. McGlothlin served as the lead prosecutor in the 1981-82 trial of Roger Keith Coleman, which resulted in the conviction and execution of Coleman for first-degree murder. On June 12, 2007, McGlothlin lost a bid for the Democratic Party nomination for the 3rd District Seat of the Virginia House of Delegates."

  "text" : "Myrth York (born June 7, 1946) is a Democratic politician, former Rhode Island State Senator and three-time unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Rhode Island. York was born in Maplewood, New Jersey. She is the daughter of chemical engineer, entrepreneur and philanthropist Otto H. York. She earned her Bachelor of Arts from the University of Denver in 1968 and a law degree from Boston University in 1972. York earned an LL.M. from BU in taxation in 1979. York served in the Rhode Island State Senate from 1991 to 1994, and on the Senate Corporations Committee and the Senate Health, Education and Welfare Committee. During her second term she was chairman of the HEW Committee. In the Senate she was known for being strongly liberal on social issues and defending the rights of women and minorities. York served as a fellow for the Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government during the spring of 1999. York ran unsuccessfully for governor three times. She \"ran a competitive bid in 1994 — a tough year for Democrats nationally — losing to Republican Lincoln C. Almond by 3 percentage points. But she slipped further behind in the two subsequent elections, losing to Almond by 9 points in 1998 and to Carcieri by 10 points in 2002.\" The 2002 campaign was particularly costly to York as she spent $3.8 million of her own money to finance what was to be her last bid for elected office.  A key turning point in the campaign was when York criticized Carcieri for the actions of businesses he had been associated with but refused to answer Carcieri's request that she reveal what companies her personal assets were invested in. In 2006 she endorsed Republican Senator Lincoln Chafee in his unsuccessful bid for re-election. (Chafee's Democratic opponent, Sheldon Whitehouse, had run against York in the 2002 Democratic gubernatorial primary). In the endorsement, York said that Chafee would be the first Republican she voted for since Richard Nixon. York was appointed to the Providence Zoning Board of Review and was re-appointed by incoming Mayor Angel Taveras in 2011. She currently serves as the Board's chair. York has received many awards, including the United Way's Legislator of the Year Award and the Claiborne Pell Award for outstanding service to the arts and people with disabilities."

  "text" : "Edward Miner „Ned“ Lamont, Jr. (* 3. Januar 1954 in Washington, D.C.) ist ein US-amerikanischer Politiker der Demokratischen Partei aus dem Bundesstaat Connecticut. Er war der Kandidat für einen Senatssitz von Connecticut bei den Senatswahlen vom 7. November 2006. In den parteiinternen Vorwahlen, die die Kandidatur festlegen, besiegte er den Amtsinhaber Joe Lieberman. Lamont ist Erbe eines Millionenvermögens und Angehöriger exklusiver Country Clubs, was zu Heucheleivorwürfen im Wahlkampf führte. Jedoch verfehlte er den Einzug in den Senat. Er unterlag Lieberman, der als unabhängiger Kandidat 50 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen errang und damit den Wiedereinzug in den Senat schaffte. Lamont kam nur auf 40 Prozent der Stimmen. Viele Anhänger der Republikanischen Partei gaben Lieberman ihre Stimme und versagten dem republikanischen Kandidaten Alan Schlesinger die Gefolgschaft. Lieberman wurden allgemein größere Chancen als Schlesinger eingeräumt, Lamont zu schlagen. Außerdem gilt Lieberman als wertkonservativ und war so für viele Anhänger der Republikaner wählbar. Im November 2009 kündigte Lamont an, dass er eventuell für die Gouverneurswahlen 2010 in Connecticut kandidieren wolle; im Februar 2010 reichte er seine Kandidatur offiziell bei der Demokratischen Partei ein. Auf einem Parteitag im Mai 2010 unterlag er seinem internen Herausforderer Dan Malloy deutlich. Da Lamont aber die interne Hürde von 15 Prozent der Parteitagsstimmen klar schaffte, konnte er an den Vorwahlen der Demokraten vom 10. August 2010 dennoch teilnehmen, wo er aber ebenfalls klar gegen seinen Konkurrenten Malloy verlor."

He was in large part responsible for consolidating elements of the Cook County Democratic Party into a political machine. He evolved from a local sewage contractor to a political boss by carefully selecting his political allies. His prominence stems from the death of Anton Cermak and his political career is intertwined with that of Edward Joseph Kelly. The success of this machine was attributed to its decision to be more inclusive than its predecessors. This meant that Nash had success at dealing with a variety of politicians such as William L. Dawson."

  "text" : "Paul T. Jordan (born c. 1941) is an American physician and Democratic Party politician who served as the 37th Mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey. He succeeded interim mayor Charles K. Krieger. Being 30 years old at the time of his election, Jordan is the youngest mayor in the history of Jersey City. After graduating from medical school in 1968, Jordan ran a drug rehabilitation center in Jersey City. His political involvement began when he joined a local reform group called the Community Action Council. Jordan was first elected as a reform candidate in a special election following the resignation of Thomas J. Whelan after Whelan's conviction for extortion and conspiracy. Jordan's election was hailed as an end to machine control of Jersey City politics, and was credited to support from a large number of young voters. He was re-elected to a full four-year term in 1973. Jordan was the first mayor to propose a major redevelopment of the Jersey City waterfront. During his term, Jordan appointed Shirley Tolentino as the first African-American woman to serve as a full-time municipal court judge in New Jersey. In 1977, Jordan simultaneously ran for reelection in Jersey City's non-partisan May election and for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New Jersey, with the primary held in June. Jordan used an aggressive television advertising campaign that was estimated to cost up to $200,000. After losing the mayoral election, he withdrew from the gubernatorial primary and supported incumbent Governor Brendan Byrne. Jordan's campaign later received a $30,000 campaign contribution from Byrne's campaign, allowing him to retire 25% of his campaign debt. Jordan retired from politics and returned to his medical career following his withdrawal from the primary. He later served as the Chairman of Emergency Medicine at Trinitas Hospital in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Jordan currently serves as a member of the New Jersey State Board of Human Services and served as its chairman from 1991 until 1996. He is also the treasurer of the State Board of Medical Examiners."

He is currently a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, working on issues of international economic development, Africa and public-private partnerships, and chairman of the US-Taiwan Business Council. He is considered to be a leading neoconservative. However, Wolfowitz rejects the term and prefers to call himself a \"Scoop Jackson Republican,\" after Democratic U.S. senator Henry M. Jackson who was known for his hawkish views on foreign policy. After serving two years, he resigned as president of the World Bank Group due to scandals described by a Reuters report as \"a protracted battle over his stewardship, prompted by his involvement in a high-paying promotion for his companion\". He was reportedly the model for a minor character named Philip Gorman in Saul Bellow's 2001 book Ravelstein."

From 1977 to 1979, Sorenson served as a Special Assistant to the Secretary of Agriculture during the Carter Administration. While in private law practice from 1982 to 1995, Sorenson also served as a member of the Board of Education at Lane Community College in Eugene Oregon. During his tenure at Lane Community College, Sorenson advocated strongly for dislocated workers' retraining programs and for childcare for staff and students. In 1993, Sorenson was appointed to the Oregon State Senate, and was elected to a full Senate term in 1994. He was elected Assistant Minority Leader during the 1995 session. Because Oregon term limits at that time prevented Sorenson from running for reelection as a State Senator, he ran for County Commissioner in 1996 and was elected to his first term. He ran successfully for reelection as a County Commissioner in 2000, 2004 and 2008; in 2008 he ran unopposed. In 2009 he was elected by the four other commissioners as Chair of the Board of Commissioners, a position he has held before. Sorenson has always run on a \"pro-environment, pro-education, pro-senior, pro-regular taxpayer, pro-child, pro-civil rights, pro-civil liberties, and pro-people\" platform. In January 2005, Sorenson announced he would challenge incumbent Governor Ted Kulongoski, also a Democrat. Sorenson was defeated in the May 2006 Democratic primary for Governor, receiving 16.27% of the vote. In July 2007 Pete Sorenson and Kim Leval were married. Kim is the Executive Director for the Northwest Center for Alternatives to Pesticides.

Suozzi defeated Republican candidate attorney Drew Fonrose and incumbent two-term Democratic Mayor Mary Ann Holzkamp. His mantra was and is, \"It's about people, not politics.\" Suozzi is known for being a hands-on mayor who often responds to citizens personally and can be found responding to the scenes of city emergencies on a regular basis. During Superstorm Sandy in 2012, he kept City Hall open 24/7 for the first five days after the storm."

  "text" : "Richard Joseph Daley (May 15, 1902 – December 20, 1976) was an American politician who served as the Mayor of Chicago for a total of 21 years (1955–1976) and chairman of the Cook County Democratic Central Committee for 23 years, holding both positions until his death in office in 1976. Daley was Chicago's third consecutive mayor from the working-class, heavily Irish American Bridgeport neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, where he lived his entire life. Daley is remembered for doing much to avoid the declines that some other \"rust belt\" cities like Cleveland, Buffalo and Detroit experienced during the same period. He had a strong base of support in Chicago's Irish Catholic community, and he was treated by national politicians such as Lyndon B. Johnson as a pre-eminent Irish American, with special connections to the Kennedy family. Daley played a major role in the history of the Democratic Party, especially with his support of John F. Kennedy in 1960 and of Hubert Humphrey in 1968. Daley is the father of Richard M. Daley, also a former mayor of Chicago, William M. Daley, a former United States Secretary of Commerce, and John P. Daley, a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. While many members of Daley's administration were charged with corruption and convicted, Daley was never charged with corruption."

He was the national chairman of the Reform Party, and a frequent candidate on their ticket. He has since become a member of the Democratic Party. He is probably best known for his frequently running for mayor of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He has sought the office in 2005 and 2009. O'Hara first ran for Governor of Mississippi in 1991 as the Reform Party candidate. He received 11,253 votes, or 1.58%. He ran as the Reform Party candidate for the United States Senate in Mississippi in 2000. He received 7,315 votes, or 0.74% of the vote. In 2002 he ran for the U.S. Senate again and was the lone challenger to Thad Cochran. He received 97,226 votes, or 15.42%. While a member of the Reform Party, O'Hara supported the candidacy of George W. Bush. After his party nominated Ralph Nader as presidential candidate in 2004, O'Hara said he hoped Nader could spoil the election: \"I’m doing everything I can to make sure John Kerry never gets around the White House.\"This sentiment, and the fact that O'Hara was a supporter of the Ku Klux Klan's Samuel Bowers, and his statements that he had once favored the execution of abortion doctors, put O'Hara odds with other Reform Party members. In 2003 he was the Reform Party candidate for Governor of Mississippi and received 4,070 votes for 0.46% of the vote. In 2007 O'Hara ran as a Democrat for state treasurer and received 284,789 votes (39.47%). O'Hara sought the Democratic Party nomination for the United States Senate in 2008, however, he was defeated in the primary by Erik R. Fleming 65.8% - 34.2%. O'Hara ran for the seat in Mississippi's 3rd congressional district as a Democrat. Much to the chagrin of Reform Party members, O'Hara returned to their party in 2011. He announced he would run for governor on their ticket, and also filed to run for state treasurer as both a Democrat and a Reform Party candidate. He received 26,290 votes, or 3.01%, in the race for state treasurer. In Mississippi's 2012 election for U.S. Senate, O'Hara ran as the Reform Party candidate and received 13,194 votes, or 1.06%. He ran for Governor of Mississippi in the 2015 election, finishing last with less than 2% of the vote."

  "text" : "Stanley M. \"Stan\" Makowski (April 22, 1923 – August 5, 1981) was Mayor of the City of Buffalo, New York, serving 1974–1977. He was born in Buffalo on April 22, 1923, as the younger of two children of Polish immigrants. He dropped out of Hutchinson Central High School and served six months with the Civilian Conservation Corps. In 1943, he joined the Army and served three years during World War II, including an eight-month tour on Iwo Jima. After the war, he earned his high school diploma and attended Cornell University, where he received a certificate from the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations, and night school at Millard Fillmore College at the University of Buffalo. He married Florence Ziolo on August 7, 1954. In 1959, he accepted appointment to the at-large seat on the Common Council, when Thaddeus J. Dulski was elected to Congress. In 1969, Makowski ran as the Democratic candidate for Erie County executive; he was defeated in the general election by B. John Tutuska. In 1972, the Common Council created the post of deputy mayor and Makowski was the first appointed, serving under Mayor Frank A. Sedita. Upon Mayor Sedita's resignation of March 5, 1973, Makowski became mayor. He was elected as mayor on November 6, 1973 During his term, the Buffalo Convention Center was constructed, as was the Marine Midland Center. On January 28, 1977, a most disastrous blizzard struck Buffalo and Western New York. He served just one term as mayor. He died on August 5, 1981 and was buried in St. Stanislaus Cemetery in Cheektowaga, New York."

  "text" : "Steven Pankow (1908–1993) was Mayor of the City of Buffalo, New York, serving 1954–1957. He was born in Buffalo on March 29, 1908. He grew up in Freyfield-Wolnepole, Poland, until around 1922, when he returned to Buffalo to live with an aunt. He married Mary Conwall (1912-2002, born Konowalczuk) in 1930. He worked at the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna, New York and in the 1930s, opened his own automobile agency; a Dodge-Plymouth franchise, known as Pankow Motors. He served as clerk of Erie County, New York from 1949 to 1951. He was elected mayor on November 3, 1953, as the Democratic candidate. During his term, the Buffalo Skyway was extended, to erect a wider bridge over the Union Ship Canal, and the Kensington Expressway, the Niagara Thruway extension and the Scajaquada Creek Expressway were constructed. After his term he returned to automobile sales and worked at a number of patronage jobs with the city. After a brief illness, he died on July 25, 1993. He is buried in Mount Calvary Cemetery, Cheektowaga, New York."

Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Wizowaty grew up in Europe, Texas and Connecticut, graduating from Princeton University (BA cum laude, 1977) and Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont (MA, 1985).

She was re-elected to the House on November 2, 2010. Following redistricting, she was elected to represent the Chittenden 6-5 district in 2012.

He joined the Populist cause in the early 1890s and became the second Populist Party state governor in history. He was noted for his political radicalism, his opposition to the conservative Bourbon Democracy of President Grover Cleveland, his support for labor unions, and his opposition to the Chinese in Oregon. He was also noted for his prickly attitude toward both U.S. Presidents whose terms overlapped his own -- Benjamin Harrison and Cleveland, whom he once famously told via telegram to mind his own business. He later served as mayor of Portland from 1896 to 1898."

He opened a grocery store and later, with his two of his brothers James and Terrence, started the Consumers' Coal and Ice Company in 1873. Brady helped establish a ferry from Bergen Point, at the southern tip of Bayonne, to Staten Island called the Bergen Point Port Richmond ferry. He then established a stage coach line from Greenville (modern day Jersey City) to the ferry at Bergen Point. Brady, who was a Democrat, was appointed in 1885 by President Grover Cleveland to be the Postmaster of Bayonne. In 1903, Brady was elected mayor of Bayonne defeating Republican Pierre P. Garven and served for two years. In 1906, he returned to the company he helped found and worked there until his death at age 78. After a two-year illness, Brady died on March 13, 1928 in his home. His funeral was at St. Andrew's R.C. Church in Bayonne. He is buried in Holy Name Cemetery in Jersey City. His wife Ellen had died two months earlier."

  "text" : "Thomas P. Gaffey is an American politician. Gaffey, a Democrat, had been a state senator from Connecticut since 1995, but left office due to criminal violations on January 5, 2011. Gaffey, a resident of Meriden, has represented the towns of Cheshire, Meriden, Middlefield and Middletown in the Connecticut Senate. Gaffey was born in Meriden and graduated from Southern Connecticut State University. He was appointed in the fall of 2005 to serve as Chief Deputy Majority Leader by Senate Majority Leader Martin Looney and Senate President Pro Tempore Donald E. Williams, Jr., and previously served in the position. Gaffey also serves as an executive with the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority. In 2002, he was linked to meetings with failed energy firm Enron. He was also cited that year for spending over $10,000 in personal expenses on his authority expense account, and failing to make timely reimbursement, but later issued a CRRA check for more than $1,600 to repay amounts reimbursed in excess. In January 2009 the Hartford Courant announced state auditors were looking into other instances of improper reimbursement by Gaffey, including double billing of out of state travel to both the state government and his political action committee. On January 18, the Courant urged the State Senate to censure Gaffey for his ethical improprieties. On May 6, 2009, the State Election Enforcement Commission announced that Gaffey and his campaign treasurer had agreed to a settlement over the double billing complaint. In one of the largest fines levied by the Commission, Gaffey agreed to a $6,000 fine and his treasurer agreed to a $3,000 fine. Gaffey also agreed to dissolve his political action committee and forfeit its $20,000 balance to the state. The commission's enforcement director called Gaffey's record keeping \"disastrous\". The charges later led to a criminal investigation and Gaffey's resignation. In 2006 Gaffey supported legislation spearheaded by fellow Democrat Donald Williams intended to address childhood obesity in Connecticut. The legislation was however derided by opponents as the \"cupcake bill.\" As of August 2008, more than 63% of eligibile school districts have enrolled in the program. In March 2008 New Haven schools enforced this policy by suspending an eighth grader for selling a classmate skittles. In May 2008, a principal in Greenwich was suspended in a dispute over bringing cupcakes to school. In 2007 Gaffey proposed that the Governor's power to appoint the Commissioner of Education be limited. Allies of Governor Jodi Rell labelled the proposal an attempted power grab. That year Gaffey also opposed efforts to increase education aid to suburban school districts, even those represented by fellow Democrats, in favor of adding more funds to urban districts. His response to complaints from suburban legislators was \"Like everything else in those districts, that is rich!\" Gaffey has also clashed with leaders of his local school board over the installation of artificial turf. In November 2007 Gaffey suggested that the state had to impose a more stringent school integration plan on suburbs in the Hartford region. \"The notion that we're going to get a better result by voluntary programs is ridiculous,\" said state Sen. Thomas Gaffey, D-Meriden, co-chairman of the legislature's education committee. \"We need to shift away from the model of remedy that the state has been pursuing for years. The district is as racially isolated today as it was 10 years ago. It suggests you need to do something different.\" Another Gaffey initiative was a bill that banned most out-of-school suspensions. Educators were unsure how they could comply with the law. In 2008 Gaffey did break with party leadership to support a Three Strikes Law to give life sentences to career violent criminals supported by Governor M. Jodi Rell. Thomas P. Gaffey was the father of three children. His son, Thomas M. Gaffey died on February 2, 2009, at the age of 16. In 2005 the Connecticut Appellate Court denied the Senator's ex-wife's request for increased child support."

Following his resignation, Jersey City was without a Mayor for 47 days while the city council failed to reach a consensus on a successor. Gangemi became a naturalized citizen on September 2, 1964. He filed petitions to run for Mayor again in 1965, but was refused by the City Clerk and New Jersey Superior Court before being allowed on the ballot (see Gangemi v. Rosengard 207 A.2d 665 (N.J. 1965))."

Under pressure to call the General Assembly into special session, he held it in the pro-Union town of Frederick, where he was able to keep the state from seceding. In December 1862, Hicks was appointed to the U.S. Senate, where he endorsed Lincoln's re-election in 1864, but died soon afterwards."

He grew up in Wyoming, Ontario, moving to Buffalo in 1906, and learned the printing business. He started his own printing business in 1911, the Holling Press. In 1924, the company opened a new 10-story plant at 501 Washington Street. On June 14, 1910, he married Mary Lenhard; she died in 1955 and he remarried the following year to Helen Busch Steele in St. Petersburg, Florida. He was elected mayor on November 2, 1937, as the Democratic candidate. During his term, the Lakeview and Willert Park housing projects were developed. Also constructed was the Kleinhans Music Hall and Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. After completing his single term, he returned to private life. In 1945, he received the Democratic nomination for mayor, but was defeated in the election by the Republican candidate Bernard J. Dowd. In early May 1946, Holling was one of several possible candidates in consideration for the post of governor of Puerto Rico. He died on November 25, 1966 in his home in Redington Beach, Florida, and was buried in Mount Calvary Cemetery in Cheektowaga, New York."

Leighton defeated former city leader Tom McGroarty in the Democratic Party primary election in 2003, partly on a platform to revitalize Wilkes-Barre's downtown sector. On June 9, 2005, Leighton unveiled his 'I believe...' campaign for Wilkes-Barre, which was intended to boost the city's spirits and rid residents of their cyncisim and negativity about the city. Construction is complete on a planned downtown 14-screen theatre complex and a two-floor Barnes & Noble bookstore. The movie theater opened in July 2006. A Barnes & Noble bookstore opened in early October 2006. New street lights have replaced worn out red lights in the Public Square and in parts of the downtown area."

He was the only African-American mayor of that city, and his 20 years in office mark the longest tenure by any mayor in the city's history. His 1973 election made him the second African-American mayor of a major U.S. city. Bradley retired in 1993, after his approval ratings began dropping subsequent to the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. Bradley unsuccessfully ran for Governor of California in 1982 and 1986 and was defeated each time by the Republican George Deukmejian. The racial dynamics that appeared to underlie his narrow and unexpected loss in 1982 gave rise to the political term \"the Bradley effect.\" In 1985, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP."

McGroarty was from East End and was born on December 22, 1962. In 1983, McGroarty was elected to Wilkes-Barre City Council and served for twelve years before his election as mayor. McGroarty graduated from Coughlin High School, Luzerne County Community College and Bloomsburg University. He was both an officer and enlisted member of the 109th Field Artillery, where he served as service battery commander. McGroarty was elected mayor in 1995 and re-elected in 1999. He was the only mayor to be elected both as a Democratic and Republican, having waged a successful write in campaign as a Republican in 1995. By securing the both nominations, McGroarty enjoyed relationships with both Democratic and Republicans officials. McGroarty expanded city services in each of the city's twelve neighborhoods. But his main focus became emergency preparedness and recovery, as a result of a blizzard and significant flooding in his first month in office. McGroarty met President William J. Clinton at the White House, and hosted the President during a tour of Wilkes-Barre on February 16, 1996. During his visit, President Clinton announced federal funding for the Wyoming Valley Levee Raising Project, which provided flood protection. Long after McGroarty's departure, those same levees, enhanced on his watch, protected Wilkes-Barre in September 2011, when river levels were 42.66 feet, 1.75 feet above the flood level of Hurricane Agnes."

  "text" : "Walter Holden Capps (May 5, 1934 – October 28, 1997) was an American politician. He was a Democratic Party member of the United States House of Representatives. Capps lost an election to Andrea Seastrand for the 22nd district in California in 1994, which was a landslide year for the Republicans. While driving home from a campaign event during the summer of 1996, Capps' vehicle was struck by a drunk driver. Capps was seriously injured and was unable to actively campaign until the final few weeks of the race. During his absence from the campaign, his opponent, graciously, didn't make his failing health an issue. Ultimately, despite his absence from the campaign trail, Capps won, even as Bob Dole edged Bill Clinton in the district. Capps died of a heart attack at Dulles Airport only nine months into his term. The Reverend Jesse Jackson attended his funeral. Capps was succeeded by his widow, Lois Capps, who won in a special election in the spring of 1998. Subsequent legislation by Congresswoman Capps has mandated the presence of AEDs in public places. Before entering politics, Capps taught for more than thirty years at the University of California, Santa Barbara. As a Professor in the Religious Studies department he helped define the field, and cataloged the growth and changes in his 1995 book Religious Studies: The Making of a Discipline. An anti-war activist during the 1960s, he later initiated a nationally renowned course titled \"Religion and the Impact of Vietnam\" in 1979. His name lives on in the Walter H. Capps Center for the Study of Ethics, Religion and Public Life at the University of California, Santa Barbara."

  "text" : "Wendell Lewis Willkie (born Lewis Wendell Willkie; February 18, 1892 – October 8, 1944) was an American lawyer and corporate executive, and the 1940 Republican nominee for President. Willkie appealed to many convention delegates as the Republican field's only interventionist: although the U.S. remained neutral prior to Pearl Harbor, he favored greater U.S. involvement in World War II to support Britain and other Allies. His Democratic opponent, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the 1940 election with about 55% of the popular vote and took the electoral college vote by a wide margin. Willkie was born in Indiana in 1892; both his parents were lawyers, and he also became one. He served in World War I but was not sent to France until the final days of the war, and saw no action. Willkie settled in Akron, Ohio, where he was initially employed by Firestone, but left for a law firm, becoming one of the leaders of the Akron bar. Much of his work was representing electric utilities, and in 1929 Willkie accepted a job in New York City as counsel for Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (C&S), a utility holding company. He was rapidly promoted, and became corporate president in 1933. Roosevelt was sworn in as U.S. president soon after Willkie became head of C&S, and announced plans for a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that would supply power in competition with C&S. Between 1933 and 1939, Willkie fought against the TVA before Congress, in the courts, and before the public. He was ultimately unsuccessful, but sold C&S's property for a good price, and gained public esteem. A longtime Democratic activist, Willkie changed his party registration to Republican in late 1939. He did not run in the 1940 presidential primaries, but positioned himself as an acceptable choice for a deadlocked convention. He sought backing from uncommitted delegates, while his supporters – many youthful – enthusiastically promoted his candidacy. As German forces under Hitler rampaged through western Europe in 1940, many Republicans did not wish to nominate an isolationist like Thomas E. Dewey, and turned to Willkie, who was nominated on the sixth ballot over Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft. Willkie's support for aid to Britain removed it as a major factor in his race against Roosevelt, and Willkie also backed the president on a peacetime draft. Both men took more isolationist positions towards the end of the race. Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term, taking 38 of the 48 states. After the election, Willkie made two wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt's informal envoy, and as nominal leader of the Republican Party gave the president his full support. This angered many conservatives, especially as Willkie increasingly advocated liberal or internationalist causes. Willkie ran for the Republican nomination in 1944, but bowed out after a disastrous showing in the Wisconsin primary in April. He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming, after the war, a liberal political party, but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit. Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt vital political assistance in 1940, which allowed the president to aid Britain in its time of crisis."

  "text" : "William Calhoun \"Will\" Newland (1860–1938) was an attorney who served a term as the 11th Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina (1909–1913). A Democrat, Newland had previously served as mayor of his hometown, Lenoir, North Carolina, and was elected to terms in the North Carolina Senate (1881–1882) and in the North Carolina House of Representatives (1889–1890, 1903–1904). While in the General Assembly, Newland introduced and sponsored the bill that established Appalachian State University.In 1904, Newland lost a close race for Congress to E. Spencer Blackburn. The town of Newland, North Carolina was named after him as part of a political deal to secure his aid in passage of the bill that established Avery County in 1911. Newland is the seat of Avery County."

  "text" : "William Green T'Vault (1806–1869) was a pioneer of the Oregon Country and the first editor of the first newspaper published west of the Missouri River. T'Vault led a wagon train of 300 that arrived in Oregon in 1845, after traveling on the Meek Cutoff, a branch of the Oregon Trail. He settled in Oregon City, and was appointed Postmaster General by the Provisional Government of Oregon. T'Vault became president of the Oregon Printing Association, which was an outgrowth of the Oregon Lyceum, and published the first issue of the Oregon Spectator on February 5, 1846. He was fired from the Spectator after 13 issues. T'Vault claimed it was because of differences with other association members, especially George Abernethy, though the association claimed it because of T'Vault's poor spelling. T'Vault was a pro-slavery Democrat who became a member of the Provisional Legislature of Oregon in 1846. The same year he was part of a group that urged the United States Congress to disallow the land claims of earlier White residents of the region, including that of John McLoughlin at Willamette Falls. The petition was partially successful and McLoughlin's claim was not recognized. In 1851, T'Vault led an exploring party of ten people from Port Orford in order to seek an overland route to the interior of the region. The party was ambushed by Native Americans and five members were killed, but T'Vault survived. He moved to southern Oregon and established the Table Rock Sentinel newspaper in 1855, and later the Oregon Sentinel in 1858. T'Vault represented Jackson County in the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1858, its final year, and served as speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives during its first session, in 1858-59. He advocated for the formation of an independent Pacific Republic and also practiced law in Jacksonville."

However, Wilson found himself literally locked out of the mayor's office—he was told that the keys could not be found.

  "text" : "Yvonne Dorsey-Colomb (born August 19, 1952) is an American politician from the state of Louisiana. She represents the 14th district in the Louisiana State Senate as a member of the Democratic Party. She also served in the Louisiana House of Representatives, and was Speaker Pro Tempore. Dorsey-Colomb and her husband, Sterling Colomb, Jr., reside in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Sterling founded the Colomb Foundation to raise awareness of breast cancer. Though John Neely Kennedy, the state treasurer, listed the foundation as not adhering to state laws on disclosing their financial information, a later investigation found the foundation to be in compliance with all state laws. Dorsey-Colomb is listed among the state and local officials who endorsed the unsuccessful re-election in 2014 of Democrat U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu."
