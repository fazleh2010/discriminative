Yamamoto's party formed a majority government in the 39th Parliament and Premier Gordon Campbell included her in his cabinet, between June 2009 and October 2010, as Minister of State for Intergovernmental Relations, and then as Minister of State for Building Code Renewal between October 2010 and March 2011. Following the 2011 BC Liberal leadership election, in which Yamamoto endorsed George Abbott, the new Premier, Christy Clark, promoted Yamamoto to Minister of Advanced Education. Yamamoto has introduced one piece of legislation, the Advanced Education Statutes Amendment Act, 2011, which sought to implement several measures, including expanding the Personal Education Number system which tracks students in the BC educational system to also include private educational institutions, specifying that board members of colleges and universities are to act in the best interests of the institution, and updating the Architectural Institute of BC's dispute resolution process. The bill was introduced on November 3, 2011, but was not adopted before the winter break. Prior to her election to the legislature, Yamamoto owned and operated a business that started as a specialty shop for laser printing but evolved to focus on design and had created props for the television and film industry. She spent time on the governing boards of Capilano College, the North Shore Credit Union, the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, and the Gordon and Marion Smith Foundation. She completed one term as president of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce and worked as the president and general manager of the North Vancouver Chamber of Commerce from 2007 until she was elected as MLA."

Nasarudin Hashim (born 20 July 1950) is a Malaysian politician. A member of the Perak State Legislative Assembly, he is known for his key role in the constitutional crisis in the state in 2009. His defection from the People's Justice Party (PKR) to the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO)—days after he had defected the other way—helped cause the collapse of the Pakatan Rakyat government of which PKR was a component party. Nasarudin was first elected to the assembly in 2004, as an UMNO member representing the seat of Parit. He was re-elected to the assembly in 2008, albeit for a different seat, Bota. In the 2008 election, the Pakatan Rakyat coalition took power in Perak, consigning Nasarudin's UMNO to opposition for the first time in the state's history. On 25 January 2009, Nasarudin announced his defection to PKR, thus boosting the Pakatan Rakyat's narrow majority in the assembly. He claimed it was a \"brave\" decision that had the support of his constituents. His move was followed by the defection of eight UMNO branches in his constituency. However, in early February, Nasarudin defected back to UMNO. Joined by three other Pakatan Rakyat MPs, the defection gave the UMNO-led Barisan Nasional coalition the numbers to return to government. Nasarudin said his reversal was to ensure the \"stability\" of government in Perak."

Elected in November 1970, she first took office in January 1971, holding one of five seats (Position 1) in House District 13 (mostly in Lane County). With the implementation in 1972 of a reapportionment plan that replaced all existing Oregon House districts with new single-member districts, Fadeley represented new District 42 starting with the 1973 legislative session. In 1971 and 1973, she chaired the House Environment and Land Use Committee. During her tenure as the chair, the committee oversaw the passage of Senate Bill 100, Oregon’s pioneering, statewide land-use planning legislation, as well as the Oregon Bottle Bill. The passage of SB 100 prompted the formation of 1000 Friends of Oregon, a watchdog organization committed to the defense of, and advocacy for, the state's land-use program. Later she became a charter member and a national board member of the Older Women's League (OWL), a grassroots organization that advocates for women as they age. After her service in the Oregon Legislative Assembly, Fadeley began a career at the University of Oregon, where she was assistant vice provost. Fadeley was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She was married to Edward Fadeley for about 30 years, ending in 1984. During the 1970s, the couple both served in theOregon Legislature — Nancie in the House and Ed in the Senate. The mother of two children, Fadeley is now a freelance journalist who writes about Oregon history, environmental issues, and concerns of older women."

Carrington was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; he enlisted in the United States Army in 1953 and served as a paratrooper during the Korean War until 1955. Following his military service, he completed his high school education in 1957 and earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Widener College in 1962. Professionally, Carrington rose to become CEO of the Sirchie Group, a company specializing in evidence-collection gear for police and top-dollar security products for businesses. He was first elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1995. In 2005, Carrington was charged with illegally exporting evidence-collection gear to China and took a plea bargain in December 2005 to felony charges in which he has been fined $850,000. One of his companies also took a plea agreement in the matter. The law was altered to allow such exports a few years later. Many large companies have had to make files to track their resold goods to avoid penalty. The charge was for rape kits, finger print imaging kits, finger printing powder kits, and other evidence collecting products, etc. The effects were not sold directly to China, but were resold without the explicit knowledge of Carrington. Paper handling and documentation were handled badly by Carrington. However, under the law this circumstance was not an exception and a guilty plea was submitted."

He was elected in the 1988 federal election at the Beaver River electoral district for the Progressive Conservative party; however, he was terminally stricken with pancreatic cancer and never saw the first day of the 34th Canadian Parliament. Dahmer had entered Edmonton's Royal Alexandra Hospital on October 28, 1988, after suffering symptoms similar to adult onset type two diabetes, but the extent of his condition was not widely known until after election night. However, by the time cancer was discovered it was after the deadline to withdraw from the general election, and at that point it was not certain the cancer could not be successfully treated with chemotherapy. Dahmer died five days after the election, before the Deputy Clerk of the House of Commons could arrive to conduct a swearing-in ceremony. Despite this, parliamentary policy allowed Dahmer's widow to receive a $29,150 severance, which was equivalent to six months salary in office. This money was used to establish the John Dahmer Community Involvement Scholarship at Lakeland College. As of 2016, he continues to hold the record for the shortest term as a federal Member of Parliament in Canadian history."

Chosen as the leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party in 1996 following the resignation of Lynda Haverstock, Melenchuk was elected to the Legislature in the 1999 election. With the governing New Democrats in a minority government situation, the party entered a coalition agreement and all three Liberal MLAs — Melenchuk, Ron Osika and Jack Hillson — were appointed to the provincial cabinet. Melenchuk served as Minister of Education. The coalition was controversial among party members, however, and Hillson subsequently left to sit as an independent. Melenchuk stepped down as Liberal leader in 2001, and was succeeded by David Karwacki. Karwacki ordered Melenchuk and Osika to disband the coalition — however, both refused and officially left the Liberal caucus. They sat as independent MLAs until 2003, when they both ran for re-election as NDP candidates in the 2003 election. Both were, however, defeated by members of the Saskatchewan Party. In 2005, Melenchuk was named academic health sciences liaison between the Saskatchewan government and the University of Saskatchewan."

  "text" : "John \"Jack\" Richard Anthony Oldfield (5 July 1899 – 11 December 1999), was a British landowner and politician. The son of Major H E Oldfield of the Royal Field Artillery, his father was killed in action two days before his first birthday during the Second Anglo-Boer War. With his widowed mother he moved home many times, spending much time at Doddington Place Gardens, Kent, which had been purchased by his grandfather and aunt in 1906. Educated at Eton College, Oldfield was commissioned as an officer in the Grenadier Guards in the latter stages of the First World War. In 1920 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge he converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism. He also took an interest in social matters, and began voluntary work at Toynbee Hall in the East End of London and joined the Labour Party in the early 1920s. At the 1929 general election he was elected as member of parliament for South East Essex. With the formation of the Second Labour Government he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Air, Lord Thomson. Thomson was killed when the R101 airship crashed on its maiden voyage in October 1930, and Oldfield returned to the backbenches. With the formation of a National Government in August 1931 the parliamentary Labour Party was split, with supporters of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald forming the National Labour Organisation and the remaining MPs moving to the opposition benches. Oldfield chose to join the latter group, and when a general election was held in October 1931, was defeated with most of his Labour colleagues. He attempted to regain the seat in 1935 without success. Earlier in 1931 Oldfield had been elected to the London County Council to represent Whitechapel and St George's. He remained a member of the council until 1958, later representing Stepney and was vice chairman in 1954–1955. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939 Oldfield attempted to rejoin the forces, but was initially rejected due to his age. He eventually succeeded in enlisting as an able seaman in the Royal Navy. He finished the war with the rank of sub-lieutenant. In 1953 he married Jonnet Elizabeth Richards, and the couple moved to Doddington. There he created a mushroom farm while his wife worked on the gardens of Doddington Place. In 1964 he joined the Conservative Party and was elected to Kent County Council in the following year. He remained on the council until 1981. He died at Doddington aged 100 in December 1999, 68 years after leaving Parliament."

Immediately after his election in 2004, Entulu was appointed to the federal ministry as Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department. After the 2008 election he became Deputy Minister for Rural and Regional Development, and after the 2013 election was promoted to the full ministry as a Minister in the Prime Minister's Department.

Albert Richardson (c. 1938 – April 2, 2002) was a trade unionist and politician who was leader of the New Brunswick New Democratic Party from 1970 until 1976 save for a one month interruption in late 1971. A woods contractor in the Miramichi, Richardson became active in the union movement and was a staff representative with the Canadian Food and Allied Workers union (CFAW) and later served as secretary-treasurer of the New Brunswick Federation of Labour from 1981 to 1986. As NDP leader, Richardson was on the right wing of the party and opposed to the militancy of radicalized university students involved with the NDP. He criticized left winger NDPers who had protested the implementation of the War Measures Act during the 1970 October Crisis and was challenged by the New Brunswick chapter of The Waffle, a left wing faction in the NDP made up of Marxist students as well as older leftist activists. Under the leadership of veteran Fredericton socialist Pat Callaghan, the Waffle narrowly had its manifesto adopted by the New Brunswick NDP at a convention in the fall of 1971. The Waffle took over the party with Callaghan displacing Richardson as leader in October 1971. However, the federal party intervened and called a special convention the next month which routed the Waffle and restored Richardson as party leader. Richardson led the NDP through the 1970 and 1974 provincial elections in which the party ran seats in most of the province's ridings for the first time since the party's inception in 1960 but failed to win any seats or take the party above 3% of the popular vote. He stepped down in 1976 and returned to the union movement. He died on April 2, 2002."

  "text" : "Jeff Wilson (born c. 1978) is a Canadian politician who was an elected member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta formerly representing the electoral district of Calgary-Shaw. He was first elected in the 2012 provincial election as a member of the Wildrose Party, and currently remains a member of the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party. Wilson graduated from Harry Collinge high school in Hinton, Alberta. He completed a broadcasting diploma at Mount Royal College in Calgary in 2000. He worked in the communications field as an employee with AVW-TELAV, a North American audiovisual solutions company. Wilson served as president of the Broadcasting Society from 1999 to 2000 while attending Mount Royal college. An active member of his community, he has volunteered at Calgary’s Ronald McDonald House and with the Calgary Women’s Emergency Shelter. He is a member of the Standing Committee on Legislative Offices and the Standing Committee on Families and Communities. He also serves as a member of the Select Special Conflicts of Interest Act Review Committee. As a politician, Wilson has been known for his good humour after asking two government ministers \"Why are you so awesome?\" and the deputy premier, \"Why is your hair so awesome?\" during Question Period on the last day of the 2012 fall session. In the 2013 spring sitting, Wilson furthered his reputation for good humour when he gained access to the government whip's notepad and sent notes to Progressive Conservative MLAs while in the Legislative Assembly, some of which advised MLAs to more enthusiastically applaud their government colleagues. Wilson was an outspoken critic of changes to the funding model for persons with developmental disabilities in the 2013-2014 provincial budget, and called on the government to reduce administrative costs. On December 17, 2014, he was one of nine Wildrose MLAs who crossed the floor to join the Progressive Conservative caucus. Wilson lost his reelection campaign in 2015 to the NDP's Graham Sucha."

One of his first prominent actions as a city councillor was a speech protesting police harassment of participants in the city's 1924 May Day parade. In 1931, he built a public bathhouse at the corner of Bagg and St. Lawrence, which still stands today as the Schubert Bath (official French name: Bain Schubert). He served for three months as the city's acting mayor, commencing August 29, 1927, under mayor Médéric Martin. (Despite the title \"acting mayor\", however, he was never the city's official leader; in modern terms, his role would be more accurately understood as that of a deputy mayor or a mayor pro tem.) Until the appointment of Michael Applebaum as interim mayor in 2012, he was the highest ranking Jewish official in the history of Montreal's municipal government."

Manning was appointed to cabinet by Premier Paul Davis despite not holding a seat in the House of Assembly. Manning's appointment to cabinet came under fire due to her not being an elected member and because she was unwilling to seek a seat in the House of Assembly in three by-elections. Manning stated she intended to be the Progressive Conservative candidate in the district of Placentia—St. Mary's when that seat became available. The seat is currently represented by Felix Collins who had previously indicated he would not seek re-election. On March 12, 2015, Manning was removed from cabinet along with two other ministers. Davis cited cost savings as his reason for reducing his cabinet but also noted he was unwilling to have Manning serve in cabinet for up to a year without her holding a seat in the legislature. Davis said he had originally planned on calling a spring election but that was delayed till the fall by his government's decision to remove eight seats from he House of Assembly. It was later reported that when Manning was appointed to cabinet she and Davis were under the impression that Collins would resign his seat in the near future, creating a by-election for her to run in. However, Collins did not resign his seat and he found himself back in cabinet as Attorney General after Manning's departure due to him being the only lawyer within caucus."

Deveau defeated incumbent Richie Hubbard and former MLA Alex McIntosh to win the Yarmouth riding for the NDP in the 1998 provincial election, becoming the first New Democrat to ever win a seat in western Nova Scotia. As MLA, he was the NDP critic for Fisheries and Aquaculture. He was defeated by Progressive Conservative Richard Hurlburt when he ran for re-election in 1999. Deveau attempted to win back the seat in the 2006 election, but was again defeated by Hurlburt. In 2010, Hurlburt resigned as MLA, and Deveau won the NDP nomination for the by-election held to replace him. Deveau's attempt to win a seat in the NDP government was unsuccessful, as Zach Churchill won the seat for the Liberals. Deveau finished the by-election in fourth place, winning 6.5% of the vote."

Smith graduated with a medical degree from Dalhousie University in 1964. He practiced family medicine in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia for almost 30 years. Smith first attempted to enter provincial politics in the 1981 election, but was defeated by Progressive Conservative incumbent Richard L. Weldon. Smith ran again in the 1984 election, defeating Weldon by 903 votes to win the Dartmouth East riding. One of only six Liberals elected, Smith spent the early years of his political career in opposition. He was re-elected in the 1988 election, winning the seat by 253 votes. Smith was re-elected in the 1993 election, defeating cabinet minister Gwen Haliburton by almost 2,500 votes. Following the election, Smith would get to sit in government for the first time, as the Liberals under John Savage won a majority government. On June 11, 1993, Smith was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Community Services. On June 27, 1996, Savage shuffled his cabinet, with Smith being named Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs. On June 6, 1997, Savage announced that Smith would take over as Minister of Health on June 9, when Bernie Boudreau resigns from cabinet to run for the Liberal leadership. Smith remained as Minister of Health when Russell MacLellan took over as premier on July 18, 1997. Smith was re-elected in the 1998 election, and retained the health portfolio, but was also named Minister of Justice. In December 1998, Smith was replaced as Minister of Justice, as MacLellan shuffled his cabinet to reduce the heavy workload of some of the cabinet. Smith was re-elelcted by 265 votes in the 1999 election, but the Liberals were defeated by John Hamm's Progressive Conservatives. Smith served in opposition for one term, announcing on May 2, 2003, that he would not seek re-election in the next election."

  "text" : "Edson Jonasi Zvobgo (2 October 1935 – 22 August 2004) was a founder of Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF, was the Patriotic Front's spokesman at the Lancaster House in late 1979, a Harvard-trained lawyer, and a poet. His name is often misspelled by the media, either as Eddison instead of Edson or Zvogbo instead of Zvobgo. He was born in then Southern Rhodesia in 1935, near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo), where his father was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1960, Zvobgo won a scholarship to Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts aged 25. After taking a bachelor's degree there in 1964, he returned home to be arrested and detained for political activism against white rule in Rhodesia, along with Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo. Zvobgo was freed in 1971, and he spent a period in exile in Canada. He then studied law at Harvard and international relations at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, followed by a position as associate professor teaching criminal law at Lewis University College in Illinois. Zvobgo played a key role in international negotiations at Lancaster House that ended the bitter bush war and led to British-sponsored all race elections ahead of independence in 1980. He was the Zanu-PF spokesman, and impressed many in the international press with his quick repartee and astute analysis of the negotiations. In the 1980 elections, he won a seat in parliament for Masvingo, which he continued to hold until his death. An influential member of Zimbabwe's first fully independent cabinet, Zvobgo was minister for local government and housing until 1982, and minister for justice until 1985. As minister of parliamentary and constitutional affairs, in 1987 he made several amendments to the Constitution that concentrated power in the hands of the president and moved Zimbabwe towards a one-party state. Initially a staunch supporter of Zanu-PF policies, in later years he criticised Robert Mugabe's autocratic rule. In 1992 Zvobgo was moved to the less influential post of Minister of Mines. In 1996 he survived a car accident, in which both his legs were broken. This accident was considered suspicious by many. Shortly after the accident Mugabe demoted Zvobgo further to Minister Without Portfolio, and, in 2000, he was dropped from the cabinet altogether. In the 2002 presidential elections, he refused to campaign for Mugabe, but did not endorse the opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). He also voiced his opposition to the sweeping media law, passed the same year, calling it \"the most serious assault on our constitutional liberties since independence\". Despite his criticism, Zvobgo eventually voted for the legislation, which was used to close off Zimbabwe's only privately owned daily newspaper, The Daily News, and to arrest at least 31 independent journalists. He became the subject of an internal party disciplinary inquiry in 2003 for his refusal to campaign for Mugabe and after describing the laws as a weapon to stifle opposition to the government, but allegations of disloyalty were eventually dropped. Zvobgo had also been accused of holding private talks with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change as the ruling party abandoned formal dialogue between the two parties. Zvobgo died on 22 August 2004 after a lengthy battle with cancer. His wife Julia Tukai Zvobgo, a former Zanu-PF MP, died in February 2004 at the age of 67. He is survived by his seven children, Kerina, Edson Junior, Tsungirirai, Jonasi, Esther, Tendai and Farai Emily."

He defeated Liberal candidate Janice Laking, the incumbent mayor of Barrie, by a margin of 123 votes. Ironically, political analysts largely credited his victory over Laking to her popularity rather than his, suggesting that many voters in Barrie switched their votes only because they didn't want Laking to step down as mayor. Harper did not stand for reelection in the 1997 election. Before being elected to Parliament, Harper was a businessman in Barrie."

  "text" : "Ernest Fage (born August 15, 1953) is a Canadian politician, who represented the electoral district of Cumberland North in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1997 to 2009. First elected as a Progressive Conservative in a 1997 by-election, Fage served various cabinets as Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Minister of Economic Development, Minister of Human Resources, Minister of responsible for the Public Service Commission and Minister of Emergency Management. Fage was forced to take a leave of absence from the party caucus in January 2007 after allegations that he had engaged in criminal behaviour following a car accident on November 24, 2006. Fage was subsequently charged criminally with leaving the scene of an accident. Witnesses reported that Fage smelled of alcohol at the time of the accident, but he was not charged with an alcohol-related offense due to lack of evidence. He was found guilty of leaving the scene of an accident, and fined $800, on December 18, 2007, and it was subsequently announced he would not be allowed back into caucus. Prior to the verdict Fage said he planned on running in the next election. He continued to sit as an independent MLA until the 2009 election, when he was defeated by Brian Skabar — notably, however, Fage finished in second place ahead of Keith Hunter, his replacement as the Progressive Conservative candidate. He had also previously been involved in a controversy around a government loan to a potato farm with which he had a personal business connection."

In the general election later that year, however, Schafer and his New Democrat opponent Robert Bruce ended up tied with exactly 69 votes each, and Bruce was ultimately declared the winner by means of his name being drawn from a hat. Schafer challenged the results in court, and was successful in having the election overturned, but Bruce won the resulting by-election by a clear margin. Schafer is currently on the council of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation, having served on that body since 2003."

He was president of the Coal Creek Coal Company, president of the Virginia-Tennessee Coal Company, a director of Knoxville's Third National Bank, and at his height, was one of the wealthiest men in East Tennessee. His prominent North Knoxville mansion, Greystone, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A Union officer during the Civil War, Camp arrived in Knoxville in 1865. In 1868, he killed Confederate colonel Henry Ashby in a notorious shootout in downtown Knoxville. Camp first rose to prominence as U.S. District Attorney for East Tennessee, serving from 1869 until 1871. During the late 1860s, he organized the Coal Creek Coal Company, which in subsequent decades grew to become one of the major coal producing companies in the region.

  "text" : "Ensign Washer or Ensign Thos (Thomas) Washer was an early Virginia colonist who settled in the area that became Isle of Wight County, Virginia. Washer and Christopher Lawne represented Lawne's Plantation as burgesses in the first assembly of the Virginia House of Burgesses, the lower house of the colonial Virginia General Assembly, in 1619. \"Ensign\" is a military grade or rank, not the colonist's first name, and there is some suggestion that he was a lower ranking military officer before he arrived in Virginia. He also would have been a member of the local militia after his arrival in Virginia. Sources seem to be uniform in their identification of Washer as \"Ensign\" and only one source has been found which states that his name was \"Thos\" (Thomas). Even if this is true and can be verified, the colonist is shown as Ensign Washer here because that is how he is shown in sources which identify him as a member of the first session of the House of Burgesses. Before 1619, Ensign Washer, Captain Nathaniel Basse and Giles Jones received patents for land along the Pagan River. Captain Christopher Lawne then settled near the mouth of Lawne's Creek in the same vicinity. Although the area was known as Lawne's Plantation and its representatives were listed as representatives from the plantation, the colonists also had named the area \"Warresqueak County\" after the Native American tribe who lived there. Washer and Christopher Lawne represented Lawne's Plantation in the first assembly of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1619. In 1620, a movement began to change the name of \"Warresqueak County\" to \"Isle of Wight County\" but this was not done until 1637. The Daughters of the American Revolution state that Ensign Washer had a daughter named Margaret (Polly). Little if anything more is known about Ensign Washer or what may have become of him. Records do not show him as among the dead of the Indian massacre of 1622 nor do they list him in the muster of 1624. Yet his name survives as a member of the first representative assembly in the areas that would become both the State of Virginia and the United States of America."

He first ran as the party's candidate in Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing in the 2006 election, and subsequently ran in Sudbury in the 2008 election and the 2011 election. In both 2006 and 2008, Morin was the party's most successful candidate in number of votes received; in 2011, he was the party's only candidate. Morin was the Eastern Regional Representative for Aboriginal Students with the Canadian Federation of Students while attending university, and became politically active as president of the Young Liberals Association at Cambrian College. He later joined the FPNP, and was nominated as the party's first candidate for public office on December 28, 2005. In 2008, he argued that he was campaigning on a platform of aboriginal values, and fighting for the inclusion of aboriginal people in the political process. During the 2008 election campaign, he was excluded from an all-candidates debate on CIGM, and all four of the major party candidates — Liberal Diane Marleau, Conservative Gerry Labelle, New Democrat Glenn Thibeault and Green Gordon Harris — chose to boycott the debate rather than participate without Morin present. Although he received few votes, he said after the election that he accomplished what he set out to achieve. In 2006, Morin took part in a protest in support of a road blockade by the members of the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation in Brant. He later took part in a protest against the Canadian Pacific Spirit Train during the 2008 election. The Spirit Train was intended to raise support for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver; many protesters argued that the games were taking place on stolen native land."

He served as county commissioner for St. Lucie County from 1847 to 1852 and 1853 until Brevard County was broken off from St. Lucie in 1855. In 1854, Russell was elected to the Florida House of Representatives and served as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Russell introduced the legislation creating Brevard County, and naming it after his friend Theodorus W. Brevard in 1855."

Born in Singleton, New South Wales and educated at Shore School, Treatt interrupted his studies at the University of Sydney to enlist at the outbreak of the First World War. Serving in the Royal Australian Artillery, Treatt served in France and was awarded the Military Medal. Upon returning to Australia he was awarded a Rhodes scholarship and further educated at New College, Oxford. After briefly practising law in 1923 in Britain, Treatt returned to Australia and was admitted to the New South Wales bar that same year, serving as a Crown Prosecutor at the supreme court. Treatt also was the Challis law lecturer at the University of Sydney. Treatt entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 26 March 1938, representing the Electoral district of Woollahra for the United Australia Party (UAP). When UAP Premier Bertram Stevens was ousted from the leadership in August 1939 and Alexander Mair became Premier, Mair appointed Treatt, after serving only a few months in Parliament, as the Minister for Justice. He served in this office until the UAP lost power in 1941. During this time Treatt witnessed the break-up of the UAP into the various parties including the Democratic Party, which he joined, and then the establishment of the Liberal Party of Australia as the major conservative political force in Australia in 1945. When the second leader of the party, Alexander Mair, resigned in March 1946, Treatt was elected to succeed him. As the third leader of the new party, Treatt became the first leader to contest an election. After serving eight years and almost winning government at the 1950 election, Treatt resigned as Leader in August 1954 following a July attempt to depose him. He continued as a member of parliament until he was defeated in 1962 and thereafter served in various organisations and posts, including as a Chief Commissioner of the City of Sydney in 1969, until his death in 1984."

Irvin, and upon the expiration of Irvin's term, he was elected mayor by a large majority. He served two non-consecutive terms as mayor from 1918 to 1922, and from 1926 to 1930. Hodgson also ran for governor in 1920, but came third in the race, garnering only 81,293 votes. After Hodgson's death in 1937, his son, Laurence K. Hodgson, edited and published a book called \"Howdy Folks: Selections from the Writings, Verse and Speeches of Larry Ho.\""

He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Windsor, and a law degree (LLB) from Queen's University in Kingston. On graduation, he started his legal career in the city of Sault Ste. Marie's legal department, and for 25 years was self-employed in legal private practice in the Sault, specializing in municipal and planning law. He served as a charter member of the Algoma District Health Council, and for 13 consecutive years as a trustee on the Sault Ste. Marie Board of Education, where he served on all committees, including finance (chair) and salary negotiation. Provenzano was the past chair of the Northern Ontario Liberal caucus. After his election to Parliament in 1997 and re-election in 2000, he served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs, and was on several standing committees of the House of Commons, including fisheries and oceans (vice-chair), government operations and natural resources (vice-chair), and national defence and veterans affairs. He was also a member of the parliamentary steel caucus. As the Sault's MP, he considered his involvement in the successful restructuring of Algoma Steel a significant personal achievement. He was married to his wife Ada for nearly forty years, and together they had four children. Provenzano died from a sudden heart attack on July 27, 2005. His nephew Christian Provenzano ran unsuccessfully for the Liberals in his former riding during the 2006 federal election and the 2011 federal election, and was elected mayor of Sault Ste.

  "text" : "Chris Korwin-Kuczynski (born 1953) is a former Canadian municipal politician. He served as a councillor in Toronto from 1981 to 2003, and was the city's deputy mayor for a time. He was born in Toronto, and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from York University. He has been a director of the Polish-Canadian Congress, and has served as a special assistant to the federal Minister of State for Multiculturalism. He ran unsuccessfully for city council in 1980 as Chris Korwin but was successful on his second attempt, in a 1981 by-election. In 1992, Korwin-Kuczynski successfully urged that the music group Barenaked Ladies be banned from performing a concert in Nathan Phillips Square because he believed their name objectified women (Toronto Star, 20 July 2005). This decision was widely ridiculed, and gave considerable publicity to the then-obscure band. Korwin-Kuczynski was a member of the council's right-wing, and was a frequent ally of fellow councillor Tom Jakobek (Toronto Star, 29 November 1994). Kyle Rae has suggested that Korwin-Kuczynski became isolated on council when Jakobek left in 2000 (Globe and Mail, 16 September 2003). In 1993, Korwin-Kuczynski was removed as chair of the Toronto Board of Health after criticizing a strongly worded AIDS prevention pamphlet published by the AIDS Committee of Toronto (Toronto Star, 23 January 1993). He had suggested that the Committee, which received significant support from Toronto's gay community, be denied city funding if it continued publishing such materials (Globe and Mail, 25 January 1995). Referring to his dismissal after the vote, he commented, \"[t]he only real issue I think this all stems from is AIDS, the whole issue surrounding the gay issue\" (Toronto Star, 22 January 1993). Kyle Rae, who is openly gay, has said that Korwin-Kuczynski was anti-gay during the early 1990s but later changed his views. In 2003, Rae was quoted as saying, \"He's now generally supportive of these issues, but that didn't come easily.\" He opposed a 1996 municipal bill that banned smoking in restaurants and bars, and requested that provincial Premier Mike Harris veto the measure (Montreal Gazette, 8 July 1996). Korwin-Kuczynski considered running for the Liberal nomination in Parkdale—High Park in the 1997 federal election, but ultimately declined (Toronto Star, 16 February 1997). He retired from the council in 2003, amid rumours that he would move into consulting work (Toronto Star, 24 December 2003). He endorsed Dennis Mills's bid for re-election in the 2004 federal election, and a newspaper report from the period suggest that he was considering running as a Liberal candidate in the next federal election (Globe and Mail, 22 December 2003). On September 27, 2006, he filed papers to run in the Toronto municipal election, 2006 in Ward 14. However the next day he withdrew his nomination. This allowed him to retain a fundraising surplus of $21,742 leftover from his last campaign. If he hadn't done this the money would have flowed into the city coffers. Korwin-Kuczynski is a former honorary Captain of the Canadian Navy, and once served as a Director on the board of the Royal Canadian Military Institute in Toronto. His nickname is K-K."

In June 2015, Craig resigned as leader of the Conservative Party following allegations of inappropriate behaviour surrounding the party's former press secretary Rachel MacGregor and tensions with the party's governing board. Craig has since admitted to inappropriate conduct with MacGregor but has denied charges of sexual harassment. On 27 June, Colin Craig was formally suspended from the Conservative Party. Since then, his suspension has been invalidated which would enable Craig to contest the Conservative Party's leadership. On 16 November 2015, Craig announced that he would not be contesting the Conservative Party leadership in lieu of a police investigation against him over his Party's spending during the 2014 general election."

He was born in Joliet, Illinois on September 22, 1867, the son of William F. Stewart (b. Ohio) and Julia Ann Hutchins (b. Maysville, Kentucky). He married Annie Mabel Nash in Titusville on May 24, 1888. She was the daughter of Clarence and Annie Hyatt Nash, a wealthy family from Norwalk, Connecticut with a home in Daytona. He and his wife Annie Mabel Nash Stewart came to Melbourne in 1888. They were well educated and cultured, but wanted to be pioneers. He was elected mayor in 1890 when he was only 23. He opened a hardware store and mortuary on New Haven Ave named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Frank Fee, who would also serve as mayor. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee and Stewart founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. In 1908, he was a presidential elector for the Republican Party. Documentation exists from as early as 1898 in the form of letters and invoices, books and newspaper articles reflecting his business was already located at 1002 E New Haven Ave, Melbourne, FL. In 1919, Stewart's Front Street store burned down, along with most of the downtown businesses in \"The Great Fire.\" After this time, the downtown was no longer in that area, but moved to the west side of U.S. 1. Stewart moved his business to New Haven Avenue. He may have moved his business to 1002 E New Haven Ave before the fire of 1919. In 1920, he was a co-founder of the Melbourne Golf and Country Club. He died in Melbourne, Florida, on June 18, 1936. He was buried in Daytona Beach, Florida."

A Republican, he represented District 42. Born in Hinesburg, Vermont, McEwen lived in New York and Wisconsin before settling with his family in Minnesota in 1857. The family lived first in Hutchinson, where they owned a cheese factory and Charles McEwen held local office in McLeod County, and later in Boon Lake, where they set up the first cheese factory in Renville County. An abolitionist and a member of the Home Guard, McEwen was elected to the House of Representatives in 1892. Following his death, his son Bowman maintained the family farm, and served on the Renville County Commission. In 1906, Bowman's daughter Sarah moved with her husband Max Ramsland to Canora, Saskatchewan. Max was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in 1917, but died after less than a year in office during the 1918 flu pandemic; Sarah was then elected to the legislature as his successor, becoming the first woman ever to serve in Saskatchewan's provincial legislature."

Grummett was the only CCF MPP to survive both the 1945 and the 1951 provincial elections, which saw most CCFers defeated, including party leader Ted Jolliffe. He was the CCF's House Leader and led the two person caucus in the legislature from 1951, following Jolliffe's defeat, until new leader Donald C. Macdonald entered the legislature in the 1955. Grummett was defeated in the 1955 general election by Ontario Progressive Conservative Party candidate Wilf Spooner, who was mayor of Timmins, Ontario, when the Liberals failed to field a candidate allowing \"old party votes\" to coalesce around Spooner. The son of a farmer in Maxwell, Ontario, just south of Collingwood, Grummett was the first lawyer in Iroquois Falls-Ansonville, having attended law school in Toronto, Ontario. He and his wife Marie raised their five children in Iroquois Falls, Ontario. He had fought in World War I as an officer in the British Army where he saw action in the Mesopotamian campaign. While there he contracted malaria which affected him for the rest of his life. He died in 1967."

Wharton wrote: \"The funny thing is, of course, that socialists know that Barack Obama is not one of us. Not only is he not a socialist, he may in fact not even be a liberal. Socialists understand him more as a hedge-fund Democrat.\" The article led to increased media attention that resulted in multiple appearances on Fox Business News and a series of radio interviews including a segment on the CBC. Since then, Wharton's articles have consistently been published in on-line left-wing publications such as \"Counterpunch,\" the \"MRZine,\" \"Dissident Voice,\" \"In These Times,\" \"Counter Currents\" and \"The Indypendent.\""

  "text" : "Blake James Pedersen (born February 9, 1965) is a Canadian politician who was an elected member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, previously representing the electoral district of Medicine Hat. He was born at Gull Lake, Saskatchewan. He was first elected in the 2012 provincial election as a member of the Wildrose Party caucus. In the spring 2013 sitting of the Alberta Legislature, Pedersen put forward Motion 510 to restore a competitive tax credit system for film industry labour costs, which was supported by the Progressive Conservatives, NDP and Liberals. Motion 510 was the first Wildrose motion to ever pass in the Alberta Legislature. The proposal in Pedersen’s motion would replace the current system of awarding grants to film companies through the Alberta Multimedia Development Fund with a tax credit that would enable all companies to recoup a portion of their production costs. Pedersen was born and raised in Gull Lake, Saskatchewan, on the family ranch. Following graduation from Gull Lake High School, he moved to Vancouver as a drummer with a band, but returned to Gull Lake a few months later and entered the work force with a local oilfield services company. Experiencing his first of many boom and bust cycles, after one year of employment Pedersen participated in a 10-month agricultural exchange program to Australia with the International Agricultural Exchange Association. Upon his return to Canada, Pedersen returned to the oilfield services industry, and in 1999 became a small business owner. On December 17, 2014, he was one of nine Wildrose MLAs who crossed the floor to join the Alberta Progressive Conservative caucus. Pederson stood for reelection during the 2015 Alberta election but was defeated by NDP's Bob Wanner, finishing third."

  "text" : "U Lwin (Burmese: ဦးလွင်; 22 October 1924 – 6 December 2011) was a career army officer (ranked Colonel) in the Burmese Army and a National League for Democracy politician, who won a parliamentary seat in the Burmese general election, 1990, after contesting the Thongwa constituency. U Lwin was born in Rangoon's Pazundaung Township to parents Ba Tha and Thein. He first joined the Burma Independence Army in 1942 and served during World War II and in anti-rebel and anti-Kuomintang campaigns in the 1940s to 1950s, after Burma declared its independence. After martial law was declared in 1962, he served various roles including Minister of Finance, deputy prime minister and member of the Revolutionary Council under the Burma Socialist Programme Party, until his resignation in 1980. U Lwin is Secretary of the NLD and is a former party Treasurer. He was among the NLD representatives who boycotted the National Convention in December 1995 and is a former BSPP Deputy Prime Minister and member of the BSPP State Council.He completed high school in Rangoon before World War II and served in the Burma Independence Army (BIA), Burma Defence Army (BDA) and with the Patriotic Burmese Force (PBF) from 1942-1945. He completed BDA officer training at the Japanese Royal Military Academy and from 1952-1954 studied at the British Royal Military Academy. He was also the Military Attaché to the USA. U Lwin was put under de facto house arrest on 22 September 2000 and released on 1 December 2000.[ Member of CRPP, Chairperson of Committee for Health and Social Affairs ] U Lwin received 18,189 valid votes or 68 % in the 1990 elections.{ The only original member of the executive committee, who was left after 1990 to help U Aung Shwe in his struggle to keep the NLD intact through the years that threatened its viability as a political party, was U Lwin, the treasurer. U Lwin had joined the Burmese Independence Army as an 18-year-old boy at the outbreak of the war. In August 1943 he was among a batch of Burmese cadets chosen to go to Japan for training at the Rikugun Shikan Gakko (army academy). By the time the young Burmese officers had completed their training in April 1945, the anti-fascist resistance movement had started and U Lwin and his fellow graduates of the military academy remained in Hakone until October 1945, making charcoal which they sold to buy food. U Lwin continued with his career in the army after independence and was sent on training courses to England and West Germany. In 1959 he was sent to Washington as military attache. On his return from the United States he spent some years as deputy commander of Central Command, then commander of South Eastern Command before he was asked to come back to Rangoon to become a deputy minister. As the military government that assumed power in 1962 took on a civilian garb under the Burmese Socialist Programme Party, U Lwin served successively as minister of finance, deputy prime minister and a member of the state council. It was as a member of the state council that he resigned in 1980. U Lwin joined the NLD in 1988 and was appointed treasurer because of his experience in finances and his unquestioned integrity. In 1992, when the NLD was forced to reorganize its executive committee, U Lwin took on the post of secretary, while U Aung Shwe became chairman. He died of natural causes at his home in Yangon's Bahan Township on 7 December 2011. He was subsequently cremated at the Yayway Cemetery."

  "text" : "Thomas Michael \"Tom\" Apodaca is a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state's forty-eighth Senate district, including constituents in Buncombe, Henderson, and Transylvania counties. He was reelected in 2010. Tom Apodaca is a businessman and state legislator. He currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. His wife Lisa is a former public school teacher; they have been married for over 30 years and have two sons. All four Apodacas are graduates of Western Carolina University, where Tom served as a member of the board of trustees. Apodaca was elected to the North Carolina Senate in 2002 during his first campaign for public office; he was re-elected by his Western North Carolina constituents in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. In addition to chairing the Senate Rules Committee, he co-chairs the Committee on Insurance, the Committee on Pensions & Retirement and Aging and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Education & Higher Education. In response to public outcry after a coal ash spill into the Dan River in northern North Carolina from a facility owned by Duke Energy Inc., Apodaca said he planned to draft legislation in May 2014 to require Duke Energy to clean up its coal ash ponds, including the one in Buncombe County. He told the Hendersonville Times-News on February 12: \"I don't want a containment plan, I want a plan to get rid of it. ... We need a five- to 10-year plan to get rid of them because we don't need it sitting there next to the river.\" Over the court of his time in politics, Apodaca has accepted over $65,000 from organizations representing Duke Energy and Progress Energy. 61 In the 2013 legislative session, Apodaca introduced and voted for a bill, Senate Bill 10, to reorganize the Environmental Management Commission and the N.C. Utilities Commission and replace the members with new appointees. This Bill included the elimination of dozens of obsolete and rarely convened boards and commissions. Senate Bill 10 was not signed into law in 2013. Sen. Tom Apodaca said his main complaint to the House version was that it strikes language that would fire 12 special superior court judges. 60 In May 2013, after receiving the maximum $8000 contribution from North Carolina Automobile Dealers Association, Apodaca sponsored legislation that would make it illegal for any car maker to bypass dealerships and sell directly to consumers in North Carolina. Apodaca's proposal was widely criticized as anti-competitive and aimed at insulating automobile dealers from Tesla Motors' business model. In March 2016, Apodaca led a special session of the North Carolina General Assembly that passed the controversial Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act commonly known as HB2. After this session of congress, Apodaca called on the city of Charlotte to pay the $42,000 cost of the emergency legislative session which led to the bill's passage. After the controversial bill passed, companies such as PayPal withdrew their plans to expand in North Carolina, resulting in the loss of at least four hundred potential jobs for North Carolinians."

In 1786, he became a justice of the peace and, in 1792, was appointed to the land board for Leeds and Grenville counties. He was also the first sheriff in the Johnstown District. He represented Dundas in the 2nd Parliament of Upper Canada and Glengarry in the 5th Parliament. During the War of 1812, he commanded companies in the militia. After the war, he moved to Matilda Township in Dundas County. He was appointed to the Legislative Council for the province in 1815. He died in Matilda Township in 1821."

Longstreth, a graduate of Princeton University, was an eighth-generation Philadelphian born to Quakers William Collins (b. 1882) and Nella (née Thacher) Longstreth, who married in 1917. William C. Longstreth owned the Longstreth Motor Car Company and his family lived in Haverford, Pennsylvania, and was affluent until the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Thacher was a cousin of President Herbert Hoover and his maternal grandmother, Ella Hoover Thacher was the president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union for many years. In 1970, he led the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and spearheaded the drive to hold the annual Earth Day commemoration in Philadelphia. That event became one of the biggest Earth Day events in the nation. He was also instrumental in the creation of the Greater Delaware Valley Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. He was predeceased by his half sister, Nella Cameron Downward (1913-1997). His younger brother, Frank Hoover Longstreth (b. 1922) died in 2008. He was a two-time Republican nominee for Mayor of Philadelphia, first in 1955, losing to Richardson Dilworth, and again in 1971, losing to Frank Rizzo. He was initially elected to Philadelphia's City Council in 1967, resigning his seat to run for Mayor in 1971. While a member of City Council, he served as a sideline reporter on Philadelphia Eagles radio broadcasts on WIP in 1969 and 1970. Longstreth was again elected to Council in 1983, defeating incumbent councilwoman Beatrice Chernock for the at-large seat he had vacated twelve years earlier to run for Mayor. He would remain in office until his death. During his tenure on Council, Longstreth helped support the efforts of Edmund Bacon to bring an urban renaissance to Philadelphia. He was also well known for wearing bow ties and argyle socks. He suffered from Parkinson's disease, and died of a pulmonary embolism while on vacation in Naples, Florida."

He was appointed Assistant Minister for Sport and Racing on 3 April 2012. He was promoted to Minister of Housing and Public Works on 19 November 2012, following the resignation of Bruce Flegg. Following poor opinion polling, Mander initiated a leadership challenge against incumbent LNP leader Lawrence Springborg; he was shortly followed by former Treasurer Tim Nicholls. In the first round, Mander received 10 votes to Nicholls' 14 and Springborg's 17; he was therefore eliminated.

He came to Cranbrook around 1898 upon the completion of the Crowsnest Pass line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Caven was an employee of the Canadian Pacific Railway, a longtime railway conductor. A 1903 article stated that his property interests were largely a part of his money earned as a railway employee, noting that he \"[represented] the people that have made Cranbrook one of the flourishing and progressive towns of the province.\" In the British Columbia general election, 1903, he obtained the Conservative nomination for the provincial electoral district of Cranbrook, but he would ultimately lose out to Liberal James Horace King. After another defeat in 1907, Caven would eventually head to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, elected in 1909 and again, this time by acclamation in 1912. His term ended in 1916 when he was defeated again by James H. King. He attempted a return in 1920 as an Independent Conservative but he was defeated by King once again. He retired from the railway in 1923. In November 1906, Caven married Elizabeth Dickerson of Emporium, Pennsylvania. He was an active member of the freemasons, taking part in the Cranbrook Masonic Lodge, Royal Arch Masons and Seklirk Preceptory. Thomas Caven died suddenly February 20, 1926 at Vancouver. A newspaper report noted the \"profound shock\" that his death sent across the East Kootenay region, as it was not known that he was in ill health at the time."

  "text" : "Robert Hugh Carlin (February 10, 1901 – October 22, 1991) was a Canadian labour union organizer and politician, who represented the electoral district of Sudbury in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1943 to 1948. He was a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section) (CCF). Born in Buckingham, Quebec in 1901, Carlin moved to Cobalt in 1916 to work in the silver mines. He joined the Western Federation of Miners as a union representative, and was involved in the 1919 Cobalt Miners' Strike. He later began working at Teck Hughes in Kirkland Lake, but was fired in 1940 along with 36 other miners. He remained active as a union organizer, coordinating a major Labour Day demonstration against Teck Hughes in 1941. He subsequently moved to Sudbury, where he became president of Mine Mill Local 598, and won election to the Legislative Assembly in the 1943 election and was re-elected in the 1945 election. Following the 1945 election, the leadership of the CCF launched a purge of suspected Communists within the party and its supporters in the trade union movement attempted to eliminate suspected Communist influence in the union movement targeting, in particular, Mine Mill. National CCF secretary David Lewis and Charles Millard of the Canadian Congress of Labour decided to root the communists out of organized labour's decision-making bodies. Their first target was the CCF riding association in Sudbury, and its affiliated Mine Mill Local 598, even though the local was not under Communist control: out of 11,000 dues-paying members, very few were communists (less than 100). Over the next twenty years, a fierce battle was waged to take over Local 598 by Millard's United Steel Workers of America. Steel won. Carlin was loyal to his union, Local 598, putting him in conflict with CCF establishment in both Toronto and Ottawa. Charles Millard, Ontario CCF leader Ted Jolliffe, and David Lewis did not directly accuse Carlin of being a communist. Instead, they attacked him for not dealing with the perceived problem of communists in the Sudbury Mine Mill local. Local 598 was built by both Communists and CCFers, with the CCFers firmly in control of the executive. Carlin's first loyalty was to the men and women who helped build Local 598, regardless of their political affiliation. This is what got him in trouble with Lewis and Jolliffe. So Lewis and Jolliffe made the case to expel him from the Ontario CCF caucus at a special meeting of the CCF executive and the legislative caucus in Toronto on April 13, 1948. In essence, Carlin became a casualty of Steel's plans to raid Mine, Mill. The CCF lost the seat in the 1948 Ontario election, placing fourth to Welland Gemmell of the Progressive Conservatives. Carlin, running as an independent, finished a very close second. It wasn't until the CCF changed its name to the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Mine Mill/Steelworkers war was over in 1967, that another social democratic candidate — Elie Martel in Sudbury East — was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from the city. Carlin then stood as a Farmer-Labour candidate in the 1949 federal election in the federal riding of Sudbury, losing to Liberal candidate Léoda Gauthier but placing ahead of Willard Evoy, the CCF candidate. He subsequently returned to labour organizing in Sudbury, becoming a bargaining agent for the Steelworkers Local 6500 from 1962 until his retirement. On May 27, 1978, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws degree by Laurentian University. The degree was awarded for his pioneering work in the early days of the union movement in Northern Ontario. Carlin died in Sudbury at the age of 90."

  "text" : "Raymond Alexander \"Ray\" Stevens (born 1 February 1953) is an Australian politician who is the Leader of Opposition Business in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. Born in Townsville, Stevens is married with two children. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Finance and Economics from James Cook University and Macquarie University, and was admitted to the Australian Association of Accountants in 1974, being employed by Price Waterhouse in Sydney. He returned to the family station, \"Doncaster\" in Richmond, before moving to the Gold Coast in 1979. He ran local businesses in the area and was a councillor on Albert Shire Council from 1988 to 1994, serving as Mayor in 1994. After the amalgamation of Albert and Gold Coast, he was mayor of the latter from 1995 to 1997. Stevens, as member of the Liberal Party, was elected to state parliament in 2006 as the member for Robina, succeeding former state Liberal leader Bob Quinn. At this time he was also appointed as the Shadow Minister for Public Works and Housing from 2006–2009, with a brief stint from 2007–2008 as the Shadow Minister for Information and Communication Technology. In 2008, Stevens joined the new Liberal National Party with the rest of his party. The redistribution ahead of the 2009 state election renamed his seat to Mermaid Beach; he was re-elected. And from 2009–2010 he was the Shadow Minister for Tourism and Fair trading, before he continued in that role as the Shadow Minister for Tourism and Racing from 2010–2011. From early 2011 until the election in 2012 Stevens was the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Racing. With the Liberal National Party winning the 2012 Election, Stevens became the Leader of the House of Queensland and in October 2012 the Assistant Minister to the Premier on e-government. On 11 September 2012, Stevens sparked racism claims after using the term \"Jihad Jackie\" in Parliament to describe opposition spokeswoman Jackie Trad (herself of Catholic-Lebanese heritage). While Stevens withdrew the remark in Parliament upon urging by house speaker, he staunchly maintained using the word Jihad to describe someone of Arabic heritage, on 11 September, was nothing he needed to apologise for. He subsequently said Trad needed to \"harden up\" and had a \"glass jaw\". At a pre-polling booth on 21 January 2015, Stevens was filmed having a bizarre reaction to a journalist asking him questions about a $100 million sky rail project from Mudgeeraba to Springbrook. Stevens had previously stated he had approval from the Integrity Commissioner, but when the journalist asked Stevens for the Commissioner's advice to be released, Stevens refused to answer. When the journalist did not back down and asked how much he could make from the development, Mr Stevens then began to wave his hands and arms up and down in the journalist's face. \"That Mermaid Ray really lost the plot, but without saying a word,\" Donovan said.\"He started doing a dance and gyrating around — this is a Minister of the Crown, we're talking about, let me remind you.\""

Wynne was born in Canterbury, England, being baptized there on December 22, 1622. His grandfather, also Robert Wynne, had been mayor of Canterbury in 1599, and other relatives had served in Parliament. He settled in Charles City County, Virginia in early 1656, though he may have arrived in Virginia earlier. He served on the county court, though he was fined for poor attendance in September 1659. He also did not serve as a burgess in that year's assembly, though he did the years before and after. The House of Burgesses called by Sir William Berkeley in 1661 continued without dissolving until 1676, meeting in seventeen sessions during that period. At the second session in 1662, Wynne was elected as Speaker to replace Henry Soane, who had died during the recess. Under Wynne's leadership, the House took an active role in business previously left to the Governor and Council, creating a standing committee to advise the Governor between sessions. Wynne died in 1675; his will was dated July 1."

  "text" : "Sir Richard Nagle (1636 – 6 April 1699) was an Irish politician and lawyer. He held the positions of Attorney-General for Ireland, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, Lord Justice of Ireland and Secretary of State and War for Ireland under King James II. He fled to France in 1691, joining James II at Saint Germain, where he resumed his duties as nominal Secretary of State and War. He later served as Commissioner of the Household. Richard was born into an Old English family at Carrigacunna Castle, in County Cork, the son of James Nagle of Annakissy, and James' wife, Honora Nugent. This was his family's seat. His brother Pierce was a future High Sheriff of Cork. Although Richard was initially destined to join the clergy, he was educated in law at Gray's Inn and was called to the bar in Dublin. \"Active and skillful\", he had a successful career as a lawyer. The Earl of Tyrconnell brought Richard to England with him in 1685 to meet James II. James created him Attorney-General for Ireland and knighted him in 1686. He also appointed him to the Privy Council of Ireland. As an MP for Cork, Nagle was elected Speaker by the Irish House of Commons in 1689. This parliament is known to posterity as the \"Patriot Parliament\". It spurned the outcome of the Glorious Revolution, recognising King James's divine right to the Irish crown over William of Orange's parliamentary one. William, made King of England during the revolution, was set on conquering Ireland from James, and to achieve that end he launched the Williamite War. Richard was diametrically opposed to the Act of Settlement 1662 (he was the author of A Letter from Coventry, an anti-settlement pamphlet), which had punished royalists and Catholics who had fought against parliament in the Civil Wars; he unsuccessfully advocated its repeal in this session. James's forces were routed by William's at the Battle of the Boyne, in 1690; King James retreated to Dublin. It was here he convened a council that advised him to flee to France. Nagle was one of its members. They reasoned that if he did not leave \"he would run a great risk of being taken by the enemy\". James followed their advice. Nagle, accompanied by Tyrconnell, visited him at his court-in-exile, Saint Germain, at the end of 1690. In Nagle's absence, his duties as Secretary of State were executed by the Baron Nugent of Riverston. Upon the death of Tyrconnell, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Nagle became one of the Lords Justice of Ireland. The others were Francis Plowden and Baron Fitton of Gawsworth. They administered what remained of Jacobite Ireland in the place of the Lord Lieutenant, though they did not assume command of the armed forces. Sir Richard Nagle married Jane (Joan) O'Kearney on September 19, 1669 at Clonbrogan, Ireland. Jane's sister, Mary O'Kearney, married Sir Richard's brother, Pierce Nagle of Annakissy, the high sheriff of County Cork in 1689."

In his 2001 campaign, he defeated music critic, monorail booster and author Grant Cogswell. In a film about that campaign, Grassroots, McIver was played by Cedric the Entertainer. McIver chaired the City Council’s Housing & Economic Development Committee. He was vice-chair of the Environment, Emergency Management and Utilities Committee and was a member of the Transportation Committee. He was an alternate member of the Energy & Technology Committee. (From 2004 through 2007 he was the chair of the Council’s Budget & Finance Committee.) McIver was strongly identified with Rainier Valley, one of Seattle's poorer neighborhoods. According to at least one obituary, his greatest achievement in office was the creation of a $50 million Rainier Valley Community Development Fund, and he was \"deeply worried\" about Link Light Rail impacting \"immigrant- and minority-owned businesses along Rainier Avenue.\" During the protests surrounding the Seattle World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999, McIver, on his way to an official dinner, was, according to fellow councilmember Jean Godden, \"stopped by a Seattle policeman who did not recognize him as a council member, refused to believe he was a public official, and insisted on making him stand spreadeagled up against his car.\" \"He never forgot that, not so much because of the indignity to him, but that others did not believe an African American might be a city councilmember.\" McIver died on March 9, 2013, at the age of 71 in Seattle."

  "text" : "Raef al-Maarri was an officer in the Syrian Army and a deputy of Colonel Jassem Alwan. Politically aligned with the Nasserists, supporters of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, Maarri and Alwan orchestrated a failed coup attempt against the Ba'athist-dominated government that took power in the coup d'état of 8 March 1963, which toppled the secessionist government of Nazim al-Qudsi and Khalid al-Azm. The latter two themselves gained power after a coup that ended the union with Egypt in the United Arab Republic. The Nasserists were major participants in the 8 March coup, but were increasingly sidelined by the Ba'athists who executed a mass purging of Nasserists and political independents beginning in late April. Maarri and Alwan planned a counter coup against the Ba'athists with the aid of the Arab Nationalist Movement in Syria and Egyptian intelligence. The insurrection was launched on 18 July, but was violently quelled by the security forces led Amin al-Hafiz, the Ba'athist Interior Minister. Several Nasserist officers were arrested and executed in the immediate aftermath, but Maarri managed to flee the authorities and went into hiding in the Ghouta countryside of Damascus with Alwan. After being discovered and apprehended, both were tried by a military court where Maarri plead guilty to his role in the abortive coup, stating it was an attempt to ensure the unification process with Egypt and Iraq would continue in light of the Ba'athists' perceived anti-unionist actions. Maarri was sentenced to death, but the sentence was later reduced to life imprisonment on 10 December. He was released a year later in December 1964 with Alwan and several other alleged participants in the July coup in an amnesty agreement. Afterward, the men were escorted to the border with Lebanon from which they departed for the Egyptian embassy in Beirut to seek asylum in Egypt, which Egypt granted."

Fiske resigned from cabinet prior to an August 1973 cabinet shuffle, and did not seek re-election in 1974. He later served as Chairman of the Nova Scotia Gaming Commission. Although forced to resign due to indiscretions between the Halifax Casino and the government at the time, his claims were found to be truthful. \"When Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation's former chairman Ralph Fiske's wrongful dismissal suit went to trial last May, one canny Halifax lawyer voiced surprise that Fiske planned to call only two witnesses: himself and former finance minister Bill Gillis. Arrayed against him were seventeen members of Nova Scotia's political, bureaucratic, and legal establishment: former premiers, cabinet ministers, and deputy ministers from the premier's office; officials of the gaming corporation; and a clutch of Liberal lawyers from the province's best-connected law firms. Yesterday, Fiske touched home plate in near total victory. Gruchy found that political interference in the gaming corporation's administration of the Sheraton Casino project rendered Fiske's position untenable and forced him to resign. Nova Scotian's should celebrate this moment, rare in our recent history, when a lone civil servant proved that courage and integrity can overcome the mediocrity that corrupts governance in this province. When future civil servants are forced to choose between doing the right thing and the politically easy thing, Fiske's example will beckon them toward duty\""

He was the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory under chief minister Adam Giles from 2013 to 2014. Tollner was born in Biloela, Queensland, and worked as a manager and company director before entering politics. He contested the 1997 territory election as an independent, narrowly losing to CLP candidate Chris Lugg in the seat of Nelson. He subsequently won the new federal seat of Solomon for the CLP at the 2001 federal election, and was re-elected at the 2004 election. He was narrowly defeated by Labor candidate Damian Hale at the 2007 election. Tollner then contested the 2008 territory election, winning the new seat of Fong Lim and defeating Labor minister Matthew Bonson. He was re-elected at the 2012 election, and upon the CLP's victory was appointed Minister for Health, Minister for Alcohol Rehabilitation and Policy, and Minister for Housing. In March 2013, Mills expelled Tollner from his cabinet after a heated disagreement between the two at a party meeting. According to former MLA Daryl Manzie, Tollner swore at Mills and threw a stack of cabinet papers at him before walking out of the room. Tollner was appointed deputy chief minister of the Northern Territory on 13 March 2013. He caused controversy in August 2014 when he referred to the gay son of fellow CLP MP Gary Higgins as a \"pillow biter\" and \"shirt lifter\". As a result, it was announced that Tollner's resignation as deputy leader of the CLP had been accepted. Despite that, Tollner said a few days later that he wanted to be restored to his former position or he would quit the party, leaving it in a precarious position on the floor of the Legislative Assembly. On 1 September, Chief Minister Adam Giles threw open the leadership and deputy leadership to a party room ballot. Giles was re-elected as CLP leader, and Peter Chandler was voted in as his deputy. A redistribution ahead of the 2016 election all but erased Tollner's majority in Fong Lim, slashing it from a fairly safe 7.3 percent to an extremely marginal 0.2 percent. Tollner tried to transfer to the newly created seat of Spillett, which had absorbed much of the eastern portion of Fong Lim. However, he lost a November 2015 preselection battle to Lia Finocchiaro, the member for neighbouring Drysdale. His senior advisor, Tim Dixon, was pre-selected for Fong Lim, but lost the seat to Labor."

As a city councillor, Atchison suggested a part of downtown Saskatoon should be enclosed by a $80 million 10-storey climate-controlled glass atrium, dubbed the \"Atreos.\" He also is known to be precise about his dress, as he owns a men's clothing store. On his first election as mayor, he required citizens visiting the Mayor's office to be formally dressed, a policy that was soon dropped after being criticized. Both points were ridiculed by CBC satirist Rick Mercer who sponsored an online contest that went on to name Atchison \"Canada's Craziest Mayor.\""

He obtained an undergraduate and graduate degree from the University of British Columbia in political science and public administration, returning to the Williams Lake area, where he became a cattle rancher and a practitioner of horse logging. He was also active as a consultant in various federal, provincial, and First Nations projects related to public policy and economic development. Zirnhelt began his political career when he served as a director of the Cariboo Regional District from 1974 to 1977. In 1987, he was elected as a trustee of the Cariboo-Chilcotin School District. Zirnhelt made the leap to provincial politics in 1989, winning the seat of Cariboo in a by-election for the social democratic British Columbia New Democratic Party. The riding had, until then, been a stronghold of the conservative British Columbia Social Credit Party for almost forty years. Zirnhelt would go on to be re-elected in 1991 and 1996 in the riding of Cariboo South (the old Cariboo riding was abolished with the 1991 election). With the election of a New Democratic government in 1991, Premier Mike Harcourt appointed Zirnhelt Minister of Economic Development, Small Business and Trade. He later served as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food. Following Harcourt's resignation, Premier Glen Clark appointed Zirnhelt Minister of Forests — a powerful portfolio in a province where forestry is a major economic sector. In that position, Zirnhelt initiated an intensive review of the province's forest practices, as concerns mounted over the logging of old growth forests and the insufficient restocking of logged areas by timber companies. Zirnhelt failed in his attempt at re-election in 2001."

Tanner Creek, which flowed by the site in the mid-19th century, was named after the tannery. Lownsdale served as a member of the Provisional Legislature of Oregon in 1846. Lownsdale purchased the land that would become downtown Portland on September 22, 1848. He resurveyed Portland, keeping the small blocks (200 feet per side, 64 feet streets), and adding the contiguous park blocks. He became involved in a land dispute involving the authority of the laws from the Provisional Government with Josiah Lamberson Parrish. Lownsdale would defend the matter in court in a case that would make its way through the Oregon Supreme Court and to the United States Supreme Court in Lownsdale v. Parrish, 62 U.S. 290 (1858). Lownsdale is buried in the Salem Pioneer Cemetery."

She was elected to the State Parliament as the Member for Perth in 1993, succeeding Dr Ian Alexander who had retired. She was re-elected in 1996 but did not contest the February 2001 election. Her political career was entirely from the opposition bench, during the premiership of Richard Court. Warnock served as Opposition whip, spokesperson for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs and the Arts and spokesperson for Women's Interests and Racing & Gaming. She also served as President of the State Parliamentary Labor Party. In 1996, Warnock and upper house MP Cheryl Davenport steered a controversial pro-choice bill through the parliament—the \"Acts Amendment (Abortion) Bill\", which effectively decriminalised abortion and enabled women to access abortions of pregnancies up to 20 weeks on the basis of informed consent. In 1999 she was named the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies. As of 2013, she is the current patron of the Friends of Perth International Arts Festival. Warnock was married to local novelist, playwright and arts patron Bill Warnock, who died in 2001."

Later, O'Connor travelled north where he founded the town of Temagami and opened Lady Evelyn Hotel, the Temagami Inn and Ronnoco Hotel. When O'Connor moved to Temagami, he was hoping to find some mineral prospects. In 1899, O'Connor created test pits in east-central Strathy Township that later became Big Dan Mine, which is named after him. Other mines in Temagami that bare his name are Little Dan at Arsenic Lake and O'Connor near Lake Temagami. O'Connor continued to move northwards where he discovered deposits of gold. On March 30, 1933, O'Connor died in the city of Timmins where he was living with his family. The cause of his death was bronchopneumonia."

She later returned to Memorial University of Newfoundland to study nursing. Wyatt first won election to St. John's City Council in 1969 as the city's first female alderman. She ran for the mayoralty in 1973, winning the election and serving two terms in office. Her term as mayor was marked by accomplishments including the city's hosting of the Canada Summer Games in 1977, a shift from rental-value to capital-value municipal tax assessment, the adoption of a ward system for city council elections, and the construction of many of the city's modern office buildings. Wyatt was defeated by John Joseph Murphy in the 1981 election. She was later reelected as a councillor at large in 1985, and remained a sitting member of city council until her death; she died just two days before the city's 2001 municipal election, and was posthumously reelected to her seat on September 25. A by-election was held on November 27 of that year, and was won by Sandy Hickman. She was a candidate for provincial office twice, running as an independent candidate in St. John's Centre and later for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador in the party's 1979 leadership convention. In the PC race, she garnered no votes (she didn't even vote for herself, admitting that she had run more \"to shake things up\" than out of a serious desire to actually lead the party) and was eliminated on the first ballot. Wyatt revelled in a quirky and offbeat public image, once telling a reporter that she hoped to be classified \"as a freak, I suppose\"."

Dickieson was a popular politician during his term, even among non-New Democrats, as a voice for change. He was pressured by many members to run for the federal New Democratic Party in the 2004 federal election and again provincially, he had refused until he announced on September 12, 2014 that he would seek the NDP nomination for Egmont for the 2015 federal election. Dickieson was nominated as the candidate in October 2014. On October 19, 2015, Dickieson was defeated in the election, finishing third behind the winner, Liberal Bobby Morrissey and Conservative incumbent Gail Shea.

  "text" : "Herbert Arthur Sinnott (January 7, 1871 – after 1923) was a Canadian educator, lawyer and municipal politician who served as the 18th mayor of Calgary, Alberta from 1913 to 1915. Sinnott was born in Kings County, New Brunswick on January 7, 1871 to David S., a farmer, and Frances (née Taylor) Sinnott. After attending schools in Sussex, New Brunswick, Sinnott graduated from Mount Allison University with a Bachelor of Arts and started his teaching career in Gagetown as principal of a grammar school. He later taught high school in Moncton, New Brunswick before moving west to Alberta in 1900. In 1903, he became a high school principal in Calgary, the first ever to the city. He began a career in law in 1908, articling under Thomas M. Tweedie. In 1911, he was called to the bar. Around this time, Sinnott also owned and rented out various properties in the city of Calgary as well as Lethbridge. He also served on the Calgary School Board as trustee in 1912 and 1920–22 along with chairman from 1908–11 and 1918–19. Sinnott was elected as Mayor of Calgary and served in this position from January 2, 1913 to January 2, 1915. During his time in office, oil was discovered within the city of Calgary, and it was said that the \"[whole city] quickly became oil conscious\". In January 1923, Sinnott pleaded guilty in a court to \"misappropriating clients' trust funds\" during his work as a lawyer in Calgary. During his trial, Sinnott admitted his guilt and was sentenced to seven years to be served in a Prince Albert, Saskatchewan jail. The magistrate had expressed that \"the more grievous\" crime that of the betrayal of trust of Sinnott to his clients, and that it was unfortunate that such a citizen of high of esteem, had admitted to committing the crimes. The magistrate also expressed that the punishment was decided to set a precedent and to \"deter others from doing the same thing\", along with restating that though it was hard to see \"a citizen of Mr. Sinnott's calibre\" take the sentence, it was a necessary justice. It is not known where Sinnott went after presumably leaving prison, although there have been rumours that he may have moved to Australia shortly thereafter. He married Margaret Horne, a graduate nurse and daughter of a sea captain, in 1901 and had one child with her, Margaret. His wife died in 1906. A conservative in politics, during his time in Calgary, Sinnott was a member of the Ancient Order of Foresters in Calgary as well as the Methodist church. Sinnott was widely regarded for his work in the educational field, with a 1912 biography beginning with \"The educational annals of the Northwest present few names which shine with a brighter luster of good deeds done than the one which forms [this paragraph]\"."

He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1956 and 1960. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1963, where he served until his election to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1966. He eventually attained the chairmanship of the powerful Appropriations Committee from which position he worked closely with Speaker of the House Herbert Fineman to appropriate money to Philadelphia. In 1977, Cianfrani was convicted on federal charges of racketeering and mail fraud for padding his Senate payroll. His case was prosecuted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by U.S. attorney David W. Marston, who was later removed from the position by U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Cianfrani was sentenced to five years in federal prison. After serving for twenty-seven months, he was released in 1980. In the middle 1970s, he began dating political reporter Laura Foreman of The Philadelphia Inquirer. The two moved in together and she reportedly accepted money and gifts from him while she was still reporting on him for her newspaper. After the affair became public in 1977 she was fired by her employer, The New York Times. She and Cianfrani married in 1980, after his divorce from his first wife was finalized and he was released from federal prison. Years after his release, his political career enjoyed a resurgence. In 1988 Cianfrani won back his old position as Philadelphia ward leader and regained a measure of clout within Philadelphia politics. He was considered a mentor to many Philadelphia politicians, including Congressman Bob Brady and Senator Vince Fumo. Cianfrani died of a stroke in Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 3, 2002."

He was an associate member of all of the Crime Stoppers chapters in Saskatchewan, and the founder and past director of Teen Challenge Saskatchewan.

She was born in Boon Lake, Minnesota, the daughter of local politician Bowman C. McEwen and the granddaughter of Minnesota Representative Charles D. McEwen. Trained as a schoolteacher, she married Max Ramsland, the son of Minnesota politician Ole Ramsland, in Buffalo Lake, Minnesota in 1906 and moved to Saskatchewan, settling first in Canora and later in Buchanan and Kamsack. Max Ramsland was elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 1917 provincial election as the Liberal MLA for Pelly, but died in 1918 in the Spanish flu epidemic, and Sarah Ramsland was elected to succeed him in the resulting byelection. Early in her term she was invited by Premier William Melville Martin to second the formal motion to accept a Speech from the Throne, but declined the honour. Ramsland was reelected in the 1921 election, and served until 1925. A backbench MLA, she rarely spoke in the legislature and was not prominent in the government until her final day in the legislature, when she introduced a resolution calling for an amendment to federal divorce laws that would permit women to apply for divorce on the grounds of a spouse's adultery, a privilege which was then only available to men. She was defeated in the 1925 provincial election by Progressive candidate Charles Tran. She subsequently worked for the provincial library and for a number of women's organizations. In 1942, she married Regina businessman William George Franklin Scythes. She died in Prince Albert in 1964, at the age of 81."

He was re-elected to the Legislature, this time in the newly created riding of Vancouver-West End in the May 13, 2009 general election. Chandra Herbert's BC NDP formed the Official Opposition in both the 38th and 39th Parliaments and he was assigned to be the party's critic on tourism, arts and culture. He has introduced several pieces of legislation as private members' bills, though none have been adopted. The Long Term Tenants Protection Act, and his more comprehensive Residential Tenancy Amendment Act, were meant to address evictions and high rent increases that were occurring in the West End. He also introduced the Consumer Protection in Ticket Sales Act, 2009 which would have made ticket scalping illegal and the Gender Identity and Expression Human Rights Recognition Act which would have included gender identity and gender expression into the BC Human Rights Code as characteristic protected from discrimination. He entered the 38th Parliament at age 27, as its youngest Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and remained the youngest throughout the 39th Parliament. Prior to becoming a MLA, he was elected to the Vancouver Parks Board. He served as a Parks Commissioner between 2005 and 2008 and was then a member of the Coalition of Progressive Electors. On the Parks Board he voted against removing the requirement for a referendum on an expansion of the Vancouver Aquarium but later voted in favour of the expansion. He advocate for bicycle valet service at large public events, investigating environmentally friendly means of disposing of animal waste, and implementing a zero-net-loss of greenspace policy. He is openly gay and married his partner, Romi Chandra, in March 2010. Afterwards, he legally changed his name to Spencer Chandra Herbert. Both Spencer and Romi have been active supporting causes within the LGBT community. At the provincial level, Chandra Herbert has advocated for a community victim services worker in Davie Village, a specialized telephone line for people to call to report incidents involving gay-bashing or verbal and physical assaults, and for school boards to include LGBT issues, especially in anti-bullying lessons."

  "text" : "(For those of a similar name, see Susan Davis (disambiguation).) Susan Margaret Davies (born 14 March 1954) is a former Australian politician. She was born in Mirboo North, Victoria, to parents Richard Llewellyn (dec) and Jean Margaret Davies (dec). She attended Leongatha High School (1966–70) and Watsonia High School in 1971, when she completed her Higher School Certificate. She received a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education in 1976 from Latrobe University. She subsequently became a secondary school teacher, and began farming in addition to this in 1989. Davies joined the Australian Labor Party in 1993, as part of the rural protest against Kennett government funding and service cuts, and was the Labor candidate for Gippsland West in the 1996 Victorian state election. Sitting Liberal MP Alan Brown resigned less than a year after the state election, precipitating a by-election. Labor declined to stand a candidate for this very safe Liberal seat; it and its predecessors had been in the hands of a conservative party for more than a century and a half. Davies resigned from the Labor Party and contested the by-election as an independent, emerging victorious. She retained her seat in the 1999 state election, and held the balance of power with two other rural Independents when a significant, mostly rural, and very anti-Kennett-government swing led to a hung parliament. Davies played a key role in developing the \"Independents' Charter\", which the three independents used as a basis for backing Steve Bracks and the Labor Party as the new minority government. She served on the Public Accounts and Estimates committee during the following parliamentary term. Prior to the 2002 election, Gippsland West was essentially replaced by the newly created seat of Bass, which was notionally Liberal in a traditional matchup. Davies contested Bass, but lost to the Liberal candidate, former MLC Ken Smith. She later rejoined the Labor Party and contested the 2004 federal election as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of La Trobe. She was defeated by the Liberal candidate, Jason Wood. Davies now runs a small farm in South Gippsland, is part of a local food producers' network and Korumburra Landcare, and is a director on several organisations, including Chairing Energy Innovation Co-operative Ltd, which promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency measures as a response to climate change and peak oil."

  "text" : "Stan Lawlor (born August 4, 1943 in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador) is a Canadian politician and academic, who served as Mayor of North Bay, Ontario from 1984 to 1994. Educated in sociology at Memorial University of Newfoundland and the University of Alberta, Lawlor began teaching at Nipissing University College in 1967. He was first elected to North Bay City Council in 1973, and served as a city councillor until his elevation to the office of mayor, including serving as deputy mayor after 1978. He was appointed mayor in June 1984 following the death in office of Merle Dickerson, and was subsequently elected as mayor in the municipal elections of 1985, 1988 and 1991. His term in office was marked by initiatives that included the acquisition of the Dionne Quintuplets homestead as a community museum, the creation of a heritage train attraction in the city's Waterfront Park, the launch of \"Haleyfest\", a Christmas choral concert which still takes place annually in the city, and other economic development initiatives to revitalize the city's downtown and waterfront areas. During his term as mayor he also ran as an Ontario Liberal Party candidate in Nipissing in the 1990 provincial election, but lost to Mike Harris. He ran for another term as mayor of North Bay in the 2006 municipal election, but was defeated by incumbent mayor Vic Fedeli. Lawlor retired after teaching for nearly 45 years at Nipissing University. His son Sean Lawlor is also a former North Bay city councillor and deputy mayor. Since his retirement from Nipissing University, Lawlor has remained active as a consultant throughout Northern Ontario."

He was born in Hamilton City, (which at the time was a part of Colusa County) the son of Edward Tillotson Reynolds and Frances Elizabeth Barnard Reynolds who were early settlers of Colusa County. Reynolds attended Woodman’s Academy in Chico, and Chico State Normal School, to which he enrolled at the age of seventeen, and continued for two and a half years. He then quit school to work in the fruit and nut business with his father, in 1898, when the firm of E. T. Reynolds and Son was established. Initially, they leased a warehouse, and eventually they bought a warehouse at the corner of First and Cedar Streets in Chico. In 1902, they built another warehouse, which had a railroad spur adjoining it at First and Cherry Streets. This warehouse still existed into the 21st-century, and was part of the Chico State campus under the same name as \"Reynolds Warehouse.\" By 1915, they were the largest handlers of almonds in the state. Their dried fruit business grew to the capacity of thirty-five hundred tons annually. Reynolds, with in partnership with others, owned the Cana Land Company, which comprised two hundred acres of fruit and nuts at Cana. Reynolds married Helen Adelia \"Nellie\" Davisson, in Suisun, in 1908. She was a Chico Normal School graduate, and school teacher until her marriage. In 1915, he was elected from the third ward as a trustee of the city. He served as chairman of the commission on fire, light and water. In 1919, he was elected president of the board of trustees. On June 4, 1921, an election was held to choose a Board of Freeholders charged with framing a City Charter. On April 16, 1923, at-large elections were reinstated under the charter. Under the charter, the board of trustees was renamed the Chico City Council, and its chair was titled the Mayor. Reynolds was the last mayor to be titled \"president\" of the \"board of trustees\" before it became the modern Chico City Council."

  "text" : "Marianne Cerilli (born 1961) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She served as a New Democratic member of the Manitoba legislature from 1990 until 2003, though she was not called to cabinet when the party formed government in 1999. Cerilli was born in Toronto, raised in Winnipeg, and was educated at the University of Manitoba (from which she holds a B.P.E. and a Bachelor of Education degree). Before entering political life, she worked as a high school athletics coach, and was a counsellor in the Winnipeg School Division. She also worked at the Unemployed Health Centre of Winnipeg, and was a consultant to Manitoba Employment and Youth Services for three years. Cerilli initially intended to run for the NDP in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Broadway in the 1990 provincial election, but lost the party nomination to Conrad Santos by one vote. She instead ran in the northeast Winnipeg riding of Radisson, where she defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Mike Thompson by almost 1500 votes (incumbent Liberal Allan Patterson finished third). The Progressive Conservatives won the general election, and Cerilli joined nineteen other New Democrats in the official opposition. At the time she was the youngest woman ever elected to the Manitoba legislature. Cerilli was re-elected in the 1995 provincial election, defeating Liberal Art Miki by 4891 votes to 2401. The Progressive Conservatives won the general election again; during her time in opposition, Cerilli served as NDP critic for Housing, Workplace Safety, Health and Youth. She was regarded as one of the more left-wing members of caucus, and was the only Manitoba MLA to support Svend Robinson, rather than Lorne Nystrom, for the leadership of the federal NDP in 1995. The NDP were victorious in the 1999 provincial election, and Cerilli personally defeated Progressive Conservative Henry McDonald by 5198 votes to 3114. She was not appointed to cabinet, but served as legislative assistant to the Minister of Family Services and Housing. In 2003, she supported Bill Blaikie's campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party. Prior to the 2003 provincial election, she decided to leave her Radisson riding to run for the nomination in Wolseley. She lost to current MLA Rob Altemeyer. She now teaches part-time at the University of Winnipeg, and is operating a community development business. On September 15, 2006, Cerilli officially registered as a candidate for Mayor of the City of Winnipeg in the 2006 municipal election, but lost to incumbent mayor Sam Katz."

  "text" : "Mark C. Poloncarz (born November 7, 1967) is the county executive of Erie County, New York. Poloncarz, a Democrat, was elected county executive on November 8, 2011 after defeating the incumbent county executive Chris Collins a Republican by a 53 - 47 percentage point margin. Poloncarz was re-elected on November 3, 2015 with 66% of the vote when he easily defeated the Republican candidate Raymond Walter (33% of the vote) and Green Party candidate Eric Jones (1% of the vote). Poloncarz is only the 2nd Democrat to be elected to the position of county executive in the 51-year history of the position. Entering 2015 Poloncarz was heavily favored to be re-elected county executive; however it was expected he would face a Republican challenge from one of three candidates: incumbent county clerk and former New York Secretary of State Christopher Jacobs, incumbent county comptroller Stefan Mychajliw, or legislator Ed Rath, the grandson of the first Erie County Executive Edward Rath. In the end, all three individuals decided not to run and Walter was chosen by the Republicans. Unlike 2015, when Poloncarz entered the race in May 2011 he was a heavy underdog. However, by focusing on issues of providing efficient, yet cost-effective government, reducing waste, fraud and abuse of the public's tax dollars, supporting the \"People's Mandates,\" and properly funding libraries and arts and cultural institutions, Poloncarz was able to chip away a sizable Collins lead until he won in surprisingly easy fashion. Poloncarz also capitalized on his \"son of a steelworker\" blue collar background against Collins self-proclaimed businessman style. Since taking office as Erie County Executive, Poloncarz worked to change the culture of Erie County government and return it to its core mission: provide the programs and services that residents and taxpayers demand as effectively and efficiently as possible. And as such, he made it a priority to restore funding for what he calls the “People’s Mandates,” which include the rodent control program, parks improvements, road and bridge construction, libraries, summer youth programming and a renewed commitment to arts and cultural organizations. These programs were restored by Poloncarz in a fiscally responsible manner without raising taxes. As evidence of the fiscal stewardship, in 2014, Standard & Poor’s upgraded the county’s credit rating three steps to “AA-” and in 2015 Fitch Ratings upgraded the county's credit rating to \"A+.\" In early 2015, Poloncarz released “Initiatives for a Stronger Community,” his health and human services plan for Erie County. The plan included 49 separate initiatives to address issues of poverty throughout the county, including issues facing the City of Buffalo, which was identified as the 3rd poorest city in America when Poloncarz took office in 2012. Poloncarz also shepherded a pay equity policy through the Erie County Industrial Development Agency requiring all applicants for tax incentives to agree to a policy to provide salary data to the agency to prove they do in fact pay women equally. In 2015, Poloncarz also worked with the county legislature to pass a budget for 2016 that reduced the county's property tax rate from $4.99 to $4.96 per thousand of assessed value, the second year in a row the county's tax rate was reduced. 2014 was a significant year for the Poloncarz administration, including working with the legislature to pass a balanced budget with a small tax cut, opening the Erie County Health Mall, signing an executive order requiring that all contractors with Erie County comply with equal pay laws for women, restructuring the Department of Social Services to address issues with the Division of Child Protective Services, and managing the emergency response to four major weather-related events: two blizzards, flooding in West Seneca and the worst storm to hit the region in nearly 40 years: Winter Storm Knife a/k/a Snowvember Storm. In 2013, Poloncarz announced his “Initiatives for a Smart Economy,” which represents his administration’s commitment to a comprehensive, innovative approach to economic development and provides the “missing link,” tying a host of diverse initiatives into one regional development effort. Specifically, this plan includes a total of 64 initiatives across a dozen areas, representing the economic gears that, working together, will help drive our economic future. More than half of these Initiatives are complete and showing results around Erie County. In fact, since Poloncarz took office as county executive in January, 2012, more than 16,000 new private sector jobs have been created in the Buffalo-Niagara Metropolitan Area, and the county's unemployment rate has dropped from 8.9% in January, 2012 to 4.7% as of December, 2015. Additionally, Poloncarz has stated the key to his administration’s success is to create strong partnerships with other levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors, educational institutions and community groups. Examples include the creation of one of New York State’s first Land Banks, the establishment of the Erie County Medicaid Anti-Fraud Unit, as well as the successful negotiation of a new 10-year lease with the Buffalo Bills that is fair for local and state taxpayers and kept the team in Buffalo following the death of the team's owner Ralph Wilson Jr. At the time Poloncarz ran for county executive in 2011 he was the elected county comptroller in Erie County. Poloncarz was first elected comptroller in 2005 and was re-elected in 2009 in a three-person race by defeating Republican Phil Kadet and Independence Party candidate Michael Abramo by a 52 - 45 - 3 percentage point margin, respectively. Prior to being elected comptroller Poloncarz was an American business and finance lawyer residing in Buffalo, New York. Poloncarz was first elected county comptroller on a platform of restoring fiscal stability and accountability to the county by acting as the taxpayers \"watchdog.\" He is the first comptroller to be elected after a state control board was created and imposed over the county to oversee county finances. While he was the endorsed candidate of the county Democratic party, he defeated 2 challengers in the primary and then a Republican in the general election. Poloncarz has a bachelor's degree from the University at Buffalo and a law degree from the University of Toledo. Poloncarz was the 2003 - 2004 Buffalo and western New York coordinator and spokesman for the John Kerry presidential campaign. He was an at large district delegate for John Kerry at the 2004 Democratic National Convention and to Hillary Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Poloncarz was the founder and first president of the WNY Coalition for Progress, a progressive think tank in upstate New York which today is known as the Western New York Democrats for Progress."

  "text" : "Margaret L. Bridgman (January 10, 1940 – January 4, 2009) was a Canadian politician. Bridgman was a Member of Parliament from 1993 to 1997, representing the Canadian, federal electoral district of Surrey North in Surrey, British Columbia. Born in Kimberley, British Columbia, she was elected to Parliament for Surrey North in the 1993 election as a candidate of the Reform Party of Canada. In 2001, Bridgman unsuccessfully ran for the Reform Party of British Columbia in the riding of Surrey-Newton. Before entering politics, Brigdman was a police constable, a nurse, and a nurse administrator. As a young woman, Bridgman lived and worked in London as a police constable (traffic bobby). Subsequently, she trained in London as a psychiatric nurse, becoming a Registered Nurse (RN) and a Psychiatric Nurse (PN) before returning to Canada. Bridgman went on to earn the Director of Nursing designation from the University of Saskatchewan, rising to become a nurse administrator. In September 1993, the designated Reform Party candidate for Surrey North resigned his nomination. Bridgman was President of the Surrey North Reform Party Constituency Association, and she was selected to run as the Reform Party candidate. On October 25, 1993, Margaret Bridgman was elected the Member of Parliament for Surrey North, unseating the incumbent with a plurality of 6413 votes. Prior to Bridgman's landmark victory, Surrey North and its predecessor ridings had been held either by the New Democratic Party or the Progressive Conservative Party since 1958. Bridgman served as the Reform Party Critic on Health and Assistant Critic on Indian Affairs and Northern Development. She sat as the Reform Party member of the House of Commons Standing Committees on Health and on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, during the 35th Parliament. In her maiden speech in the House of Commons, Bridgman focused on the need for more effective and cost-conscious funding of health care in Canada. Bridgman's interventions in the House of Commons ranged from remarks on health care and Indian Affairs to young offenders, old age security, and the spending priorities of the Canadian parliament. In 1997, Bridgman was successfully challenged for the Reform Party nomination by Chuck Cadman. Bridgman opted not to run as an independent in the 1997 general election, and she did not run, again, in a federal, electoral race. Following the 1997 election, Bridgman returned to nursing in Surrey, British Columbia. After a sustained battle with lung cancer, Margaret Bridgman died at home on January 4, 2009."

After working several years as a Solicitor, Robson stood for, and was elected to, parliament on 29 August 1936 at a by-election for the seat of Vaucluse. He served many years on the backbenches, he enlisted in the Second World War and served with distinction during the war, gaining promotion to lieutenant colonel and receiving the Distinguished Service Order for his service. Returning to politics, he had missed the foundation of the Liberal Party of Australia in 1945. When long-time Leader Vernon Treatt resigned the leadership in 1954 and contests between Deputy Leader Robert Askin and Pat Morton became deadlocked he was asked to stand and was consequently elected as party leader and Leader of the Opposition. He served little more than a year before he was deposed by Pat Morton. In 1957 he retired from politics and returned to his legal career before retiring. He died of a heart attack in August 1974."

She was the first woman elected to the House of Commons from Manitoba. She was the daughter of Robert Arthur Rogers, a businessman, and Edith Rogers, the first woman ever elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. She married Gordon Konantz in 1922. During World War II, Margaret Konantz was an active volunteer for the Patriotic Salvage Corps, Bundles for Britain and the Women's Volunteer Services. In 1944, she was one of four women sent to Great Britain by the Canadian government to work with the Women's Voluntary Service. She was awarded the Order of the British Empire posthumously for her volunteer work in the war effort. Following the death of her husband in 1954, she volunteered for UNICEF, travelling to Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, The Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Rhodesia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and the United Arab Republic on behalf of the organization. She originally stood as the Liberal candidate for Winnipeg South in the 1962 election, but was defeated by Progressive Conservative incumbent Gordon Chown. When the minority government of John Diefenbaker fell the following year, however, Konantz defeated Chown in the 1963 election. In 1964 she was the only woman on a committee of 15 MPs selected by Prime Minister Lester Pearson to choose a new flag for Canada. She served as an MP until the 1965 election, when she was defeated by new Progressive Conservative candidate Bud Sherman. Also in 1963, she was a delegate to the United Nations Third Committee on Social, Economic and Humanitarian Problems. In this capacity, she toured a number of Indian reserves in Canada to study economic and health conditions. Following her electoral defeat in 1965, she became national chair for UNICEF Canada. She undertook several further international tours until her death in 1967."

  "text" : "Maurice Lamoureux is a former politician in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. He was an alderman for several years, and served as mayor of Sudbury from 1981 to 1982. Lamoureux was an office supervisor at Falconbridge Ltd. in private life. He retired in 1992, and later worked as a real estate representative with Coldwell Banker Marsh Real Estate. He was first elected as an alderman in the municipal election of 1964. He was twice defeated for the provincial New Democratic Party nomination, and later joined the Progressive Conservative Party. He was chosen as deputy mayor by council in 1978, and became acting mayor in 1981 when Jim Gordon suspended his duties to run for the provincial legislature. Gordon was elected to the legislature in the 1981 provincial election, and members of Sudbury City Council chose Lamoureux as his replacement on March 30, 1981. His only opponent, Sterling Campbell, withdrew before voting took place. Newspaper reports indicate that council declined to hold a by-election, even though almost twenty months remained in Gordon's two-year term. Lamoureux was chosen as mayor at a time of hostile relations between Sudbury City Council and the Sudbury Regional Council. He opposed a round of layoffs at Inco in 1982, and called on local businesses to support striking workers. Lamoureux brought forward what he described as a \"severe attrition policy\" in 1982, cutting 19 jobs to save $500,000 at city hall. Several senior bureaucrats were demoted, and many chose to resign. One of the bureaucrats to lose his job was city engineer Peter Wong, who later challenged Lamoureux for the mayoral position. Wong argued that it was inconsistent for Lamoureux to target the city's high unemployment rate while simultaneously cutting municipal jobs. On election day, Wong defeated Lamoureux for the mayor's position. Lamoureux was later re-elected to city council. In 1987, he argued that the city was losing money from selling surplus land at less than the assessed value. He criticized the federal government's cuts to unemployment insurance in 1989, arguing that it would devastate Sudbury's economy. Lamoureux campaigned for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1993 federal election as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party, and finished third against Liberal incumbent Diane Marleau. In 2000, he was appointed by provincial Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Tony Clement to a transitional board to amalgamate Sudbury and its neighbouring communities into the new city of Greater Sudbury. Board members were paid $400 per day. After his appointment, Lamoureux acknowledged that he was not entirely comfortable with an appointed board imposing terms on elected officials. He supported the board's decision to merge Sudbury Hydro, Capreol Hydro and Nickel Centre Hydro into Greater Sudbury Utilities, and said the board made the right decision in not selling the utilities to Ontario Hydro One. Lamoureux resigned from the transition board in October 2000 to run for the Greater Sudbury Municipal Council in the 2000 municipal election. He defended the work of the transition board, and called for tax cuts through the amalgamation process. He was defeated, finishing fifth in a two-member ward. He later applied to council for a position on Greater Sudbury Utilities, but was not hired. He ran again in the 2003 municipal election, calling for a five-year roads program. He finished sixth in the city's fourth ward. In May 2003, Lamoureux purchased a former nursing home in Sudbury called Garson Manor. He reopened the building the following year as alternative housing for seniors."

  "text" : "Mather Byles DesBrisay (March 19, 1828 – April 8, 1900) was a Canadian lawyer, judge, politician, and historian in the Province of Nova Scotia whose collections form the DesBrisay Museum in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia. A descendant of Captain Théophile de la Cour DesBrisay (1671–1761) whose Huguenot family fled religious persecution in France and settled in Dublin, Ireland before emigrating to Canada, Mather Byles DesBrisay was the great-great-grandson of Thomas DesBrisay, a Lieutenant-Governor of St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island). He was born in Chester, Nova Scotia and was educated in Halifax and Dartmouth. Trained in law, in 1851 Mather DesBrisay was admitted to the Bar of Nova Scotia. He eventually set up a law practice in his native Chester but in 1865 made Bridgewater his home. In 1867, DesBrisay entered provincial politics as part of the anti Confederation movement and in the Nova Scotia general election was voted to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. Reelected in 1874, the following year he was named Speaker of the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia. After 1875 DesBrisay was out of politics and in 1876 he married Ada Adams Harley. Mather DesBrisay served as a County Court judge for Lunenburg, Shelburne and Queens counties until 1897. An avid historian, in 1870 he published his book titled \"History of the County of Lunenburg.\" It marked what became a major pursuit of documentation that saw a revised edition of his book published in 1895. Following his death in 1900, the town of Bridgewater acquired his vast collection of papers and artifacts and established the DesBrisay Museum as a public community history museum. Mather and Ada DesBrisay are buried together in the Brookside Cemetery in Bridgewater."

During his term in office, the municipal council embarked on the town's first major public works projects, awarding contracts to M.N. McCarthy and W.H. Plummer for the construction of sewage, waterworks and electrical systems. However, the projects faced numerous delays, including a strike for higher wages by workers on the waterworks project, a cost overrun which forced the council to hold a referendum for authorization to spend the additional funds, and scheduling problems which resulted in the projects' completion being delayed by almost a year after the council voided the penalty clause which was its only mechanism for ensuring that the contractors finished the project on time. As a result, in that fall's municipal election, Biggar was defeated by former mayor Stephen Fournier. Following his defeat, Biggar disappeared from Sudbury in 1896, abandoning his law practice and his family. He was rumoured to have drowned in Lake Ramsey, but Sudbury resident Gus Harwood found him living in San Francisco in 1898. He had gone briefly to Yukon to prospect in the Klondike Gold Rush, but then moved to San Francisco after failing to stake a mining claim."

He came to the New Haven Colony from England prior to 1637. He was a collector for Yale College in 1645. He served as an officer in the Cavalry Troop of Connecticut from 1650-66. In February 1652, Camfield sold his home lot in New Haven. That year, he moved to Norwalk, becoming one of the area's original settlers. He lived in Norwalk for fourteen years, becoming one of the settlement's and the colony's prominent citizens. He was a deputy of the Connecticut General Court from Norwalk in 1654. In 1662, he was a magistrate and judge for the court in Fairfield. He was one of the 19 signers of the Petition to King Charles II for the Charter of the Colony. In 1666, Matthew removed to Newark, Province of New Jersey along with Robert Treat, where he was one of the founders of that town. His home lot was located at about the present north-west corner of Washington and Market Streets. Apparent his departure from Norwalk is based upon some dissatisfaction with the union of the New Haven and Hartford colonies. Canfield Island in East Norwalk is named for him. He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founding settlers of Norwalk in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery."

He was re-elected in the 1981 election. In the 1984 election, MacKay was defeated by New Democrat John Holm, finishing third behind Liberal Bill MacDonald. Controversy arose during the campaign, when MacKay admitted he used a false address to claim expenses as a member living away from the capital. In April 1985, an Auditor General's report asked MacKay to repay over $7,000 in extra expenses. The money was paid back and MacKay was not charged criminally. In February 2004, a political comeback bid ended when MacKay's candidacy for the Conservative nomination in Halifax West for the 2004 federal election was rejected by the party. MacKay attempted to return to provincial politics in the 2006 election, running for the Nova Scotia Liberal Party in Hants East, but finished third."

In 1965, he helped plan Martin Luther King Jr.'s entrance into Boston when he came to speak on Boston Common that spring. The major focus of King's speech on April 23 was school desegregation in Boston. The Haynes Early Education school located in Roxbury was aptly named in his honor. On 9 November 2006, Northeastern University President Joseph E. Aoun met with members of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Massachusetts at the People's Baptist Church (830 Tremont Street, Boston) to discuss possible collaborations between Northeastern and Lower Roxbury clergy. During the meeting, Reverend Michael E. Haynes suggested the University create a history of the African American community in Lower Roxbury. As a result, President Aoun appointed Joseph D. Warren, at that time Special Assistant to the Director of Government Relations and Community Affairs, to oversee the Lower Roxbury Black History Project. Warren appointed an advisory board consisting of Rev. Michael E. Haynes, formerly of Roxbury's Twelfth Baptist Church, Massachusetts State Representative Byron Rushing, Northeastern University Archivist Joan D. Krizack, and Northeastern University history professors."

After moving to Canada, and later British Columbia, he was president of the British Columbia Building Association and operated a dry goods, millinery, tailoring and grocery business. Cope defeated John Thomas Carroll in the 1892 mayoral election, one of the most hotly contested and closest in the city's history, winning with an 11 vote majority. He is the youngest elected mayor in the history of Vancouver, having been aged 32 at the time of his election. During the election, he garnered support of the city's business class, and the Vancouver World newspaper. His council however would consist of \"reformers\" of the working class, in opposition to Cope's representation of the business class. During his mayoralty, the city experienced an economic downturn; Cope responded by attempting to limit civic expenses, including the laying off of city employees, and initiating cutbacks. He also advocated for the Canada-Australia Steam Line, with the inaugural ship arriving in June 1893. Cope was a Freemason. He drowned during the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897 at Summit Lake, Yukon, when his horse fell while crossing the body of water. He tried unsuccessfully to rescue the horse and was pulled away by the undercurrents. His body was later transported back to Vancouver in the same vessel along with notorious American con artist Soapy Smith which resulted in a mixup of the bodies at their respective funerals. They were later switched upon the realization of the error. He was later buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver."

He served from 1 July 1896 to 1901. He was also an amateur painter, photographer and antique collector. He was born in Belper, Derbyshire, Britain and was educated at the Dollar Academy in Scotland and St Peter's School, York. He was a descendant of Mathew Swetenham, Henry IV's bow bearer. He was one of close to forty former British Empire officials to oppose the Malayan Union. Swettenham co-authored a \"A Dictionary of the Malay Language\" with Hugh Clifford. The dictionary, which was published in stages between 1894 and 1902, was abandoned after the letter 'G' as by then it had been made redundant by the publiciation of R.J. Wilkinson's \"A Malay English Dictionary\". He also published four books \"Malay Sketches\", \"Unaddressed Letters\", \"Also & Perhaps\" and \"Arabella in Africa\", the latter being illustrated by the famous mural painter and illustrator, Rex Whistler. The book was Whistler's first official commission."

Upon his death, the Oakland City Council voted unanimously to rename City Hall Plaza in his honor as the Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. The plaza displays a bronze bust of Ogawa. A Nisei, Ogawa was born in Lodi, California and never lived in Japan. Nevertheless, as Japanese Americans, the U.S. government involuntarily relocated Ogawa's family members to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Millard County, Utah and they were detained there for the duration of World War II. Ogawa married Grace Ogawa (née Hiruma) prior to their wartime detention and they had two children—Alan and Nancy. Nancy was born in the Topaz War Relocation Center but died at age 2. After the war, Ogawa returned to Oakland where he found work as a gardener. Eventually, he borrowed and saved enough money to open his own nursery. When Ogawa died, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, in her Tribute to Frank H. Ogawa, said: \"Frank Ogawa was a remarkable person because he could take personal misfortune and turn it into a positive learning experience for himself and others. When Frank and Grace Ogawa were forced to sell their belongings and live in internment camps during World War II, they had to sleep on straw mattresses in horse stalls for six months before beingshipped to a camp in Utah to spend another 3 1/2 years in confinement. Despite this mistreatment and injustice, he never lost faith in the United States. Just the opposite--he strived to prove his loyalty to his country and became an internationally recognized champion of Asian-Americans in the process.\" She went on to say \"Having served five years on the Oakland Parks Commission, Frank Ogawa was elected to the city council in 1966, making him the first Japanese-American to hold a council seat in a major city in the continental United States. He held that position for 28 years until his passing -- the longest tenure in Oakland's history.\" Ogawa was a member of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) from 1972 to 1988, having been appointed to the Commission by the Association of Bay Area Governments. Ogawa served on the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Board of Directors from 1979 until 1992 when he had to retire from the Board because of health issues. He served as Chairman of the Board during most of 1987 and served as Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board's Executive Committee and Personnel Committee. Ogawa was a Republican. However, he never held nor was he ever a candidate for any partisan office. As a public official, Ogawa was known as kind, optimistic, and adept at building consensus. In about December 1988, Ogawa underwent successful heart surgery. Ogawa died in Oakland on July 13, 1994, of lung cancer. He was survived by his wife Grace, son Alan, and by two grandchildren, Courtney and Matthew. More than 600 people, including a representative of Oakland's sister city of Fukuoka, Japan, attended Ogawa's memorial service."

During the time he operated a hospital and treated many during an epidemic of typhoid. He later settled at Cranbrook, British Columbia, in the Kootenay Valley in 1899 to establish a medical practice. He was one of the first and only physicians, a medical pioneer at Cranbrook. A partnership with Dr. James Horace King of Cranbrook which started in 1903 was described as a \"cornerstone in local medicine\", with modern innovations being in use at the time, two examples being the first x-ray machine in the city being purchased for their hospital and the use of automobiles within the practice. In the British Columbia general election, 1941, Green was elected as a Conservative to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for the district of Cranbrook. He was elected again in 1945 as a coalition member, serving until his retirement in 1949. He married Lillian Barbara Staples of Stillwater, Minnesota in June 1905. One of his sons, William Otis Green also became a doctor in the Cranbrook area, with whom he later shared a practice with. Frank W. Green died in 1953 of heart problems at St. Eugene Hospital in Cranbrook, which he had established. He was later cremated in Calgary. His wife Lillian died on October 22, 1965 at Cranbrook. The F. W.

His father, Dr. William Fee moved to Melbourne in 1884, and Frank Fee moved to Melbourne from Franklin, in 1887. He opened a hardware store and mortuary named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Charles H. Stewart, who had also served as mayor. Fee was in the hardware business in Pennsylvania. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. He served as city alderman in Fort Pierce from 1904 to 1905, and as mayor from 1905 to 1907. Fee apparently had advanced views for his times. He opposed the death penalty and he supported compulsory education."

He represented the electoral district of Kings West in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1971 to 1978. He was a member of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party. Bezanson was born in Westville, Nova Scotia and was educated there. He was an insurance agent. In 1948, he married Wanda Alice Banks. Bezanson made his first attempt at entering provincial politics in the 1967 election, but lost to Progressive Conservative Gordon Tidman by 97 votes. He ran again in the 1970 election, with Tidman winning the seat on election night by 16 votes. However a recount resulted in a tie with both Bezanson and Tidman receiving 3735 votes. The returning officer cast the deciding vote for Tidman, declaring him the winner. The Liberals appealed the result and a judge declared the vote null and void and ordered a by-election. On November 16, 1971, Bezanson won the by-election, defeating Progressive Conservative Fred Chisholm by 323 votes. Bezanson was re-elected in the 1974 election. He was defeated by Progressive Conservative George Moody when he ran for re-election in the 1978 election. He died in Toronto, Ontario on November 10, 1993."

  "text" : "Georges-Casimir Dessaulles (September 29, 1827–April 19, 1930), was a Canadian businessman, statesman and senator. Dessaulles holds the record for the oldest serving politician. Appointed to the Canadian Senate representing the Province of Quebec in 1907 at age 80, Dessaulles served for 23 years before dying at age 102. Dessaulles was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Lower Canada in 1827, the son of Jean Dessaulles and a nephew of Louis-Joseph Papineau. Before becoming senator, Dessaulles was president of the Bank of Saint-Hyacinthe, and mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe. He also represented Saint-Hyacinthe in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1897 to 1900. He was a last-minute candidate for the provincial seat, having been nominated after the death of the previous candidate, his son-in-law Maurice St-Jacques. In 1857, he had married Émilie-Emma, the daughter of judge Dominique Mondelet; in 1869, he married Louise-Frances Leman after the death of his first wife. His 100th birthday was marked as a historic moment in the senate, because Dessaulles had become only the second sitting senator to reach the age of 100 (the other being David Wark). At his death in 1930, Dessaulles was the oldest sitting politician in the world. To date, no one has beaten this record. Dessaulles is also renowned for only having spoken twice while serving as a Senator. Once to deny that his appointment was part of a corrupt bargain, and a second time to thank his fellow senators for his portrait, on his 100th birthday. His daughter Henriette Dessaulles became a noted writer and journalist."

  "text" : "Gerald Joseph Doucet (born May 4, 1937) is a Canadian politician and lobbyist. He represented the electoral district of Richmond in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1963 to 1974, as a Progressive Conservative. Born in Grand Étang, Nova Scotia in 1937, Doucet graduated from St. Francis Xavier University in 1958, and went on to earn a law degree from Dalhousie University in 1961. Doucet was first elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the 1963 general election, defeating Liberal leader Earl Urquhart by 83 votes in the Richmond riding. He was re-elected in 1967 and 1970. He served in the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Provincial Secretary, and Minister of Education. When appointed in 1964, Doucet was the first Acadian cabinet minister in the provinces history. He ran for leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia at the party's 1971 leadership convention, finishing second to John Buchanan. Starting in 1984, Doucet was a member of the successful but sometimes controversial Ottawa consulting firm Government Consultants International (GCI), along with Frank Moores, Francis Fox, and Gary Ouellet (The Insiders, by John Sawatsky, 1987; On The Take, by Stevie Cameron, 1994). In 2004 he published his biography, \"Acadian Footprints\". He is the brother of Fred Doucet, who served as Brian Mulroney's first Chief of Staff when he became leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party in 1983, and served on his staff in the Prime Minister's Office while Mulroney was Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993."

  "text" : "Greg J. Curtis (born October 18, 1960) is a Lobbyist and Attorney from Utah. He is married to Teresa Curtis and the father of six children and eight grandchildren. A Republican, he is a former member of the Utah State House. He formerly represented the state's 49th house district in Sandy and Cottonwood Heights. He formerly served as the Speaker of the House. Curtis was first elected to the State Legislature in 1994, defeating a fellow Republican in the primary. Curtis grew up in his district in Sandy and served a two-year LDS mission to New Zealand. He has worked for a private law firm; as a prosecutor for West Jordan City; and as staff counsel for County Mayor Nancy Workman. Curtis graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in accounting and then received a law degree from the University of Utah. Beginning in October 2008, Curtis was plagued by accusations from several former state employees who claimed that Curtis abused his government position to benefit his legal clients financially. One of these former employees, Doug Clark, claimed that Curtis cut funding and caused layoffs to anyone who opposed his plans to build a public transit facility in the midst of an ancient Native American settlement in Draper, Utah. Changing the location of the proposed facility would have kept land owners in the area from moving forward with subsequent development plans. Clark said that Curtis told him, *“Doug, I am the speaker of the House. If I want something, I get it. ... I want you to talk to DNR to figure out a way to get that road through there. I know this may sound a little strange. You may think it is unethical — because it probably is — because effectively I’m asking you as a state employee to work for me and do work for my law client.” On November 4, 2008, Curtis became the first sitting Speaker of the House in Utah to fail to win re-election in 40 years. Democrat Jay Seegmiller won by over 10% - nearly 1,400 votes. With this result, it became apparent that the public was fed up with Curtis's alleged abuse of power. For the 2009 legislative session, Curtis returned to Utah's Capitol Hill - not as a state representative - but as a lobbyist representing several large companies, including Intermountain Healthcare, UTA, Altria Group, parent company of Philip Morris."

He was born in California to screenwriter John Michael Hayes and Mildred \"Mel\" (née Hicks) Hayes. Garrett was raised in Maine and moved back to California in 1969, where he later attended Beverly Hills High School and California State College at Bakersfield. He moved to Georgia in 1991 and currently serves as the secretary of the Cobb County Libertarian Party. After serving in a number of roles with the both county and state Libertarian organizations in Georgia, Hayes sought and won the party nomination for governor in 2002 and again in 2006. Hayes received 2.3% of the vote in 2003 and 3.8% of the vote in 2006. In his second run at office, Hayes set several benchmarks for third party politics in the state, beginning with being the first Libertarian to run twice for governor. Hayes’s campaign was the first Libertarian gubernatorial campaign to produce and run television advertisements in Georgia. He also garnered the highest polling numbers to date for a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate in the state, polling as high as 9% in one non-partisan poll, leading to press speculation that Hayes might force an unprecedented runoff electionbetween incumbent Republican Sonny Perdue and Democratic rival Lieutenant Governor Mark Taylor. Though a runoff did not in fact result, Hayes still gathered both the highest number and the highest percentage of votes for a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate in Georgia. Hayes currently co-hosts a weekly Libertarian-themed political radio talk show on radio station WHIE in Griffin, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta."

A lawyer by profession, Fitzgerald was first elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the 1960 provincial election representing Halifax Northwest for the Progressive Conservative and was re-elected in 1963. In 1967 he was elected in the new riding of Halifax Cobequid. In 1969, he was appointed Speaker and served until the 1970 provincial election in which the Conservative government was defeated and Fitzgerald lost his seat. Following his defeat, Fitzgerald returned to his legal practice and was one of the province's top trial lawyers in the 1970s. In 1978, he was convicted for falsifying tax return forms, and was disbarred by the Nova Scotia Bar Association for fraud. In 1980, he was convicted of raping a female client in his office and sentenced to five years imprisonment. He was paroled in 1981 after serving ten months of his sentence and was pardoned in 1992. In 1982, Fitzgerald was awarded a five-month $15,000 contract by the Nova Scotia Liquor Commission to study proposed changes to the Liquor Control Act. The appointment was met with outrage by the Opposition in the House of Assembly and he resigned the appointment. Fitzgerald attempted a political comeback in the 1993 provincial election and contested the Progressive Conservative nomination in Dartmouth South to run against Liberal leader John Savage. He won the nomination by a margin of 29 votes to 25 votes for his opponent, Dartmouth city councillor Colin May but Conservative Premier Donald Cameron refused to sign Fitzgerald's nomination papers due to Fitzgerald's rape conviction. May was awarded the nomination instead. Fitzgerald died on May 1, 2014 at a hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia, aged 87."

  "text" : "Gary Schiff (born February 3, 1972, as Gary J. Schiffhauer) is an American politician and activist who represented Ward 9 on the Minneapolis City Council. A member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL), he was first elected in 2001 and re-elected in 2005 and 2009. Prior to his political career, Schiff was involved with a variety of activist groups and causes ranging from human rights with the Human Rights Campaign, to historic preservation with Save Our Shubert. During his city council tenure, Schiff worked to ease ordinances prohibitive to small businesses, especially microbreweries, and strongly advocated against a publicly funded stadium for the Minnesota Vikings. In January 2013, Schiff began a campaign for Mayor of Minneapolis in the 2013 election but after an unsuccessful DFL endorsement convention, dropped out of the race and backed an opponent (the eventual winner) in mid-June. His third and final term on the City Council ended in January 2014."

In 2006, he was appointed as an interim councillor in ward 41, and was then elected as the councillor for Ward 43 in Scarborough East. On February 1, 2006, City Council appointed Ainslie to fill the vacancy in Ward 41 that was created when Bas Balkissoon was elected in a provincial by-election in the riding of Scarborough-Rouge River. A condition of the appointment was that he would not run as a candidate in the 2006 election. However, when councillor David Soknacki announced his intention not to run in Ward 43, Ainslie put his name forward as a candidate to replace him. Ainslie used to be an executive assistant to Soknacki. Soknacki supported Ainslie's candidacy. During the election campaign in 2006, a video surfaced which showed Ainslie promising to Toronto City Council not to run. \"I will not run in Ward 41, or any other ward in the city.\" His campaign literature urged voters to \"return\" him to city hall. He said that his campaign team suggested using the word \"re-elect\". Ainslie said, \"I didn't think it was proper.\" Despite the controversy, he elected in Ward 43. In April 2007, he determined that it costs $20,000 annually to provide councillors and staff at City Hall offices with free coffee every day. He moved a motion in committee to remove the expense, but it failed to pass. During the Rob Ford drug allegation scandal, Ainslie was removed as chair from the city's government management committee and appointed as chair of the parks and environment committee. On October 11, 2013 he resigned from the mayor's executive committee and his role as chair of the parks and environment committee over differences with Ford's longterm strategic direction for the city. On May 3, 2013, Ainslie was stopped by a RIDE check on Kingston Road and was given a three-day licence suspension."

Born in Lismore in Northern New South Wales to a prominent political family and educated at Lismore High School, Morton left school at fourteen to be employed in a legal firm, before branching out into various businesses. Moving to Sydney, Morton first entered politics in 1944 as an Alderman on Mosman Municipal Council, rising to be Mayor in 1946. Morton then entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 3 May 1947, representing the Electoral district of Mosman for the Liberal Party of Australia. Morton soon rose through the party ranks, becoming touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested the leadership in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton then stood, but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take the leadership. Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected to succeed him as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition. Morton contested as Leader the 1956 and 1959 elections, gaining seats each time but failing to defeat the long-standing Labor Government. A few months after the 1959 election, Morton was deposed as Leader by now-Deputy Leader Askin in July 1959. He remained on the backbenches until Askin led the Liberal Party to its first electoral victory in May 1965, whereupon Morton was appointed as the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Highways. He served in the cabinet, becoming prominent and controversial in his role in the reorganisation of the City of Sydney as Local Government Minister and state planning regulations, until he retired from parliament in June 1972. He died in Mosman aged 88 in 1999."

In 2006, he began a private prosecution against Michael Barrymore for alleged drugs and drink offences committed on the night Stuart Lubbock was found dead at the entertainer's home. Bennett co-wrote a book with Terry Lubbock, the father of Stuart Lubbock, Not Awight: Getting Away With Murder, explaining their theory that Stuart Lubbock died as a result of a violent attack on him which Barrymore and his associates that night covered up. He has also campaigned against the parents of Madeleine McCann, who disappeared while on a family holiday in Portugal in 2007. He asserted that they should have been prosecuted for child neglect and accused them of covering up what happened to their daughter, a charge which ultimately led to the family successfully pursuing legal action against him."

After working for the World Bank and in the private sector, he purchased a farm where he established a commercial vineyard and co-founded the Virginia Wineries Association. In 2002, Governor Mark Warner named Weed 5th District Trustee for the Virginia Land Conservation Trust Fund. In 2006, Weed faced competition for the Democratic Party nomination. Former Roanoke City Manager Bern Ewert argued that Weed had been beaten \"like a drum\" in 2004 and would probably lose again. Nevertheless, on May 20, 2006, Weed was chosen as the Democratic nominee by a 114-73 vote of the delegates to the party convention. In Weed's 2006 campaign, he emphasized the need for better treatment of military veterans. One of his campaign proposals was to establish a college for disabled veterans in the district. In both his campaigns, he advocated withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq."

He is currently the Member of the Parliament of Malaysia for the Kalabakan constituency in Sabah, representing the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in the governing Barisan Nasional coalition. Before entering federal politics, Abdul Ghapur was active in Sabah state politics, initially as a member of the Sabah People's United Front (commonly known as BERJAYA). He joined UMNO when it moved into the state in the early 1990s and was a Deputy Chief Minister in the Barisan Nasional state government between 1995 and 1997. He was elected unopposed to federal Parliament in 2004, for the newly created seat of Kalabakan on the border between Malaysia and Indonesia in East Sabah. In 2008, after his reelection (again unopposed), he was appointed as a Deputy Minister for Resources and Natural Environment by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, only to resign eight days later. Later that year he openly criticised the Barisan Nasional government in Parliament for overlooking the needs states of Sabah and Sarawak, which had voted resoundingly in favour of Barisan Nasional in the 2008 election. He again spoke out against the federal government for what he considered to be its slow response to the invasion of part of East Sabah by Filipino militants in 2013. At the same time, he criticsed UMNO's internal election process as being open to corruption, claiming that \"people will do anything just to get on the Supreme Council even if it’s very expensive\"."

  "text" : "Alex M. Torpey (born August 10, 1987 in New York City) is a non-party affiliated American politician and consultant. Torpey was elected as the 48th Village President (equivalent of mayor) of South Orange, New Jersey in May 2011 for a four-year term by a 14-vote margin. At the age of 23 years at the time of being sworn in (May 16, 2011), he was the youngest Village President in South Orange’s history, and at that time the youngest serving mayor in the state of New Jersey. Torpey was one of the youngest mayors in the United States to oversee a municipality the size of South Orange, which has 16,000 full-time residents plus approximately 7,000 Seton Hall University students at their South Orange campus. On June 20, 2014, nearly 1 year before his first term was over, he announced he would not seek re-election to a second term. Torpey's term ended May 18 when he swore-in South Orange's second-youngest, and first female, Village President, Sheena Collum, whom he supported in the election, and had served with for two previous years on South Orange's governing body. Torpey was born in New York City, and raised first in Maplewood, then South Orange, and is an alumnus of Columbia High School (2005). Torpey completed his undergraduate degree in Political Science, American Government and Law at Hampshire College, while also serving as student government president. He also holds a Master of Public Administration in emergency management from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. Torpey founded is a managing partner of Veracity Media LLC, a social-impact consulting firm. Torpey also founded a nonpartisan initiative, Rethink Leadership, to help encourage young people to consider elected office and local government as a way to become more involved and active in their government and public policy issues. Torpey was named a 2013-2014 James Madison Fellow at the bi-partisan Millennial Action Project for his work in encouraging young people towards civics participation. Torpey also serves on the advisory board of the New Jersey chapter of the New Leaders Council and on Sustainable Jersey's Community Information and Citizen Engagement Initiative. Starting in the fall semester of 2014, Torpey was appointed adjunct faculty of governance and technology at Seton Hall University, co-teaching with Dr. Matt Hale, master of public administration students on topics of collaboration and technology innovation in government. Torpey’s philosophy of governance relies heavily on the use of technology, media and communications to increase interactivity, transparency and efficiency towards the ends of better government. He has written and lectured on these topics frequently prior to his election and since. While in office, Torpey primarily worked on a number of fiscal, economic development, public safety, transparency, community engagement and organizational development initiatives, in addition to petitioning utility companies for better preparedness efforts after Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy; along with several other New Jersey mayors, performing one of the first legal same-sex marriages in the state in 2013 (as well as being a vocal advocate on the issue); advocating for better open data standards, a tuition-credit program for volunteer first responders and updates to homelessness and veterans support programs. In addition to his official municipal responsibilities as Village President, Torpey served as a member and EMT of the South Orange Rescue Squad. Torpey also served as South Orange's municipal Office of Emergency Management Coordinator."
